Baird Operator : Ladies and gentlemen thank you for standing by and welcome to the Eaton First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions). As a remainder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host Senior VP of Investor Relations, Mr. Don Bullock. Please go ahead. Don Bullock : Good morning. I'm Don Bullock, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Welcome to Eaton's first quarter 2014 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Sandy Cutler, Chairman and CEO; and Rick Fearon, Vice Chairman and CFO. As has been our historical practice we will begin today's call with comments from Sandy, followed by a question-and-answer sessions later in the day. I do want to let you know that we understand many of you have a very tight schedule today with a number of calls; what we will do is we will be holding our call to an hour today in respect for the fact that many of you have a number of those to try to get to. Before I turn it over to Sandy, I want to take a moment to draw your attention to the statement on Page 2 of our presentation. Our presentation today contains forward-looking statements. The comments on page two outline factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those in the statements. These factors are noted in today's press release and related form 8-K. In addition our presentation also includes non-GAAP measures, as defined by the SEC rules. A reconciliation of those measures to the most directly comparable GAAP equivalent is provided at the Investor Relations section of our website at www.eaton.com. And at that point I'll turn it over to Sandy. Sandy Cutler : Great, thanks Don, and thank you all for joining us this morning. I'm going to work from the earnings presentation that was out on our website; hopefully you have all had a chance to download this morning. Our first quarter, I'm to going to turn to page 3 to start this morning. Our first quarter was largely in line with our own expectations despite the concerns we have had about the challenging winter here in the U.S. so we've spoken about a couple of times this winter. I think one way of thinking about the year, this winter is that we were able to largely recover from the revenue impact from it. But we did incur some higher cost to do so through expediting and overtime. A couple of highlights on this front chart that hopefully will give you a good summary for what's in the pack today is that we did achieve operating EPS of $1.01 that included as we've said about $0.03 or about $13 million of premium expediting and overtime cost virtually all incurred in our Electrical Systems and Services business and that's because our major facilities are located right in the area the Carolinas so that that got hit particularly hard that knocked out workdays for us in January and February. Our core growth, I'm really pleased with 4.5% that was partially offset by the 1% of negative ForEx. We are confirming today our full year guidance $4.70 no change. But it does now include a $40 million charge for a restructuring in our industrial sector. I'll talk a little bit more about that. That's about an $0.08 hit in the second quarter this year. Our markets still we think will grow at about 3% this year, no change in that. Cooper integration remains very much on track and really pleased that we will be getting that $95 million of synergies this year, another $150 million next year. Further buttressed by the next claim which are the results of the restructuring we are undertaking in our industrial sector so another $35 million there. So the year-to-year 2014 to 2015 self-help story is now $185 million and we think that's very powerful. Second quarter guidance for operating earnings per share of $1.05 to $1.15, a midpoint of $1.10 and that does include the $40 million of restructuring charge that I referenced. The last piece I think helpful news as you think about how the year rolls out is that we did experience this winter some negative impact in terms of the large projects placements in our electrical business, you saw that in the negative 6% bookings in our Electrical Systems and Services business and as we watch April roll out, electrical book quotations and bookings are clearing strengthening in April and really pleased with that tone that we are seeing as we gotten off running in the first month of the second quarter. If we turn to page 4, just a couple of highlights of the results, operating earnings up 21% really powerful, we think in a period of time of relatively slow end market growth, operating earnings per share up 20%. We recognize that $0.06 of that achievement was due to you will recall a year ago in the first quarter we incurred about $0.06 of purchase price accounting and inventory step-up charges those didn't occur this year. So without that $0.06 this is a very solid 13% increase in terms of our operating earnings. Sales I mentioned before $5.5 billion very much in line with our guidance of 3.5% and that's a net of the very strong 4.5% organic growth the best quarter in the last eight quarters in that regard. You go all the way back to the first quarter of 2012 when we had a 4.50% organic growth number. Segment margins very much in line with our own expectations 14.50%, up 50 basis points that's in spite of the $13 million of increased cost due to weather that's about 0.2% that impact. If we turn to chart 5, volume again very much on our guidance and on our expectations and so really when we look at the puts and takes in the quarter pretty minor. Little lower corporate expense and we talked at the end of February that as we had seen weather impacting us in January and February we were working very hard to contain problematic expenses. You see that really on this line with $0.04 of benefit. Lower taxes this is just really a decimal point by a penny. Negative weather I mentioned the $13 million or negative $0.03. And then a little higher currency translation that you saw, of the negative $56 million number, we thought it was going to be a little closer to $30 million so overall about a penny better than our guidance this year. You will also recall for those of you who are trying to trace our corporate expenses if you remember in the fourth quarter of 2013, we had incurred about $20 million of Cooper related costs and then we also told you this year that we would getting about $2 million per quarter of synergies on the Cooper line and that's part of how you trace from the fourth quarter to the first quarter. If we turn to page 6, quick financial summary, really nothing more to highlight given the numbers I have obviously the volume is up a net 3.5%, the margin is up 50 basis points. You can see the very strong core growth. I'm going to operate into the segments here in light of our time today. If we start on page 7, titled Electrical Products segment, volume was very much in line with what we had expected, very solid increase in terms of operating margins. I think very significantly the first quarter bookings were up 6% more than the shipments. I think that's reflecting our forward look here, strongest in Americas, weakest in Asia-Pacific. But I think the really good news here is both in the Americas and in EMEA we had very solid mid-digit increases. And it really reflects in this particular segment because most of these products are flowing through distributors this outgrowth is really due to distributor channel conversions, which are beginning really to build and you will remember one of the very important sources of revenue synergy in our acquisition of Cooper so really very, very pleased. As I mentioned the tone in April is quite good and I think as you can imagine the northeast and the central and the southeast portions of the country were hit pretty hard in the first quarter and we're seeing those areas come back in spite of that weather problem, really good momentum here in terms of distribution channel. Our lighting strength continues and very importantly the LED penetration in terms of our overall lighting excited the quarter about 37%. I'm very pleased with the technology leadership we have there, a very strong growth across the board there. The majority of the operational synergies and you remember in our guidance for this year, we said about 75% of those synergies would drop into this segment, again part of the reason for the very strong 150 basis point increase in terms of our operating margins. If we turn to page 8, entitled Electrical Systems and Services segment, here the volume is pretty much in line with where we thought they were going to be but clearly the 12.8% margin down a 130 basis points from a year ago, I'm sure raises some questions in your own mind. Really three things to really think about here the weather impact $13 million that's worth about 0.9% in this segment. We do not expect that to repeat. I'm pretty confident we are not going to have heavy snows during the second quarter. The unfavorable mix and we did talk about the fact on bookings that bookings were down 6%. That big impact was really right here in the United States and that's where it occurred; the United States and Canada. And we saw a real paucity of large projects being coded and awarded in the U.S. and Canada, now that has changed as we have gotten into April and that's a very good news. But that impact gave us a little bit of negative mix as well and that was about $6 million negative mix impact. And then the last item is something that will be with us all this year even though it is in our full year guidance, I will get to it a little later in the packet. We've raised the margin guidance for the electrical product segment by 25 basis points and we've lowered the guidance for the Electrical Systems and Services segment by 25 basis points. It's about $4 million a quarter. We've made a as we have had the chance to manage these combined businesses a little longer, we have looked at the allocation of some of the overheads between the businesses and we think it's more appropriate that we shifted about $4 million a quarter to this segment from the product segment. You put those three together, three-tenths that comes from unfavorable mix, the nine-tenths from weather, the two-tenths from allocation that's about 1.4 points and you can get a sense that we think this business was pretty much in line without those items and we don't expect the weather to occur and we expect the next piece to come back, now that we're seeing the recovery in the business here in the second quarter. If I move it on then to the Hydraulic segment, this is page 9. We think a very strong quarter of performance, 3% of volume growth, but you can see the core growth is actually 6% and we had negative ForEx of 3 points. So you're seeing I think pretty strong volume top-line growth. The bookings up another very solid 9% as you can see below and then the profits up 240 basis points to 14.3% so whether you compare it to the fourth quarter or the first quarter, very strong margin performance here. Getting within the bookings is to get a sense for them in within the 9% clearly the big pluses here were on the mobile side, you saw construction is up very strongly. And so construction up strongly, mining and ag weak. In the stationary side, led by oil and gas, very strong performance in that segment. One that also we're also quite strong in our electrical businesses as well. And if you take our actual bookings for the last two quarters, the first quarter 2014 and the fourth quarter 2013, and compare them to the two quarters a year before, each of those, we are averaging about 13% increase in bookings. And so I think you're really seeing the backlog building the tenure of the market improving and you can see from our results we are really demonstrating in terms of both the volume and the margins. I would also mention that April will continue very much in this regard. If I move to chart 10, which is the Aerospace segment, our volume is up some 7%, 2 points of that positive ForEx or 5% volume increase. Our operating profit is pretty flat with the year ago margin is down slightly. This is a continuation really of the mix that we've been talking to you about and you see it within our first quarter bookings albeit in this segment we report our quarterly bookings and they can be pretty bumpy depending upon which large OEM orders are booked in the quarter. Very strong commercial strength offset by quite a bit of military and that's the real story behind the bookings. The very good news is within those overall bookings, our aftermarkets was up some 15% and we have been talking to you for several quarters about the fact that we had expected to see an uptick occur at some point, we were very pleased on both the commercial and military side in the aftermarket. Just a quick update on the divestiture. We do expect it to close within the second quarter and you recall that decreased revenue for the full year, and decreased profit for the full year was already in our guidance for this year we had detailed that when we went through the open initial guidance for the year. For those of you who were looking at the 13.4 margin in the first quarter and asking is that really in line with our expectation for our full year guidance, yes it is, this is very much how we anticipated the year laying out. Now moving to chart 11, which is the Vehicle segment, a very strong quarter performance and you see 6% revenue gain actually 9% core growth, offset by 3% negative ForEx very strong margin improvement, you can see a 110 basis points. I think everyone will recall in the fourth quarter we had experienced some launch challenges that had caused about $17 million of higher cost in the fourth quarter those have been largely resolved. You see that in the margin hopping back. We had told you we expected margins to come back in line with normal first quarters as you can see it's actually a little stronger than the normal first quarter so very pleased. I think the big news from a market potential is that you saw the March NAFTA heavy duty orders come in at 27,400 units and we saw 91,000 of orders in the first quarter. We saw an industry backlog of 118,000 units in the first quarter and from all we are hearing April orders again will be we think relatively strong. All of that has let us to increase our Class A heavy duty market forecast and again this is NAFTA that we provide to 280,000. We think it will lay out with about 67,000 in the first quarter stepping up to 72,000 in the second quarter, and then sort of flat lining along the line of 71,000 to 70,000 for the remainder of the year. What is offsetting that is what we spoke to you about in our earnings guidance for the full year is that we were seeing South America start the year weak and we had originally forecasts those markets would be down a couple percent. We actually think they will be down closer to 4% at this point and so a little bit of an offset, if you will, in terms of the South American impact. Moving to page 12, which is our 2014 end market growth forecast as you can see really no change overall, but we did move up our vehicle forecast by 1 point frankly it doesn't round the total of the 3% up for us, but that really recognizes that the heavy duty market in North America is little stronger and no change in the U.S. retail sales outlook for light vehicle, but weak in South America across the board. Moving to page 13, our margin expectations by segments you can see the aforementioned change between electrical products and Electrical Systems and Services still comes out to the same overall number for the total electrical business in terms of what we expect this year, and if you look down to the bottom of 15.75% that's still our expectation there as well. So no changes on this chart just a remainder that the 2015 segment margin of 17% does have the benefit of $150 million of additional synergy going from 2014 to 2015 in our electrical segments and now an additional $35 million of benefit that comes from the just announced restructuring in our industrial business. So $185 million, if you will, of self-help in terms of achieving those margins in 2015. Now moving to chart 14, entitled 2014 EPS guidance. We are providing our first guidance for the second quarter. I mentioned it before, a midpoint of $1.10 operating earnings per share, the net income number of midpoint of a $1.05 does reflect $35 million of second quarter restructuring expense as we look at the overall year, I will talk a little bit more about full year restructuring in just a moment. No change to the full year either range or midpoint of operating earnings or net income. So the $4.70 is the exact same number up 14% from last year that we provided in our full year initial guidance. Moving to page 15, really just some tweaks in terms of this overall guidance its still $4.70. I will draw your eye to just a couple line items the organic growth of roughly 3% still the same number of about $990 million of volume; it is now at $0.50 versus the $0.56. We do not think we will cover the $0.03 of the weather expense that we got in the first quarter and the rest I would describe as rounding slightly different number in terms of interest and pension, we had thought earlier that was a benefit of about $0.20, we think it's going to be closer to $0.16. And then when you come down to the tax rate, we had a negative $0.44 there in the first quarter. As we work through the details we think it's going to be closer to $0.26. Obviously we introduced an $0.08 restructuring charge into the last item in the yellow block there as well, still leading us that to our overall $4.70 of guidance. Moving to chart 16, entitled we remain on track to deliver our Cooper synergy projections, no changes on the sale synergies, the cost-out the total operational synergies you will note that under the acquisition integration cost we have lowered the expenses that we expect to spend this year to achieve our full program and the full program has not changed neither breadth or in benefits. We just think we can get it done for about $10 million less. You actually saw that materialize in the first quarter where our actual spending was about $66 million versus the original guidance we have provided you for $76 million. Nothing to interpret from that about any change in program or benefits that we're achieving, all we expected to do is just getting it done at about $10 million less expense. If we move on to Chart 17; hopefully a helpful first look into our second quarter, and let me step through these. We start with $1.01, being our operating EPS in the first quarter. We've then got five items that lead to a total of a plus of 23%, a fairly typical movement for us in terms of volume of about 5% between the second quarter and the first quarter that would lead us to think volumes will be up on the order of about $275 million over the first quarter, and our incrementals that yields about $0.13. Then you'll see we're anticipating a little lower pension expense than we saw in the first quarter. We won't have we believe the weather cost impact of the $13 million in the second quarter. We'll get additional Cooper synergies the same way we had laid them out for this year, no change there, another $0.02 there, slightly lower interest as well. And then three negatives of the industrial sector restructuring I spoke about. Let me just talk to that for a moment. The reason we're doing this is not that our volumes were lower in the first quarter than we anticipated, but when we look at world GDP, certainly the world is experiencing, what I call, some growth anxieties, whether people are worried about the China market not materializing as strongly, or the Ukrainian impact potentially in Europe, or the political elections in India, or the U.S. economy showing different degrees of growth in different sectors, we just felt it was prudent to go ahead and get going on this, and ensure we've got the self-help to propel our earnings into 2015, and that's a negative $0.08. Higher corporate expense, we have provided you a guidance of $82 million per quarter. We came in at $64 million in the first quarter. As I mentioned, we had really worked to try to hold those expenses down in the first quarter and we want to return to get back to a number of the growth investments that we think are important to continue to push the company ahead, and we tend to have our expenses move up as we go through the year in terms of corporate expense as well. And then just a very slightly higher tax rate, probably a little bit north of the 5% number here in the second quarter and all that leads us to our $1.10 guidance for the second quarter. If you move to Page 18, this is the 2014 outlook, no changes. The only change here on this page is that we're providing second quarter guidance that I just reviewed for the first time. So we think a clean quarter. We were able to offset the impact of weather. We're feeling better about the booking situations now in terms of our electrical business particularly there on the side of the Systems and Services side, and we think we enter the second quarter on a strong note. So with that, Don, let me turn things back to you for questions. Don Bullock : Okay. If you will, can you provide the instructions? Operator : (Operator Instructions) Don Bullock : Our first question comes from Scott Davis from Barclays. Operator : Please go ahead. Scott Davis - Barclays: I wanted to talk a little bit about big picture. I mean, Sandy, when you think about the Cooper integration, now you've anniversaried, you've had enough time I think to do the heavy lifting. I mean, is it -- do you think about potentially pulling forward your interest in doing M&A again particularly in electrical? Sandy Cutler : Yes, we, Scott, I think we've been consistent. First, let me just say we're really pleased with where we are in the overall integration, grade us as being slightly ahead of where we had hoped to be on the broad array of complex issues we're taking on. But we've really traced our ability to do M&A to two things. One, obviously finishing this integration activity, and we've said that mature year is 2016. And so I think it's going to be late '15, to what we're kind of back in a more active stage in that regard. And the second is, obviously paying off the acquisition debt and you'll recall that we had outlined about $2.1 billion of debt that we were going to be paying back and the last tranche of that is in the first quarter of 2016. So I think that's more likely the time period. We're obviously out continuing in the quoting activities, but unlikely to be at the altar if you're on anything substantial much ahead of that time table. Scott Davis - Barclays: And then just a follow-up. We've talked a little bit about -- I don't think at least in your prepared comments, you talked about channel inventories. I mean, sometimes these things can whip around a little bit ahead of the building season. I mean what's your sense of where your customers are at now? Are they stocking up as usual seasonally, or are they stocking up more so than usual because they anticipate a bigger pull-through -- sell-through? Sandy Cutler : Yes, I think our best sense, Scott, NAAD is going on right now. So we've had a chance to have a lot of conversations with distributors in our electrical businesses. This winter was so tough on people who were involved in the construction side, whether that was residential or light commercial that they saw whole weeks that they missed in terms of being able to get on job sites. As a result, they were really careful with their inventories. So we do not think the inventories are overstocked on the electrical side, and I think as we're starting to see ground opening up, people being able to get going that we think -- that we're in that kind of normal seasonal pop-up at this point. And perhaps in some of the areas of the country like the northeast for example that really had a very difficult winter, we'll see them rebound a little bit more strongly, but I would say I think it's a plus at this point, not a neutral. Don Bullock : Our next question comes from John Inch with Deutsche Bank. John Inch - Deutsche Bank : Hi, Sandy. The restructuring in the second quarter, it just seems a little unusual in terms of the timing. I hear your macro commentary, but I'm trying to dovetail that with the fact that you obviously saw April rebound, right? It sounds like Cooper is on track. What exactly is out there that would cause you in the second quarter to kind of pull forward some cost saves? Is it \u2013 I mean, I'm just trying to understand the timing, that's all. Sandy Cutler : Yes, I wouldn't say there is anything unusual about our timing, John. We take these actions when we think it's right within our businesses and we've done the right preparation, and that always takes some time, and frankly, we're not all the way through them, which is why we're not sharing them in terms of how much is in each individual business, what we'll get there as we roll them all out. But as we watch the first quarter unfold in terms of what I call some of the global GDP issues that's really what caused us to believe this was the right time to move ahead on them. Frankly, if we'd seen the world sort of taking off and I'd call, less of the growth anxiety, these may or may not have been the right thing to do. So we think it's just a very prudent hedge against the likelihood that we see weakness pop out in any of these markets. So we've not changed our own view of the 3% growth. Frankly, a number of you felt we were too somber in our 3% for this year. We still think that's about the right number because the world does have -- I call it, growth anxieties right now. John Inch - Deutsche Bank : Yes that makes sense. But the hedge, just so I'm clear, right, the hedge sounds like, it's because -- this isn't sort of cadencing to your internal plan, like, I mean, I'm trying to understand, did you expect, for instance, April is obviously rebounded, but did you expect it to be rebounded even more? Are there things you're seeing perhaps, and -- obviously we know what's happening in emerging markets and then there's the question mark around Europe. I'm just making sure there's nothing else. Sandy Cutler : No, nothing else, John, really, just our kind of sense that that the world is probably not going to accelerate substantially beyond the numbers that we've got out there at this point. And we think that these plans, as our businesses, have reviewed them with us, make really good sense and all they do is make our businesses more competitive, and also give us, I think a stronger self-help earnings story, obviously as we go into 2015. So I think a net plus all round from the very, very fast paybacks, as you can see roughly a $35 million payback next year for the $40 million this year. And so they are very attractive programs. John Inch - Deutsche Bank : Yes. It looks like the street including ourselves kind of mismodeled the second quarter a little bit. So the first half based on the midpoint, right, is going to be above 45% of the year based on the midpoint. Historically, you've had a bit of a stronger first half. Is that what you would expect, Sandy, Rick, going forward that your first half is about that, again, kind of pro forma for Cooper et cetera, is that about right, and maybe we just mismodeled it or is there something else about sort of the sequential that you think we should be thinking about? Sandy Cutler : No, I don't think there is something else John. I think that frankly and we're aware that the consensus was up in the high 120s for the second quarter. Frankly that looks too strong to us. It is true that we tend to have our strongest quarters in the second, third, and fourth quarters. But this year was having obviously a $0.08 share that put you up at a $1.18, and so on adjusted basis if you would add that to our $1.10 midpoint. And -- it's again we're tracking toward a $4.70 guidance. I know the consensus is out there, it's been a little bit north of $4.80, and I suspect that difference got swapped into the second quarter. We obviously don't know what's behind everybody's individual thinking, but I think that balance if you say first half and second half is -- that's reflected in our guidance, this point is a pretty good way to think about an average year for Eaton. John Inch - Deutsche Bank : Yes that makes sense. Then just lastly, this is the year of Cooper integration I guess with respect to facilities, manufacturing, distribution, heavy emphasis on Europe. How are you guys feeling sort of four, five months in the year sort of under our belt, what's the trajectory and what is the point like has everything gone okay in Europe? I realize you spent a little bit less money, but that's obviously one of those things where you sit here in North America and Egypt -- you hear all these headlines about you can't do anything in France et cetera so what -- how is the progress been, any kind of an update would be helpful? Sandy Cutler : Yes, I'm going to appreciate the question because it is a very important activity that our teams are involved and where we are really very pleased, whether it be the overall activity and you're right, this is the belly of the beast if you will, the 2014 and '15 are the really heavy lifting years of execution, and the teams are really doing it, I'm just very, very pleased. Specifically in Europe, we are through all of the planning phases, and we're into the action phase. And so that as you say, the fact that it always takes a little longer to get things done in Europe, we think we did a very good job of planning, communicating, and we're now in the execution phase. So we're in the action phase and it's moving ahead very well. So if anything, I think we're moving a little faster than we had originally anticipated, and that's good news. I would say as important as are all the cost synergies, the area I'm equally really thrilled about is, is how well the reception is going in terms of the marketplace with our improved competitive position and the synergy opportunities. And you really saw that come through in terms of that very strong organic growth in the Products segment, in spite of the weather problems that were out there. You can see that our organic growth overall for our electrical business of about 2.9% or 3%, really fared pretty well when you look at many of the other global competitors. And we think that's a testimony to how well this is coming together. Don Bullock : Our next question comes from Ann Duignan with JPMorgan. Ann Duignan - JPMorgan: Sandy, can you give us some color on your bookings within the different segments? Normally you give us how much mobile bookings were up distribution, et cetera, et cetera, just in the different businesses if you have any more color. Sandy Cutler : Sure. Now, I think, let me start with the one you just referred to, Hydraulics is that, in a little bit of a change for us. In this quarter where you've been seeing over the last six to nine months that our mobile bookings have actually been stronger than our stationary, this time mobile was up 7% and stationary was up 41%. Now that huge 41% gives you a feel for what's going on in the oil and gas industry and that was the biggest push. Within mobile, as I mentioned, the construction was very strongly, and then the negative, as you would expect would be mining and then we saw ag being slightly negative as well. If you flip it and look at it from a distribution and an OEM point of view because a bunch of -- most in the mobile and in many of the big oil and gas activities are what I would call OEM-oriented, there again, it was heavily more OEM than it was distributor-oriented this particular quarter. If I flip you over to aerospace for a moment, the overall bookings of two, and remember, we had very strong bookings the last quarter, so we don't average ours on a rolling average. We just give them to you as individual quarter. This was really a situation where you had all the great commercial strength being offset by defense weakness, and then I mentioned on the aftermarket side that the commercial was very strong but the military was also a very healthy positive. So a nice balance there. And then if you go back up into the electrical businesses, I think the comments you've heard from other electrical companies, I wouldn't typify the market much different. I'd say there's been improvement in construction markets. Oil and gas is strong. We had a very, very strong quarter in terms of lighting, high double-digits. We had high double-digit on bookings in the residential segments as well. The weakness, as I mentioned was in the U.S. large gear and large UPS, the big UPS market was weaker in the first quarter, and then the Canadian economy has been weaker as I think you've seen with most people. In Europe, we've been really pleased with the single-high-digit recovery in our comp on the product lines, virtually across Europe and the Middle East, and better strength in the small data center area and the large data center area. And then when you go to Asia-Pacific, which was the more challenging region outside of the weather issue that hit North America. There you've got some very strong activity and large data center activity, some pretty good attractive large project work in the power distribution side, but the weaker side of the markets have been the single phase power quality markets, and then the Australian economy continues to be weak. I mean, overall for Eaton, let me just anticipate the China question, we saw our revenues in the first quarter in China up 10%, and so I think China continues to improve at this point, and I think that's good news, because one of the questions we've all had is how quick would that recovery be. That's the one area the world of construction equipment market has not recovered and so this big driver on construction equipment has been primarily a U.S., a Europe, a weak South America and a not recovered China yet. Ann Duignan - JPMorgan: Okay. And that's a great color thank you, appreciate it. And just a follow-up on Brazil, you noted that market. And could you just breakout you different business segments in Brazil, whether it's ag-related or truck or automotive? Sandy Cutler : Again, overall for our Vehicle Latin America view, when we last gave guidance, we thought the markets for the full year would be down on the order of 2. We think it is more likely that they're going to be down on the order of 4. In the first quarter and we've got some question always about the accuracy of quarterly data stream. So take this with a little bit of salt, if you will. We think it probably is down on the order of 6, and within that you saw Brazilian ag being the bigger number certainly down somewhere between 10% and 15% in the first quarter with the light vehicle markets being down something just below 10%. And then the truck and bus numbers look to have been down just a couple of percent. So somewhere in those ranges when you try to get the overall feel for the market. Don Bullock : Our next question comes from Steve Winoker with Sanford Bernstein. Steve Winoker - Sanford Bernstein : Just to put a finer point on the Cooper cost synergies, you had moved to $5 million I guess out to 2014. Have these specific actions now taken place in the last quarter so that that catch-up is or that's cleared -- is it complete clarity on that or is it still to be done? Sandy Cutler : We have things that we'll do all through the year this year, but we've not changed what -- and I think as Tom outlined for everyone who had the chance to -- Tom Trowse identify for everyone had the chance to attend our meeting in New York, he tried to give you an indication, about each of the categories via the cost or the synergy sales categories. The vast majorities of decisions have been made, and so we're in an executing mode. So I would say no, there has not been a change in either scope of what we're taking on nor schedule. And we feel, we're now, three-and-a-half months or almost four months into this year, and it continues to feel very good in that regard. Steve Winoker - Sanford Bernstein : And Sandy, do you have a sense for upside from there as you continue to sort of, now that you continue to make progress, from your end you kind of talked about a high level, you feel good. I mean do you -- are you starting to find new areas of opportunities without -- you don't need to quantify it, but are you getting a sense for even more there on the cost side? Sandy Cutler : I think we'll get a better sense, I think as we've got a very full place and what we're working today. And I think there are always more opportunities. The question is will they prioritize high enough that we'll get at them during this very focused two, three years of execution. So I wouldn't want to advertise as we've got excess capacity to take things on right now. We're pretty busy. There's a lot going on. I think the team is doing well, and we get out towards the end of this year, we'll have another projection as to whether we think it steps up from there. But you'll recall, we just increased in February what we thought not much would happen so much this year, but what would happen over the '15, '16 time period, and I don't anticipate that we're going to be raising a lot during '14. I think the potential would be out there in the future, and we'll look at that as we get towards the end of this year. Steve Winoker - Sanford Bernstein : And just so I understand that ESS commentary on mix, weather, and corporate allocation, to sort of say that you're on similar on what you would expected, and I guess that's two-tenths or 20 basis points for corporate. That allocation, year-on-year, you've would done it before, just how -- what kinds of things are we talking about there? I know it's small, but I'm just trying to get a sense of the health of the business. Sandy Cutler : It's a whole -- no, it's -- these are areas where we have services or assets that support both the segments, and as we've just looked at you can almost think of it as an activity costing model. We've simply just said, we think that about $4 million more per quarter should have been assessed against the ESS segment and the Products segment. So nothing that affects the health of the business or the orders or the competitiveness, it's really an internal cost allocation issue. And once we came to this determination during the first quarter, we thought we were better to kind of project it out over the whole year, and that's why we increased the segment margin target for the full year in products by 0.25 and took it down by 0.25 in in the Systems and Services. Steve Winoker - Sanford Bernstein : Right. And you're not seeing any pricing pressure in the electrical businesses, are you? Sandy Cutler : Well, I would say that in every business, there are always pricing pressures, but no, I'd say at this point, we're comfortable with our margin projections vis-\u00e0-vis all the cost reduction work and new product introduction we do as well. Don Bullock : Next question comes from Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc. Jeff Hammond - KeyBanc: Just on ESS, I mean outside of may be the weather and some of the timing noise, can you just characterize what you are seeing in those project related power quality, power distribution outside of may be what your expectations were and just tone there? Sandy Cutler : I think the big issue Jeff and then I will come on a couple of specific areas was, just as the weather got worse this winter and you saw an awful lot of job sites frozen out, so a lot of things didn't start and they were people also delaying either the quotation or the awarding of large projects with a pretty unusual quarter in terms of the number of large projects that were actually awarded and we're able to track that data pretty carefully, because we've got such a good window. And I'm speaking primarily here about the North American impact. I'd say the second issue, comment a little bit in response to Ann's question earlier is that the -- if you look at the large data center side of the market, in the U.S. it was a pretty weak quarter in terms of data centers wanting to receive their equipment. Now we see just the opposite happening in the second half of this year, where the schedules for the second half look pretty robust with what we've got in hand at this point. So I think those are just examples of, because there are always hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of these projects, not just one project. But we're feeling much better about as we see this fill for the second quarter and the balance of the year, a very unusual first quarter and our experience in that regard. Jeff Hammond - KeyBanc: Okay. Then just remind us on this synergy split between EPG and ESS. Why that is, what's driving it in terms of the actions and the savings timing and does that start to shift into '15? Sandy Cutler : Yes, at this point what we had said is, if you take the roughly $95 million of year-to-year, that was 2013 to 2014 acquisition synergies and that consisted both of sales synergies and cost synergies. And you remember that we said that about $8 million of that shows up from the corporate line, so you got about $87 million that then shows up into the two segments that approximately 75% of that would show up in the products segment and approximately 25% in the S&S or ESS segment. That's indeed what it looks like is pretty well happening and it has to do specifically with the mix of all of the projects. We've not yet looked at that for 2015 and laid it out over the two segments precisely, we'll do that as we get to later this year. It's many, many, many, many projects if you could imagine. But right now I think that's a pretty good planning template for you to be using for this year. Don Bullock : Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research : Couple of quick ones. Sandy, just your view on restructuring to come back around to that. So you could kind of say in essence you've taken and make it into restructuring here and you too running it through kind of your operating number. How do you think about that relative to gains, I mean the essence of my question is you'll have a gain on the aerospace stuff? Do you view that as an opportunity to fund some additional restructuring, do you view those type items kind of in the same sentence, if you will, or they're totally kind of discrete factors for you? Sandy Cutler : We've not -- obviously we've not included in our $4.70 midpoint operating earnings per share guidance any gain from our announced divestiture to Safran of our two aerospace units. At the time that we close that transaction, we'll be in a position to talk a little bit about what that gain would be and we do expect to close it in the second quarter. I think it's just premature for us to comment, until we close it, Jeff, at this point. At this point, we want to be very transparent about the -- taking the charge this year, its $0.08. Some people will interpret that that we've raised our guidance by $0.08 because we've obviously kept a $4.70 operating earnings per share midpoint, and we didn't have the $0.08 in that beforehand. And then we want you to have visibility to what we think the benefit is for 2015, because I think increasingly in these periods of relatively slow end market growth and I would characterize 3% as still in the relatively slow area, we think it's increasingly important that the self-help story, if you will, would accompany this as a really powerful part of the earnings story. And with a $185 million of self-help going into next year, we think that's pretty powerful. Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research : Thank you. And just two other quick ones, could you comment briefly on what you see going on specifically in the U.S. utility market on the distribution side, putting aside kind of the weather noise, but how the year plays out in your view? And then I was just wondering on tax, because the modest change this year in anyway change your view where tax rate had been, '15 and in the out-years? Sandy Cutler : On utilities, Jeff, really, no different than what our original guidance was this year. We had said we thought the market would be flattish from last year to this year, that's still our view. I think the first quarter was rougher on some utilities and others depending on where they were weather-wise. And obviously, some areas got pretty beat up in terms of distribution. But we don't see it as being substantially different. We think overall, it's likely to be a flat year, and that's pretty much what we're hearing back from our customers in this regard. And on the tax rate, our guidance for this year remains around 5%. So really no change. And as I mentioned, in terms of the guidance for the second quarter, we feel it will have trended up slightly from where we are in the first quarter, and it's probably likely to be a little bit north of the 5%, because we were a little bit south of it in the first quarter. Rick Fearon : And Jeff, that keeps our view for '15 at the 8% to 10% range that we talked about on our last earnings call. Don Bullock : Our next question comes from Shannon O'Callaghan with Nomura. Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura: So Sandy may be a little bit more on the booking for ESS, you mentioned and we've had sort of two straight down quarters of bookings. We're talking about more robust data center activity in the second half. Is that sort of when maybe we finally turn the corner back into positive bookings for ESS? Just a little color on what you see coming in the pipeline. Sandy Cutler : I would say data centers Shannon is just one part of it. It's -- the data center clearly, the big end data centers, the three phases as we call them, that is in this particular segment and we do see better activity in fact, we're pretty confident of their much better activity in the second half. But I'd say, the other bigger potion is the Canadian markets have been quite weak coming out of the backend of last year versus a year ago, and it was true in the first quarter. And as I mentioned, I think it was Jeff's question relative to the -- what was unusual about this first quarter was that, we had really huge bookings in the fourth quarter of 2012 and first quarter of '13. That compounded the fact that when we saw this quarter and the first quarter of 2014 with very few big bookings, and I'm talking about these are over a certain dollar size. The market really just kind of pulls back in terms of actually placing those orders and you see it in the NEMA data, the National Electrical Manufacturers Association's data, quite a different first quarter. We think that was very much related to not only the fact that people lost workdays, but that there were so many job sites frozen out, that people just were waiting. Now, we're seeing that in terms of, I mentioned in my comments at the beginning of the call, we're seeing that in April because it has definitively changed in terms of this larger activities. So no, it's not simply power quality, it's on the power distribution side as well. Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura: And I guess on the margin side for ESS, I mean even if you add back the factors you called out for the quarter, margins didn't go up much this quarter, when do you think you really start to transition into the margin improvement phase, for ESS obviously, it's baked into the '15 number, but as we phase sort of across the quarters, when do you think you really kind of turn the corner? Sandy Cutler : Well clearly, it has to step up in the second quarter in order for us to be able to hit this 14.5% guidance we've provided for the full year. So we don't think this takes a long time to be addressed. Don Bullock : Our next question comes from Eli Lustgarten with Longbow. Eli Lustgarten - Longbow: Can we talk a little bit about the first half, second half, I mean it's obviously, most of you were disappointed with that second quarter guidance well below our modeling, which probably got wrong. But in order to make your numbers, we're talking a step-up of the earnings now to at least $1.30 kind of the quarter in the second half. And can you run us conceptually, what takes us up that much between the first half and second half? Do you have that booking or the expectations of power quality, what's driving that profile, big profile step-up in the second half versus first half? Sandy Cutler : The first part Eli, if you take your $1.10 in the second quarter, add $0.08 for the restructuring, so the actual run rate without restructuring is $1.18. So to hop yourself up to $1.30 would be a 10% increase. When you typically look back at our company, the difference between seconds and thirds, that's not an unusual number and we're obviously also the synergies continue to increase in this time period, and we do expect the segment I just talked about, Electrical Systems and Services those margins will get better. You'll also see I think the earlier point we made on aerospace that aerospace started this first quarter 13.4% and we're talking about a full year margin there that are at 14%. And then I wouldn't ignore the vehicle piece because on top of the traditional seasonal in vehicle, we have seen obviously the bookings get stronger around North American heavy duty in the industry, and there's a fairly attractive step-up occurring as we get into this year. So I think those would be your major factors in this regard. Now, also, if you look at our corporate areas of interest in pension, they start to trend down as you go across this year as well. So those would be the major points I would point to. Eli Lustgarten - Longbow: So, it's just a normal -- this is nothing businesswise, backlog in shipping or anything, that gives you this expectation from a macro standpoint, and how you're running the business internally? Sandy Cutler : No, we think it will be a fairly normal progression ex the $0.08 that was hitting this quarter, and that makes it look like you're jumping from $1.10 to some quarters that would be like a $1, $1.30 and it's the $0.08, when you put in there, I think it makes it feel like it's not that kind of jump. Eli Lustgarten - Longbow: And you talked probably about the industrial restructuring, but I guess you never were specific about where it is, is that pretty well spread across or it's mostly in one segment? Can you give us some idea of exactly what you're trying to doing that (inaudible)? Sandy Cutler : Until we're announced with all of our employees, we're not in a position to do that. After we have finished all of that, then we'll be in a position to be able to do that. Eli Lustgarten - Longbow: Yes. But is it spread or is it more focused? Sandy Cutler : It's in all three elements of what we call industrial sector. So it's in Hydraulics, it's in Aerospace and it's in Vehicle. Don Bullock : Our next question comes from Andy Casey with Wells Fargo. Andy Casey - Wells Fargo : Just a kind of a high-level question first. When you look at what you're seeing across markets and axing out the Q1 weather impact for a moment, are you more or less confident in a pick-up in improved U.S. CapEx from your customers and commercial construction during 2014 than you were when you put together the initial forecast towards the end of last year? Sandy Cutler : Well I think you have to be more confident just because the numbers that are available from the Department of Commerce would indicate that the first quarter was 7.5% and so our guidance of 7% to 8% doesn't sound like it's very wild when the first quarter came in at 7.5%. And it's a bigger number on the private put in place, it's a negative number on the government, but I think again some of the input you heard from various companies who have announced, I think they are looking at just individual elements of the non-residential and not looking at that whole chart that we referred people to historically. Andy Casey - Wells Fargo : Okay. So if we look at that Sandy and take into account the stronger March/April customer activity that you referred to, do you think the April improvement is just catch-up to where you thought you would be, or is it potential upside? Sandy Cutler : I wouldn't raise our forecast right now. I think that it's really an indication on these larger projects that there was some push out and awards in the first quarter. I think we'll have a better sense Andy, when we get through a full quarter of seeing how that stabilizes over in April, May, June. So I think it's a little bit early to call that it's going higher than 7 to 8. And remember our number is a nominal number, you'll hear some people talking real numbers and ours is nominal just to be clear in that regard. Andy Casey - Wells Fargo : Okay and thanks for that. And then lastly on that April project activity improvement. What -- if everything holds, what sort of revenue recognition lag would you expect based on the projects that you're seeing come in? Sandy Cutler : Boy, it can vary, Andy, from a month to three to five months. We have a very hefty backlog, so we're kind of well covered in the near-term in that regard. But I think importantly from a tone point of view when you look at the difference between the bookings in our Electrical Products segment and our Electrical S&S segment, it's hard to reconcile the two that you're up a plus 6% on the distributor side, but the project side didn't really come through that's where that the difference in terms of, there is some end market difference such as big data centers, but an awful lot of it goes into light and bigger commercial construction and we think that's the piece that we'll see filling in here in the second quarter. Don Bullock : Next question comes from Joe Ritchie, Goldman Sachs. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs : Just a few quick questions. Sandy, can quantify, it seems like you've been pretty happy with how April has started. Can you quantify what electrical bookings are up in April? Sandy Cutler : Since we haven't closed the month we really don't have a final number, but they feel a lot more across-the-board like what we saw in products for the first segment. So in both segments, whether it's the S&S, or whether it's the products side. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs : Just to clarify there, it seems like what products is trending towards in Q1? Sandy Cutler : Yes. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs : Okay helpful. And then, secondly, does the incremental restructuring that you've talked about for Q2 and the incremental savings in '15 give you any upside to that preliminary 17% margin target that you've talked about before? Sandy Cutler : No, I wouldn't change them now. I would really -- we will obviously -- we will have to go through our planning at the end of the year. But I would say, I think it just gives additional credence to them at this point in spite of the slow growth environment. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs : And you guys have been pretty good at calling the truck order number. Is there a preliminary read on April? Sandy Cutler : We don't have a final number. What we're hearing from customers though is that we think it's going to be let's say, a very attractive number, again, looking like this kind of trend we've seen over the last four months. There's really good tone and activity out there. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs : Okay. That's helpful. I guess one last question on the Hydraulics side of your business. It was interesting to hear that your mobile was up, I guess outside of China. Do you have any sense how much of that is underlying demand today versus just a restock of the channel? Sandy Cutler : We do believe in Europe and in the U.S. that the channels are in pretty good shape. We've talked a lot about this over the last couple of years that that adjustment is going on. I think you've heard from at least one of the big OEMs that they are starting to do restock into their channel and that's all helped the opposite of that is the situation in China today where I think there is more and more recognition that that channel is very full, and that the utilization rate of newer equipment sold over the last couple of years is still fairly low. So I think most people in the industry are thinking that things are looking up in the U.S. and Europe. There are kind of sideways in South America, the way you've got more of a mining orientation, same true in Australia and that China is the area that's harder one to figure out, looks like it's off in the future some time. Don Bullock : We'll be able to take one more question and then as normal, we will be available after to follow-up questions. Our next question is from Mig Dobre with Baird. Mig Dobre - Robert W. Baird: Thanks for squeezing me in. Going back to Hydraulics here, you reiterated your 2014 margin guidance, and I'm looking at what obviously was a very good first quarter. I'm wondering how should we be thinking about incrementals for the rest of the year here? Sandy Cutler : Mig, normally our Hydraulics business like a number of our industrial segment business -- sector businesses have stronger first half than they do second half. And so I'd say that's probably may be the best guidance I can give you in that regard both from a volume point of view and then obviously the margins as well. So we're pleased, we've started stronger as we should have in terms of achieving this margin. We'll take a look at the full year projections as we get to mid-year. But I think I'd put another category we're off to good start. We're very much on schedule and we're particularly pleased not only with the 240 basis point increase in the margin, but with the continued very strong bookings background, because that's what's going to give the ability really to power this business up further from a revenue point of view. Mig Dobre - Robert W. Baird: Sure, I appreciate the color. And my last question is really on your guidance. As you sort of look at the earnings guidance range and assuming the midpoint may be as the base case, what do you think you could have some of the upside and downside risk at segment level, may be that could take you to either the high-end or the low-end of your guidance? Sandy Cutler : What we've said is the big issue and we said this back when we issued our original guidance. If you model the 2% to 4% growth rate in our end markets you get the two wings of our guidance. The 3% is really the midpoint of our guidance. So I think the big plus or minus really has to do how we see these world markets for our end markets. So at this point 3% still looks like our best view. Mig Dobre - Robert W. Baird: But you wouldn't call out a specific segment for upside or downside risk, specifically? Sandy Cutler : No, I think we're very comfortable with where we are from an execution point of view. A lot of it's going to deal with just how strong these markets play out for the balance of the year. Don Bullock : Thank you all for joining us today. As always, I'll be available for follow-up questions along with Mark Doheny. Thank you again, and we look forward to your follow-up questions. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using the AT&T Executive Teleconferencing Service. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions) And as a remainder, this call is being recorded. I\u2019d now like to turn the conference over to Don Bullock. Please go ahead. Donald H. Bullock:  Good morning. I\u2019m Don Bullock, Eaton\u2019s Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Welcome to Eaton's second quarter 2014 earnings conference call. Joining me this morning are Sandy Cutler, Chairman and CEO; and Rick Fearon, Vice Chairman and CFO. As has been our historical practice, we will begin today's call with comments from Sandy, followed by a question-and-answer session. Before we move to that, I\u2019ll take a moment to draw your attention to the materials on page 2 of the presentation on our website, regarding certain forward-looking statements. The comments included on page 2 in the presentation, outline a series of factors that could cause actual results to differ from what we presented in these statements. These factors are also noted in today's press release and the related Form 8-K. In addition, our presentation today includes certain non-GAAP measures as defined by the SEC rules. A reconciliation of all of those measures to the most directly comparable GAAP equivalent is provided in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.eaton.com. At this point, I\u2019ll turn it over to Sandy. Sandy Cutler :  Great, thanks Don. I'm going to work from the presentation, which was posted earlier this morning and I\u2019m going to start on page number 3, which is entitled highlights of the second quarter results. I would say a pretty busy quarter. We released that 8-K, a week ago, detailing the interaction of the several special or unusual items that we had in the quarter being the text of the gain on the sale of the aerospace business and our several legal settlements. At that point, we indicated we expected that our operating earnings per share would be in the $1.10 to $1.12 range and we\u2019re pleased this morning they came in right in the middle of that range, but that were $1.11 above the original guidance that we gave when we began this quarter. Our sales were right on the button. We\u2019ve said they would be up 5% compared to the first quarter than they were and our margins were very much in line with our expectations. And you recall it when we gave you margin guidance for this quarter that was before the $0.08 of restructuring that we took in the industrial sector. So I will detail how that affects the full-year margin guidelines for each of those segments as we go on this morning. Strong industrial sector, strong electrical product margins offset the weakness in the electrical systems and services margins. I will talk a little bit more specifically about electrical systems and services but the company really allowed us to command very much in line as I mentioned with our own expectations. Very strong bookings in electrical overall in both of the two segments report, obviously in aerospace as well. We also raised our guidance in terms of where we think the markets will be for that NAFTA heavy-duty truck businesses for 290,000, so a pretty good market activity in that respect. And in our integration of the Cooper acquisition, I will talk a little bit of a more of that stays a very much on track at this point. If we move to the chart number 4, just quickly a summary of the impact of really several unusual items in the second quarter. If you recall the acquisition integration charges show up on two lines on our P&L, they have to show up both in the segments for about $30 million of the overall $37 million of expense that\u2019s shown and about $7 million at the corporate level. Then you could see obviously the subject that we released 8-K on last week, the Meritor litigation, the Triumph litigation, the associated legal cost and then the benefits that came from aerospace business divestitures in total after-tax impact of about $0.70 and that\u2019s how you get from the $0.41 operating earnings per share reported through the operating EPS excluding these unusual items. We know what the interplay of all of these elements that makes following the tax line, particularly challenging in this quarter, so we try to provide a breakout from the tax rate as reported and obviously a very large negative income as a result of these litigation settlements that took place in the U.S. at obviously the high U.S. rate. You can see the tax rate excluding all of the unusual items was about 8%, a little higher than we\u2019ve been running and reflective of the fact that our mix of business has been a little stronger in the U.S. than it has been outside the U.S. I think a good reflection of a staffing in the global economy where generally the U.S. is one of the stronger regions at this point. And the weakness that we\u2019ve seen in our end-markets tends to be primarily in the markets outside of the U.S. If we move to the page 5, once again, a quarter very much in line with our own expectations. Sales and margins, as I expected, slightly lower corporate expenses and offset the slightly higher \u2013 higher taxes as you can see a simply one set net of those two items and that led to the $1.11. If we move to page 6, this is the overall financial summary. I think the one number I would want to comment on here is that if you remember our first quarter shipment number was $5.492 billion, so when you look at the $5.767 that\u2019s exactly a 5% that\u2019s what we have had thought we would see in terms of the growth in the second quarter from the first quarter. Overall, again, then if you look at the segment operating margin at 14.6 when you adjust for the $0.08 of restructuring that we told you would occur and this quarter would be $15.3 come back and maybe amplify now as we go through each of the individual segments. But overall core growth of 3%, if you recall, we had core growth of just slightly over 4% in the first quarter. A little stronger year-to-year market activity in the first quarter really happened in terms of the hydraulics market and the vehicle markets, which were not as much of an increase year-over-year when you look at the second quarter and versus the second quarter of last year. Now let\u2019s move to chart number 7, which is entitled electrical products segment. Here again, about 6% growth from the first quarter where we had revenues of $1.726, up about 4% year-over-year. I think again a very good news here in bookings, you will hear this both in the electrical products and the electrical systems and services where we saw overall bookings up some 8% in the Americas, 8% in Asia-Pacific, and then obviously the area that we\u2019ve talked about of less strength is pretty flattish condition still in the European region. Again, we just call out here that what\u2019s going on in terms of the LED lighting change in our business 41% of the overall sales now quite strong, obviously as we\u2019re continuing to introduce a lot of new products in that particular area. And when you get within the three regions on my comments, just on a couple areas, that the end market strength that maybe helpful for you to understand. I\u2019d mentioned lighting is obviously quite strong, residential has continued to be strong for us. Overall distributor demand what we\u2019re seeing here in this electrical products segment has been strong. The weak area has been the power quality market. And then the electrical product segments is where we report of the single phase side of that marketplace, actual negative growth in that marketplace continues to be quite weak. In EMEA, the strength continues to be really a story of weak in the continents, strong in the Middle East in portions of Africa. In Asia-Pacific, recovering strength, broadly in our components, which we\u2019re very pleased about weakness and the single phase power quality continues to parallel what we\u2019re seeing here in the U.S. and then we\u2019ve seen Australia where the economy continue to be quite weak there. If we move to page 8, which is electrical systems and services segment, a couple of highlight comments here is that first sales up about 7% compared to the first quarter, when it was $1.524 billion. If you look versus last year, pretty flat, and that really reflects these slow bookings that we had. If you recall, we had a decline in bookings in the first quarter, a number of you had asked questions at that time, would that have a (indiscernible) into the next quarter because generally you have more of a backlog in this particular segment, where you don\u2019t have a backlog in the products segment. Margins, obviously, a 12.7% pretty flat with the first quarter and down 200 basis points from last year, I\u2019ll comment on that in just a minute, if I could just comment on bookings first. Bookings, again, up 7% as the strongest in some six quarters. If you remember the later three quarters of last year where we actually had a negative quarter and the fourth quarter, negative quarter, and the first quarter we\u2019re very pleased with the substantial reversal here. The strength, as I mentioned from a regional point of view, is pretty much as I mentioned for the products area. Here we\u2019re seeing good strength. Canada has strengthened which you have probably heard from a number of competitors in this marketplace, but good activity across most of our products here with the exception of the large and of the power quality market. So again a common seeing that power quality is weaker than we\u2019re seeing on the power distribution side of the business, again weaker in Europe, stronger in Asia-Pacific and Americas. We talked a little bit about the margin issue. If you recall it, we had weaker margins in the first quarter and we had about $13 million that we detailed for you in the first that dealt with a lot of the weather related expediting cost we had in the business. Different situation here in the second quarter and we really rolled it out into our full year guidance for the segment. I\u2019ll talk more about that when we get back to the page a little further in the packets here, but we really saw higher logistics costs and some unfavorable mix and this is a business where it is a mix of many, many different projects and some more competitive pricing in the segment. We believe the second half will be stronger than the first half, you see that in our guidance. We have some view into that as a result of the backlog that we now have on hand with obviously a very substantial booking quarter here. But we do believe that some of the logistics costs and the unfavorable mix are likely to be with us as how we\u2019re seeing the market materializes here. The particular location of where those challenges really are is it\u2019s in the large power distribution and power quality assemblies where they are more competitive in terms of the pricing environment than they were a year ago. Those unfortunately did offset the synergies that we did get in this segment, so we\u2018re confident about the overall synergies we\u2019re getting both in the electrical products, the electrical systems and services and at the corporate level, but we did have some negatives as we tried to detail here pretty clearly in terms of the impact upon margin. If we move to the Hydraulics segment, this is page 9. Up just a 1% from the first quarter, first quarter was $782 million of shipments, up 2% from last year. The second quarter bookings being down by 2%, I think it surprise some people, but if you recall that we\u2019ve seen a fairly substantial increase in bookings for the last three quarters and it is leveling at this point. And we really pointed two key elements. One I think is where both should not really be a surprise. First is the global agricultural equipment market seems to have gone over top. We\u2019re seeing most OEMs talking being down in the 5% to 10% range this year. And then the China construction equipment market continues to be very weak as you have heard from a number of OEMs who come into that and over the last month or so, we don\u2019t see that turning around here in the year of 2014. As a result, we\u2019ve reduced the market forecast down for the full-year from approximately 3% to 1% and the real issues you think about it is the U.S. is likely to be sort of a plus 2, the rest of the world is sort of a 0 really brought down by the large construction markets in China. When we look within our own bookings, the distributor side of the business up in the order of 9%, the OEM side of business down in the order of some 15% basically for the reasons I mentioned was the mobile market have been hit by this construction and ag weakness. And you recall that this was one of the three segments that we said that we were going to take some restructuring expense. During the second quarter, you will see in that first bullet point in the yellow section of the yellow box, it was about 160 basis points without that this margin is pretty much as it was a year ago about 14.2%. If we move to chart 10, which is the aerospace segment up volumes some 5% from the first quarter, when it was $464 million up 9% from a year ago. As you could see, we still have some small impact in this segment from the two small aerospace business units, we divested in the second quarter, but you could see the bookings up very strongly and we\u2019re really quite pleased with a 20% increase in aftermarket orders on both \u2013 the good strong activity on both the commercial and the military side of the business. Once again, restructuring costs taken in this business, during the second quarter, reduced margins by about 40 basis points, so again margin is pretty similar to 14.6% without the restructuring expense. Turning to page 11, the vehicle segment, first quarter shipments were about $996 million, so shipments from the second quarter up about 4%, up 3% from last year. Again after some large restructuring costs in this segment that we have said we were taking at the beginning of the first quarter, they would come up for about 230 basis points decrease in margin. So margins would have been 17.3%, so a very healthy level in the segment. Without those as we watched the June NAFTA orders coming in at almost 27 million units for heavy-duty trucks and now that whole second quarter at about 78,000 units. We\u2019ve raised our guidance for this segment for the NAFTA heavy-duty truck build to 290,000 units, coming out of this quarter at about 74,000 units build. It\u2019s a pretty flat forecast for the rest of the year. And, so we think lower than the sweet spot here. The offset for that is the South American markets continue to be very weak and we think are down on the order overall of about 11%, so pretty weak activities down in South America. If we turn to chat, well really just one change in terms of our overall end-market growth, it is still 3% for the company, the change within hydraulics was not enough to kind of swing the total number and again that change in Hydraulics is the global ag market and then the construction equipment in China weaker than we have thought. If we move to page 13, I\u2019d like to spend a couple of minutes on this chart today because I think it\u2019s important in being sure that we\u2019re all in the same page in terms of our margin expectations. If you recall when we gave margin expectations by segment at the end of the first quarter, we noted that that margin guidance did not include the then expected $40 million restructuring and as it turned out in our actuals, you saw $39 million of restructuring actually took place in the third quarter in our Hydraulics, Aerospace and Vehicle businesses. We are now taking those restructuring costs which were already in our earnings guidance for the year and simply reflecting them in the individual segments. If you recall, we did not do that at the time we shared the $40 million restructuring plan because we\u2019ve not made an announcements to our employees yet and until we did so, we did not want to reflect it in the segments. As a result, if I can start with Hydraulics, the Hydraulics $13 million restructuring was four tenths of 1% that explains the difference between the 13.5 and 13 revised guidance. In Aerospace, the $2 million of restructuring small enough it didn\u2019t really affect our 14% guidance that we had before in hand. In Vehicle, the $24 million of restructuring is 6 tenths of 1% and that\u2019s why we\u2019ve reduced from 16 to 15.5. So really no change in our underline guidance of margin for those three business segments. Now let me go back up to electrical systems and services where we decreased from 14.5% to 13.5%. If you recall in the first quarter, we had about $13 of weather related variances. Second quarter is I detailed earlier the next logistics and pricing impact that\u2019s why we\u2019ve taken a point (indiscernible) margins, obviously with having been under 13% in the first two quarters of the year for us to be really we\u2019re going to achieve 13.5 for the full year. We are anticipating the second half being stronger and as I mentioned with larger backlog we have and the knowledge of what\u2019s in our backlog, we feel comfortable with those projections for the balance of the year, but we are taking the full year down by a point at this point. Now when you get to the bottom, the Eaton\u2019s consolidated number of 15.2% versus the 15.7% previously, the $39 million of restructuring expenses is worth 2 tenths of 1%. The electrical system and services segment\u2019s impact on the total company is 3 tenths and that\u2019s the difference of the 5 tenths. Hopefully that clarifies for you at somewhat of a complex set of numbers in terms of the margins, but really you can trace from those two sets of actions. Moving to page 14, this is our full year guidance. We did lower the top-end of our guidance due to the change of margin outlook in Electrical Systems and Services and the fact that you recall when we gave our guidance for the year, it was based upon a range of market growth numbers of 2% to 4%. At this point having a half of the year behind us and markets growing at a lower number in these first couple of quarters more on the order of 2%, we don\u2019t think a 4% is realistic anymore and that\u2019s why we trimmed the top end, but we\u2019ve held the bottom end of our range at $4.50. All the numbers showing on this particular page do exclude the impact of the aerospace divestitures and the items related to the Meritor and Triumph litigation. If we move to page 15, this is the full-year bridge and really just two changes on this full-year bridge. What doesn\u2019t appear on this page that was there and when we gave you guidance for the last quarter was we\u2019ve anticipated that ForEx, we\u2019d have about $200 million negative impact on revenues this year. We no longer think that is true as we\u2019ve seen a number of the currencies move or prepared to talk about that during questions. So that negative $0.04 is disappeared off this page and that negative $0.04 offsets the $0.14 \u2013 that negative $0.14 that you\u2019ll see is the second item listed on the several negatives here that is new on the page here and that relates to the logistics mix and pricing in the Electrical Systems and Services area, so a net of $0.10 and that\u2019s the difference in our midpoint obviously between the $4.70 that we have had is the midpoint of our operating earnings per share and now the $4.60. No changes on page 16, which our Cooper synergy projections. We really just provided this for your reference. If we move to page 17, this is our bridge from our second quarter actual to the third quarter guidance, again starting with $1.11 that we\u2019re reporting today. Obviously, we removed the industrial sector restructuring expenses of $0.08 that was $39 million that we\u2019re incurred during the second quarter. We expect higher volume of about $150 million, or 3% very much in line with what we generally see between the second and the third quarter. We\u2019ve got additional synergies. We\u2019ll be realizing from all the work we\u2019re doing at Cooper synergies of about $10 million and that\u2019s about $0.02 and then we\u2019ve got higher corporate expenses of about $0.04, yes, generally you\u2019ll see the second half of our corporate expenses run higher than they do in the first half and that\u2019s how we get to the $1.25 for our guidance \u2013 midpoint of the guidance for the third quarter. Moving to page 18, obviously when you look at our first half earnings, first and second quarter together earnings at $2.12 to reach obviously our full-year guidance that means its $2.48 of operating EPS in this second half and we felt that will be (indiscernible) a little bit about this. Let\u2019s start with a top-line higher volume of about $500 million at the incremental that we\u2019ve been talking about this year of 26%, our best estimates are that our markets grew at about 2% versus the first half. If we see some gathering strengthened and we think they will grow closer to 4% in the second half and that\u2019s how we get to our 3% market guidance. If you think about when you try to think through where does the $500 million of volume come from, please remember this is first half versus second half. So one of the big steps in volumes was the $275 million step up between the first quarter and the second quarter. As I mentioned to you in pervious chart when we detailed the third quarter guidance, we\u2019re talking about volumes moving up about $150 million in the third quarter compared to the second quarter. And then it\u2019s typical for us with our mix of businesses that volumes declined slightly in the fourth quarter from the third quarter that\u2019s the exact same pattern that obviously that what we\u2019re talking about that\u2019s embedded in our guidance. We won\u2019t have the industrial restructuring expenses in the second half that we had in first half, about $39.08 million, additional Cooper synergies of $0.05, lower pension expense of about $0.05, lower taxes of about $0.04 and then the higher cooperate expenses as I mentioned before was second half normally runs higher than the first half about a negative $0.12 and that\u2019s how you get to the difference between the first half and the second half. If we turn to page 19, this is simply the summary we give you kind of key elements supporting our guidance. Just a few items that have changed here, if you scroll down to, I guess that\u2019s the sixth item the tax rate, we\u2019ve increased that to 6% from 5% and again remember all of these numbers here excludes the impact of the aerospace divestitures and the items related to Meritor, Triumph. The real reason for the slightly higher tax rate is that our earnings are higher in some of the higher tax jurisdictions, i.e., the U.S. for example. Again, that goes back to our view how the economic outlook is laying out this year with U.S. being one of the stronger regions and many of the areas outside of the U.S. is actually being weaker. Obviously, our operating EPS for full year, we lowered that by $0.10 at the midpoint by dropping the top end from $4.90 to $4.70, we kept the $4.50 the same at the low end. And then you will notice on the operating cash flow and the free cash flow, in each case, we\u2019ve lowered them by about $200 million, really reflecting the lower profitability that\u2019s comes out of our guidance and also a little higher working capital that we\u2019ve anticipated when we started the year, no change to CapEx. So if we turn to Page 20, summary, second quarter results were very much in line with our guidance on revenues and margins either the guidance we gave at the beginning of the quarter or the update we gave through the 8-K of roughly a week ago. Excluding the unusual items and the restructuring costs in the industrial sector, EPS was up about 9% versus last year that Cooper integration remains very much on track. We\u2019re very much in the midst of many of the plant moves that we\u2019ve discussed with you at this point. We will deliver the $95 million of incremental benefits compared to 2013 here in the year of 2014 and another $150 million for 2015. The industrial sector restructuring is in place and we will yield as we have told you at the end of the last quarter about $35 million of benefits next year, so between the two about a $185 of benefits on next year compared to this year. And our best look at pension cost which we often try to share with you as we get to the middle of a year is that with this kind of rates that we used the last time that we calculated this based up on our fuller funding of these plants and the markets having done a little a better, it would be on the order of about $35 million less than this year. Now with that I would like to add just one of the final note is that and it is not in those packet but there has been a lot of speculation about whether it would make sense of Eaton to spinoff any of our businesses in light of the transformation that we\u2019ve been undergoing over the past 14 years. And as I have commented in many different forums that each of our businesses remain really a key contributors to our results and we continue to see real benefits from being able to apply our multiple power management technologies to meet our customers\u2019 needs and these different verticals. But we also want to clarify that we are not able to do a tax free spin of any business for five years post the acquisition date of the Cooper transaction and that that limitation means that any spin would result in a very significant tax liability. So for the two reasons we think of our power management strategy and obviously this five year kind of prohibition that any form of kind of economic benefit means that that there is not a really compelling economic rationale for further portfolio transformation. So we hope that provide some clarification to a number of questions that a number of investors have either asked or written about over the last month. So with that I wanted to really take the time to get through a couple of those specifics around the margins because I know they cause some confusion after our release. So with that Don, why don\u2019t we go ahead and open things up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Donald H. Bullock: Our first question comes from Steven Winoker with Sanford Bernstein. Steve Winoker \u2013 Sanford Bernstein : Thanks and good morning. Just first question on ESS and S&S margin declined about 200 basis points, you call that would just takes mix in pricing pressure. You mentioned power distribution, power quality, was there any impact (indiscernible) your power systems from Cooper? Sandy Cutler : As I said Steve, I appreciate the question, first good morning. Steve Winoker \u2013 Sanford Bernstein : Good morning. Sandy Cutler : It was a very much an as I mentioned that we see it in the large power distribution assemblies in the power quality business and that\u2019s specifically where we\u2019ve seen a competitive activity and the logistic issues lays across a number of the businesses, but again is primarily in those very big assemblies. Steve Winoker \u2013 Sanford Bernstein : Okay. And within that you\u2019d call that back up and I would recall the February investor presentation, roadmap to about 16% in 2015 and it looked to me like I think two thirds of that was some synergies, I mean I am just talking about this segment, electrical systems and services and the rest between market and outgrowth. I assume this changes your outlook on that basis now? Or you\u2019re making it up something it up someplace else? Or how are you thinking about that? Sandy Cutler : Yes, I think if you recall we also had increased our margins in electrical products and as you see, we\u2019re pretty consistently getting that available from the revenue and bookings point of view as well as getting the higher margins. I think it\u2019s a little early to put a number on 2015 and we would really like to get a better sense for how bookings progress here in the third quarter and obviously the second quarter was much improved in terms of the magnitude of the bookings as well as we think the quality of the booking. So a little early, I appreciate your question, but I think we will be in a better position to really be able to answer that we come out of the third quarter. Steve Winoker \u2013 Sanford Bernstein : Okay. And then just finally on the guidance first half to second half, I looked backwards. It looked to me like normal seasonal growth first half to second half as more or like to 15% ramp and then you would called out incremental synergies being weighted towards the back half of that $95 million and I am not sure the $0.05 really reflects that. I mean you can maybe talk through that a little bit more? Sandy Cutler : Obviously a lot of \u2013 as you get underneath that $500 million of the higher volume in the second half versus the first half, a couple of issues relative to market. As I mentioned, we saw the vehicle markets and the hydraulic markets on a year-over-year basis were far stronger in the first quarter than they were in the second quarter. I mentioned that when we\u2019re talking about the vehicle businesses that we think the NAFTA heavy duty business will be relatively flat from this point forward and that you\u2019ve had roughly to 74,000 units production level which is basically what you need kind of finish these next two quarters, so won\u2019t get as much of an impact there so by deduction it was an Hydraulics here we call its generally weaker in the second half than in the first half each month so what really prepared us is Aerospace in electrical and you saw the very strong bookings in both those segments 9% in Aerospace and 6% to 7% in each of the two segments in electrical and so that\u2019s why we\u2019re really looking for the higher sales levels. Steve Winoker \u2013 Sanford Bernstein : Okay. And then on the some of the incremental synergy of that $95 million now first half versus second half. Sandy Cutler : Yeah. And that\u2019s the additional 2% either you see of the about $25 million of additional benefits that higher in the second half than there is in the first half. Steve Winoker \u2013 Sanford Bernstein : Okay. All right, thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Joseph Ritchie \u2013 Goldman Sachs : Hi. Good morning, everyone. Sandy Cutler : Good morning. Unidentified Company Representative : Good morning. Joseph Ritchie \u2013 Goldman Sachs : Just to stand with ESS margins for a second and can you clarify a little bit more Sandy what do you mean by higher logistical costs, because it seems like a lot of the unexpected variants was in the legacy Eaton Business. If I\u2019m just trying to get a better handle of that. Sandy Cutler :  That\u2019s primarily freight cost, that it\u2019s a \u2013 it\u2019s been a surprise to us how quickly free cost move during the second quarter and part of this has to do with the size of the equipment that we\u2019re shipping and its moved up quiet significantly during this time period. Joseph Ritchie \u2013 Goldman Sachs : Is that something that is expected to continue just given that you\u2019ve had, now stronger bookings in ESS moving forward, I would imagine if that\u2019s the business insulting that has subsides in the near-term. Sandy Cutler : That\u2019s part of the reason why we moved to our guidance, you\u2019re right that\u2019s one of the reason why we moved our guidance down for the balance of the year. Joseph Ritchie \u2013 Goldman Sachs : Okay. And then I guess one other question on ESS, you mentioned pricing pressure and clearly, the bookings number with a positive this quarter plus seven, talk us through maybe that the pricing or competitive dynamics that you saw in the bookings that you put into your backlog just this quarter. Sandy Cutler :  Well, as I mentioned earlier we\u2019re comfortable at the improvement that we\u2019re forecasting the second half really is driven by what we\u2019ve been able to successfully book here during the second quarter. I think if you look back over the last six, some quarters in this segment, you saw our bookings levels that when they were positive we\u2019re in this kind of 1% to 2% range then you recall it they went negative in the fourth quarter in the first quarter, those tend to have in this kind of the business which is a backlog based business tend to be sort of a precursor what\u2019s going to happen in the next quarter so, we\u2019re pleased how we see that we had a very strong quarter in all by what I would say is the large power of quality types because that side of market continues to be weak. But the power distribution side, whether and each of the end markets are continue to be quite strong. We\u2019re seeing good indications of continued strength in non-residential and oil and gas in particular so that we are encouraged by what we saw here in the second quarter now obviously we got to ship it and we are pretty comfortable we know how to do that but we don\u2019t think these logistic costs are likely to go away. Joseph Ritchie \u2013 Goldman Sachs : It's interesting to me you think about the margin for the business for the back half of the year, you are basically implying something over the 14% for ESS which you are comfortably there last year, and so I guess a one last question on ESS. Can you kind of talk through may be the puts and takes to the specific margin guidance like where could be disappoint or potentially be more positive or constructive on in the back half Alexander M. Cutler:  Yeah. I think in the guidance that we provided are they can add a lot more homework character to it is, I think that one thing we always tried to stress for people understand any of electrical systems and service business hence they have a higher data to it both when the market is expanding or contracting because it tends to be a lot of large projects are tend to go into expansion if you will, equally true in terms of what happens with the mix of projects that can change from quarter-to-quarter and we\u2019ve obviously did not have a good quarter in that regard here in the second quarter with the knowledge of what we have got in our backlog at this point, our best view is that we\u2019re going to see the improvements that you\u2019ve referenced in terms of second half being a stronger half than the first half, but it\u2019s still not to the level that we\u2019ve had anticipated originally this year and that\u2019s why we reduced the guidance for the second half. Joseph Ritchie \u2013 Goldman Sachs : Great. Thanks. I will get back in queue. Operator : Our next question comes from Scott Davis with Barclays. Scott R. Davis \u2013 Barclays Capital : Hey, good morning guys. Alexander M. Cutler: Good morning Scott. Scott R. Davis \u2013 Barclays Capital : Can you give us just a little bit more color on aerospace margins in 80 bps down a year and you said half of that was from structuring. I would have thought in and up 9% sales environment you\u2019d have been able get some operating leverage is that just more of a mix issue? Alexander M. Cutler : Yeah its again a whole series of different projects in there, but I would say this is very much in line with our guidance I wouldn\u2019t be as concerned myself about this thing moving a couple of tens of a point one, one direction or another, the real issue that we are particularly pleased was is the aftermarket business is starting to rebound you may recall it over the last two years we\u2019ve talked about that one of the challenges is with the commercial OEM production increasing as quickly as it is after market hasn\u2019t been able to keep up with that. And we\u2019re now starting to see, seasons that fill in and we think some of the initiatives that our team has underway to help in larger aftermarket business are really starting to show up. So we\u2019re not yet seeing a 20% increase in what we\u2019re shipping in terms of aftermarket because this stuff has some lead time as well, but we are starting to get to a point where it\u2019s a more representative percentage of the total business. Scott R. Davis \u2013 Barclays Capital : Okay. Fair enough. And then question on ESS, that your comment on pricing pressures and I guess I am little surprised that incremental I mean power quality particularly in Europe has been weak now for a couple years, few years. Why is that incrementally getting worse on price. Is there \u2013 it\u2019s just a function of excess capacity or it\u2019s just someone in there as an rationale trying to gain share or new entrance anything that\u2019s changed. Alexander M. Cutler:  I don\u2019t think \u2013 the single phase piece that we\u2019ve talked about which really is over in the product side, I think those conditions have been fairly similar with the weak server sales around the world. This tends to parallel or be a pretty good surrogate for the demand that we see then on the accompanying UPS and that continues to be much as the same issue.  I think here on the larger products which tend to be the three phase products which tend to appear for us more in this systems and services segment. We\u2019ve got a couple of things going on, one we talked when we were at EPG this year about the fact that there is a change in the technology of the power solution in the large data centers.  I remember that\u2019s not the biggest part of this market, but there you\u2019re ending up with a little less power quality equipment in a little bit more power distribution equipment in average large data center. I think that\u2019s going on its not as much of a technology change inside the UPS itself it is, it\u2019s a change in terms of how people are utilizing them. So I\u2019d say that change is going on, but I would say we still have not seen the large enterprise system data center is accelerate to the extent that we\u2019ve seen the kind of mobile or let me call them hyper scale mobile data center is really come on and so then the enterprise have typically been the people like the big financials and large industrials and they\u2019re not spending as they were a couple years ago. Scott R. Davis \u2013 Barclays Capital : Okay, fair. And then just clarification, Sandy you commented about that the tax status if you're to do a spend obviously that \u2013 it\u2019s off the table, but is there anything that would impact you selling a business. Sandy Cutler :  No. Not versus any other normal sale that you\u2019d make in terms of looking at price and looking at after-tax proceeds. Scott R. Davis \u2013 Barclays Capital : Okay. Fair enough. Great and thank you. Appreciate it. Operator : Our next question comes from John Inch with Deutsche Bank. John Inch \u2013 Deutsche Bank :   Thank you. Good morning everyone. Sandra Pianalto :  Good morning, John. John Inch \u2013 Deutsche Bank : Hi. So I just, I realized there is a lot moving parts, but in a nutshell so the 500 plus second half volume Sandy, if you compare the second half of 2013 versus the first half that was up 222 what is bridging the gap is it truck, is it something else, because you\u2019re taking your market forecast down, so I\u2019m just \u2013 just in a very high level, what\u2019s the accounting for the sort of $2.70 delta incremental second half volume this year versus last year? Alexander M. Cutler: : Again we\u2019re seeing the aerospace market continue to grow fairly consistently. We\u2019re seeing hydraulics slow in terms of that growth this year. Better vehicle year-over-year growth, and that\u2019s different than we saw in the second quarter where it was a little solid and the rest of it\u2019s the electrical business. John Inch \u2013 Deutsche Bank :  Would you characterize your guidance as \u2013 I\u2019m just trying to put this into a context, because obviously, we don\u2019t want to get into third quarter, and have to cut this forecast again, is it an extrapolation of the run rate that you see or are you leaving yourself any kind of cushion with respect to kind of the 3% and then the 4.5% out growth? Alexander M. Cutler:  Yeah, the 3% is our best estimate of these markets, and of course we can be wrong on that, but it\u2019s our best estimate at this point. So, we are not trying to build a cushion, John \u2013 or be overly rest of it, it\u2019s our best estimate at this point. John Inch \u2013 Deutsche Bank :  Can I ask about hydraulics, we had three quarter in a row of high-single digit or low-double digit bookings, and what exactly \u2013 why did that not manifest itself into some better top line, was it \u2013 I mean were there any sort of cancellations of orders, I mean I\u2019ve realized, you\u2019ve got a lot of exposure to say North American Ag, is there anymore color you can give us. We all know what the China headlines are \u2013 is there anything else, that\u2019s going on that might account for that discrepancy? Alexander M. Cutler:  Our bookings numbers are net of cancellation, so don\u2019t simply gross book and not report cancellation. So, we\u2019ve seen, if you go back, really, you recall it a year ago, it was a fairly weak booking number in the same quarter. Since then, we\u2019ve seen three quarters that were really quite strong, and then we\u2019ve seen the second quarter, that obviously came down. I think what we\u2019ve seen is, the industrial activity has been okay, not great. And the biggest increase was occurring in the mobile side of the marketplace. So, was these with the ag manufacturers, who have clearly backed off at this point. And construction equipment, is okay in the U.S., it\u2019s not great outside the U.S., and it\u2019s pretty awful in China, and I\u2019d say that, that\u2019s where the difference has been, China has actually gone down further. Richard H. Fearon:  In gentlemen, on the last call we\u2019ve pointed out that often the OEs when they start ordering they\u2019ve quite long dated orders, and so that means that you will have a surge of orders, but they extend that over a long period of time. And that\u2019s why we had some of a gains we had in the prior quarters, as Sandy mentioned actually OE orders were down in the second quarter. John Inch \u2013 Deutsche Bank : Rick are you suggesting that the three quarters of the strength that actually can still manifest itself even though it\u2019s kind of in future quarters even though the markets are under the pressure you just described. Richard H. Fearon:   Yes. Some of those orders do extend out. Now they are subject to cancellation, but some do extend out into the future. Craig Arnold : But John, we\u2019ve mentioned in numerous forms that often what you\u2019ll see large OEM\u2019s do as reserved capacity through orders and they can adjust those, but if they come out of a period of weakness they are trying to ensure they are going to have forward capacity. John Inch \u2013 Deutsche Bank : One more from me what would you say to this question that\u2019s out there with Cooper on the ESS side you perhaps there has been pressure on you with respect to market share and so you\u2019ve actually \u2013 you\u2019ve actually had to take price action specifically to Eaton versus the market to try and preserve some market share. I mean, is there aspects of some of that in perhaps some of the mix within the ESS business. Alexander M. Cutler:  I don\u2019t feel so, I think if you look across the two businesses, the channel based business where you tend to have more of a mix of product where you\u2019d be presenting a mix of product into a channel, I think you\u2019re seeing very solid performance and would have been more likely if your premise was right you would have seen that in the products area. The other segment tends to be one where you are bidding on individual jobs their individual transactions and they don\u2019t always have all the products as your premise was. So I would say no I think you\u2019d see the reciprocal of this performance if that was true. John Inch \u2013 Deutsche Bank : Okay. Thank you.\\ Operator : Our next question comes from Ann Duignan with J. P. Morgan. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, this is Mike (indiscernible) for Ann. I just had two quick questions. Can you talk about the margins again in Electrical Systems and Services? And I guess if would have pass the 200 basis point year-on-year decline. How much would you put in each of the three buckets you identified? Alexander M. Cutler: They are about equal. There is not an overload in any one of the three. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. And then following up on that in aerospace you mentioned 20% growth in bookings for the aftermarket. Any idea or color around how much of that might be provisioning related. Alexander M. Cutler: Hard for us to know exactly, because after market for us really includes spares, repairs and overhauls and so what we are beginning to see is we are beginning to see some of the news planes that came into service three years ago start to really get into the after business, but you are still seeing the commercial and you are seeing these releases from the large commercial OEM increased in double digit numbers and so that continues to put pressure and trying to get after market to catchup with that kind of number, what we are particularly pleased about in this quarter is the strength was both on the commercial side and military side. And so pretty broad-based strength in that regard. Unidentified Analyst :  Okay, thank you. Operator :  Our next question comes from Andy Casey with Wells Fargo. Andrew M. Casey \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities LLC :  Good morning. Another question on the margin guidance, I\u2019m trying to build up the 26% incremental margin embedded in the full year guidance after \u2013 from doing the math, right what appears to be a first half 19% extra structuring in Q2, and you\u2019ve somewhat addressed it aero side and S&S, but also within that, it looks like you\u2019ve fairly sizeable ramp in electrical products. Is it fair to look at implied second half electrical products incremental margin to be something north of 30%? Alexander M. Cutler:  I have to do the same calculation you are doing, but yes, again remember our guidance for the segment is higher than what we have achieved for the first two quarters, so I want be sure we\u2019re doing the math the same, but it\u2019s \u2013 we are assuming that we continue to have even higher margins in the second half than we had in the first half, and we feel pretty confident in that. Andrew M. Casey \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities LLC :  And is that just underlying demand, Sandy or are there more synergies falling into the second half than there were in the first half? Alexander M. Cutler:  There are more synergies in the second half, if you back that chart that we referenced\u2026 Richard H. Fearon: But that\u2019s broken up separately, Andy. So you have the normal\u2026 Alexander M. Cutler: Yeah. Right now, I mean \u2013 that you have in the second half of the year, and obviously a big step up from Q1 to Q2, and then you step up again, about $150 million into Q3 in revenue, and just a slight decline in Q4. And what we\u2019re saying is, we believe of that 26% incremental is appropriate for that revenue increase second half over first half, and we\u2019ve broken the synergies out of the separate line item. Andrew M. Casey \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities LLC :  Okay, and then just a higher level, and thanks for that Rick and Sandy, a higher level question, if you step back and look at through demand trends, just within North America, I mean we\u2019re seeing kind of mixed performance, but in general things continue to get better, but it\u2019s a little odd, do you have truck acting well, construction okay, but not great, and then what appears to be underlying progress and improvement for electrical businesses, and what are you seeing out there, is it just continued hesitancy for the large projects to get underway, and if so, what\u2019s causing that? Alexander M. Cutler: I think you describe it right, it\u2019s okay if not super. But I guess, you look at the flash PMIs at 56%, orders of almost 60%, manufacturing industrial product was up pretty solidly high single digits here in the U.S., here in the second quarter. We are seeing more signals we think around non-residential that it looks like it\u2019s picking up some more, the residential is drifted a little bit more and you\u2019ve all seen those numbers, we don\u2019t see utilities moving substantially at this point.  The construction equipment is a little better but mining is not great. I think on the ag side it\u2019s weak. And if you think about the vehicle Markets, Class 8 is strong, light vehicle continues to be pretty strong almost a 17 million SAR in June and then weak government spending. So you do end up with a little bit of a Ying and a Yang, and that\u2019s why we say, we think, overall you end up with subpar economic growth in the U.S., but it\u2019s better than the rest of the neighborhood. And so when you\u2019re looking at Europe, still struggling to get its full momentum, South America is pretty rugged, China still an attractive overall number, but very inconsistent by market vertical within China. So I would agree Andy with your general view on it, and that\u2019s why we say we still think the 3% is the right number we don\u2019t think \u2013 for overall Eaton Markets we don't think four is possible with the start, that the year started with. Andrew M. Casey \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse. Julian C. H. Mitchell \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hi, thanks. Just on hydraulics, the bookings numbers have been bouncing around a lot so I just wanted to check. The sort of operating earnings ex-restructuring were about the same year-on-year in Q2. When you are looking at the second half, you basically assuming a very similar EBIT progressions what you had last year in Hydraulics. Richard H. Fearon: And generally Julian just in our Hydraulics business with its more heavy mobile loading, generally the first half is a little stronger, the third quarter tends to be the weaker quarter for hydraulics, when you look through the year. And we don\u2019t think that\u2019s likely to be substantially different this year. Julian C. H. Mitchell \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC:  Okay, will your hydraulics earnings be kind of up or down year-on-year in the second half in your guidance? Richard H. Fearon: Though I have to \u2013 full year-to-year comparisons, we really been looking more in terms at our first half versus our second half. Sandy Cutler : It should follows the normal seasonality that you saw last year though, Julian. We don't see any reason for us to be different than that. Julian C. H. Mitchell \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC:  Got it. And then in electrical products, as you pulled out a couple of times, you\u2019re looking at a steeper sort of margin jump year-on-year in the second half than what you had in the first half; is that solely related to the sequencing of Cooper synergies or is there something in the underlying business that\u2019s also driving that? Alexander M. Cutler:  You are seeing pretty strong growth, again I remember second quarter up 6% from the first quarter up 4% from last year, you\u2019re seeing six very attractive quarters in a row of growth about what the most people consider the markets to be. So I think you are getting some leverage in the business there in addition to the fact that, then we get the synergies to drop in as well. So I think we\u2019ve got both of those working for us quite well there. Julian C. H. Mitchell \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thanks. I mean just lastly, I hate to come back to this, but electrical systems and service, is there \u2013 at some point a view on kind of the market segments that it targets or something more strategic, I guess you\u2019ve had it for about a year and half now, you moved some costing back in Q1 out of products, so I guess is there anything changing strategically on how you\u2019re viewing what\u2019s happening there or is it just sort of a bunch of bad one off items in the first half and those should normalize? Alexander M. Cutler:  Yeah, I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s a change in market segments, because we serve with our market shares, we serve the very broader array of what\u2019s out there, clearly we\u2019ve made some very substantial progress in oil and gas, but it\u2019s not there is a different economics if you will to that set of end markets activity which is more an issue of logistics, this particular mix. And as we\u2019ve said, from pricing that really comes, we think from this weaker period of demand, and so we\u2019re encouraged with what we\u2019ve seen with our bookings here in the second quarter. I don\u2019t want to overplay that, but it\u2019s the best set of bookings we\u2019ve seen in six quarters, and I think that\u2019s significant in itself. Julian C. H. Mitchell \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC:  All right. Thank you. Operator :  Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Jeff T. Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners LLC : Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen. Alexander M. Cutler:  Good morning, Jeff. Jeff T. Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners LLC :   Sandy, I was wondering if you could come back to your comments on the spin, and may be just a little color on \u2013 or the difficulty in doing one so that speak, the color on kind of controlling regulation or law that brings you to that conclusion. And I\u2019m also just wondering, there\u2019s obviously been some fresh speculation from myself and others, but these questions have been out there before, I\u2019m just wondering why, what kind of learning aside to your limitation now, does this reflect the fact that you yourselves have dug in and looked at it much more closely, and have found the roadblock or is there some other explanation? Alexander M. Cutler:  Jeff, let me comment. Because of the legal steps we had to do to complete the Transaction for Cooper, there are a couple of code sections that make it not possible to do a tax free spin for five years, and it\u2019s a conclusion our team can do it, it\u2019s not a simple analysis, but they came to it and then several outside advisors corroborated that. So, we are very certain of that analysis is accurate.  And, Jeff it\u2019s not new knowledge, we\u2019ve been well aware of this all along and I have tried to indicate that, we had no intent to do any such actions, we\u2019re just trying to help make it clear for people that it\u2019s not simply an issue of will, it\u2019s also an issue of some very technical issues at this point. Jeff T. Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners LLC : : Richard H. Fearon:  It actually would be taxed higher than just an asset sale for some complex reason. Jeff T. Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners LLC :  Okay. Richard H. Fearon:  So that has been difficult to make work economically. Jeff T. Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners LLC :  Okay. And then just shifting gears back on price, one of your competitors noted that there was some price pressure in lighting and some of the low voltage areas of their portfolio. Are you seeing that anywhere in the lighting specifically or any of the other kind of industrial low voltage businesses? Richard H. Fearon:  Again our lighting businesses and our electrical products segment in terms of just thinking where it appears for us and you can see our margins are continued to be quite strong there. I think as the LED conversion goes on, clearly there and we\u2019ve talked to this on a couple of occasions, there is a payback competition if you will between LED and to the traditional lighting sources that were very comfortable with \u2013 where we are positioned with our technology leadership there. Jeff T. Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners LLC :  And then, just finally from me just a comment on pension, I get it it\u2019s an early read but the market could be in all kinds of gyrations between now and year-end with paper and everything else, that does your comment reflect something idiosyncratic at Eaton intention or is it just the general view on where we think rates and other kind of items might be? Alexander M. Cutler:  We were simply trying to give some general indication of what would likely happen to our pension expense next year and the easiest way to do that was simply to say if interest \u2013 discount rate stayed about the same, just based on our asset performance and based on some particular things that happened in 2014. We believe that you would see a reduction on expense of about $35 million next year. That can change and will change but it give you a rough indication of what might happen. Jeff T. Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners LLC :  Okay. Thank you guys. Operator :  Next question comes Chris Gleynn with Oppenheimer. Christopher D. Glynn \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.:  Thanks. Good morning Alexander M. Cutler:  Good morning Richard H. Fearon:  Good morning. Christopher D. Glynn \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.:  I just had a question in the wake of the two legal settlements if you could comment on, if there is \u2013 you see any potential for customer backlash and market place push back? Alexander M. Cutler:  I really can\u2019t comment, we don\u2019t expect any at this point, but no further comments. Christopher D. Glynn \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.:  Okay. And then on the tax rate, we have 6% for the year. There are a number of adjustments obviously, so it would be helpful if you could just address the 3Q and the two second halves specifically, what we\u2019re looking out for tax rate? Alexander M. Cutler:  We are expecting the tax rate in the third quarter will be much like the second quarter, it will drop we believe based on our visibility right now, a bit in the fourth quarter. Christopher D. Glynn \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.:  Okay. Thanks. Operator :  Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley & Co. Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yeah, thanks. Just a couple of clarifications. I hate to dive back into ESS margins, but Sandy can you put finer points on what's causing the second half improvement versus the first half and you\u2019ve mentioned price mix and freights and hopefully then we have the higher volumes coming through in the orders, is it repetition of Boeing leverage on the order pick up or is it, are we seeing improvement in price mix. And if you can just give us \u2013 if you can just give us quite a bit of detail on price mix delta you\u2019ve seen, second quarter and second half? Alexander M. Cutler: I\u2019d say it\u2019s both of the items you mentioned, one is obviously it\u2019s having the far stronger quarter of booking. We start the quarter with a full backlog, and secondly we\u2019ve got, I\u2019d say an improved look in that backlog versus what we had as we came through the last quarter. So I\u2019d say bulk of those items are \u2013 were influencing our thinking relative to the second half being stronger than the first half? Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: And what\u2019s caused the improvement in price mix in the last three months? Alexander M. Cutler: It\u2019s better pricing. I don\u2019t mean to be flip about it, but it happens to be the mix of projects and there are 100s and 100s of individual projects that are represented in any one month. So it\u2019s very hard to be, it\u2019s this project or it\u2019s that project, but it\u2019s a collective math of what we\u2019ve seen in terms of projects in the marketplace and what we\u2019ve landed. Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, great. And then, Rick, just coming back to the pension of $35 million, does that bake in the penalty schedule? Alexander M. Cutler: Yes, it does. Again, this is still half year away. But it does bake that in. Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you very much. Operator :  We are going to have time this morning for one additional question because of the number of other calls going on simultaneously, we want to be respectful of that. So we have time for one more question this morning. And that comes from Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc. Jeffrey Hammond \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets : Hey, guys. Most of my questions have been answered. Can you just talk about what\u2019s driving the better free cash flow guidance? Alexander M. Cutler:  That\u2019s slightly lower free cash flow you mean, and we reduced both operating cash flow and free cash flow by $200 million and it's two factors as our working capital performance has not improved to the extent that we had thought it might and then secondly the reduction in the net point of our earnings guidance that\u2019s what behind the $200 change. Jeffrey Hammond \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets : In the working capital is that related to the Cooper deal that you\u2019re hoping to get improvement there or. Alexander M. Cutler: No. It\u2019s much more broadly just in terms of where we really seen receivables and inventory so far this year. So, it\u2019s really a tuning up based upon where we are at high year. Jeffrey Hammond \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets : Okay. Thanks. Alexander M. Cutler: I want to thank you all for joining us today. As always, we'll be available for a follow-up question both this afternoon and the remainder of the week. Thank you very much, Operator : That does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Welcome to the Eaton Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we\u2019ll conduct a question-and-answer session; instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] And as a remainder, the conference is being recorded. And I\u2019d now like to turn the conference over to our host Eaton\u2019s Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, Mr. Don Bullock. Please go ahead. Don Bullock : Good morning. I\u2019m Don Bullock. Welcome to Eaton\u2019s third quarter 2014 earnings conference call. Joining me this morning are Sandy Cutler, our Chairman and CEO; and Rick Fearon, our Vice Chairman and CFO. As has been our practice, we will begin today\u2019s call with comments from Sandy, followed by the question-and-answer as the host alluded to you earlier. Before we move into the call, I\u2019ll take a moment to draw your attention to the statement on page 2 of the presentation. It contains certain; our presentation today contains certain forward-looking statements. The comments on page 2 outline those factors that could cause actual results to differ from what\u2019s outlined in the presentation. These factors are noted in today\u2019s release and also the 8-K. In addition, the presentation contains certain non-GAAP measures as defined by the SEC. A reconciliation of all of those measures and the most directly comparable GAAP equivalent is provided on the Investor Relations page of eaton.com. With those opening comments, I\u2019ll turn it over to Sandy. Sandy Cutler : Great, thanks Don. And thanks everyone for joining us this morning. I\u2019m going to work off of the earnings presentation which was posted earlier, and hopefully you\u2019ve all got that in front of you, I\u2019m going to start on page 3 that\u2019s titled highlights of the Q3 results. Just a couple of comments here, we had a \u2013 we think a very strong and balanced quarter in the third quarter as you\u2019ve already read our operating EPS it was above the midpoint of our guidance it came under the $1.29 versus the $1.25 that had been the midpoint. Significantly that operating EPS is up 15% from a year ago in markets that are I would describe as in overall as a less than robust. Our sales were up some 2%; core revenue was up 3% and then obviously reflects the impact of ForEx of the negative about 1 point. As you\u2019ll hear us talk as we go through each of our businesses and the total corporate results, revenues really as for the tail of two cities strong conditions here in the U.S. as the U.S. continues to strengthen and then weaker conditions as we get outside the U.S. and just as one indication of that when you look within our core revenue being up 3%. The U.S. was up almost 7%, so we\u2019re doing quite well in our businesses here in the U.S. Our record segment profits which were really pleased to see here we call the first quarter segment profits were 14.5%, second quarter they were 14.6%, but I think you remember that we had taken some restructuring expenses on our industrial businesses during that quarter, without those restructuring expense the margins would have been about 15.2%, now obviously the all-time record 16%. All of that drove a record operating cash flow of $943 million that excludes the legal settlements that were settled in the second quarter and we paid out as we\u2019ve mentioned to you in numerous forms paid out that cash early in July. On the free cash flow was that a very robust 14% of sales, really pleased with that performance. Strong bookings in electrical again 4% overall, aerospace some 12% and we\u2019re really pleased that all the work we\u2019re doing to integrate the Cooper acquisition remains very much on track. If we turn to page 4, just a very quick and pretty simple reconciliation to our guidance you recall as I mentioned our guidance the midpoint was $1.25. Our record margins which came in about $0.04 stronger than we thought that was really in the electrical systems and services segment. I\u2019ll speak more about that. But very pleased with the very full recovery we made in the third quarter frankly a little faster, we had said that we thought we would get an average of about 14% margins in the third and fourth quarter. We obviously came in above that in the third quarter, then aerospace came in slightly higher powered by some of the strength of our aftermarket shipments sales. I\u2019ll speak more about that in a moment. With volumes coming in just a tad lighter than we had indicated, when we were looking for about a $150 million of incremental revenue when we gave our guidance for the third quarter. We worked very hard on productivity and expense control across the company. Our corporate expense came in as you saw it about $64 million versus the mid 80s guidance that we had provided. Taxes were about 2 points lower and that offset the lower than expected volume compared to our guidance and that was just about a $120 million lower expected physical volume and then a negative 65 impact, $65 million impact from ForEx. Again compared to consensus our volume was about $14 million difference in consensus out there. So, overall up some from $0.04, we think a very solid quarter of execution. If we move to page 5, just the corporate numbers that you\u2019ve already seen with the overall sales 2%, 3% core growth that adds back to 1.4 for ForEx. I think the recent number speak very much for the prelim itself no impact of acquisitions or divestitures at the total corporate level. So, topic right into the business segment, if we turn to page 6, another very strong quarter performance in electrical product segment, our biggest segment in the company. As you can see sales up some 3% from last year, core growth up 4%. We think really solid when we look, whether we look against peers or look against market here. Margins expanded to 18%, bookings raised significantly up 5%. And when you look within those bookings, once again the story is very much the same as I\u2019ve already mentioned twice about strength in the U.S. bookings over 8% in the U.S, really strong numbers here again. And Asia-Pacific was stronger, as you might expect Europe being the area of still looking for stabilization in those markets and that\u2019s the area of weakness. As we look within those bookings lighting continues to be an area of continued strength, volume up from 19% our LED participation or percentage of \u2013 percent of our total lighting revenue at 45% really leading the industry. I\u2019m very pleased with that. If we look around the world, we\u2019re pleased on the U.S. our demand for industrial products, our industrial control products up some 15% in the quarter as well. Strength in the Middle East, and we\u2019re pleased that they were seeing some pretty strong activity, compounded activity in Asia now well not as true on the system and services side, but I\u2019ll come to that in just a moment. So, we think a really solid quarter, very much hitting our targets for performance here in terms of volume and margins. If we move to electrical systems and services segment, perhaps I think the highlights of the quarter in terms of really converting upon our improvement plans here, come back and talk about those three areas that work particularly on here in the quarter. But obviously volumes up 1%, 2% of course, so again a negative 1 point from ForEx, up 2% from the second quarter as well. Probably the big highlight is the margin of 14.6% up from the 12.7% disappointing performance in the second quarter. Bookings up 3% again over 5% here in the Americas region, so very much that same outlook and a number of you would recall when we talked about volume increases in the second half of 2014 that one of the portions of the systems and services businesses where we are counting on with strong services increase. Our bookings were up over 20% in the quarter, and services it was very much converting and we had thought, we\u2019re seeing a little better tone on utilities where we actually we\u2019re up about plus 6 in that particular area and doing well on the power distribution gear side. The weakness continues in the large UPS markets, whether it\u2019s here or in Asia, and as we spoke to you we thought that it would be the condition that we continue for this year. Just a quick comment, following the second quarter and during our second quarter call we talked about initiatives to get our margins back in line with our own expectations that were around freight and logistics that are around capacity rightsizing and prior quality business and about continuing strong bookings momentum and getting a better price tone. If you recall the time I told you that, there we needed improvement in all three of those areas that they were about equally weighted, frankly we had hopefully we would get to as I mentioned second half margins of 14%, which would have had us a slower in the third quarter than 14%, a little above 14% in the fourth quarter clearly. We got back to 14.6% for one quarter really good progress on all three of these, there was not a significant change in material cost. So that\u2019s not what drove these increased margins, increased margins came for getting the progress we targeted in those three areas. And we expect that to continue in the fourth quarter as well. If we move to hydraulics, another challenging quarter in hydraulics and I think we gave you some indication of what our thoughts were in terms of what was happening in the market, at the end of the second quarter, we\u2019ve talked about it all through the third quarter that, while we\u2019ve talked about China construction equipment weakness over the last year or two, the big change in this market has been what\u2019s been happening in the global ag market and particularly in the U.S. and in Europe. You\u2019ve all seen the announcements from the major OEMs, a very significant turn in their outlook in terms of what they are doing with anticipated sales and production announced the production as an impact on us. Let me turn first to the issue of bookings which are down 6%, very significantly our distributor orders were flat; they are actually up in the U.S. But the real story to understand what\u2019s happening in the bookings level here is that, our OEM bookings were down 19% and if you took the ag market out of that total of OEM bookings. All our other OEMs are up some 6% and that includes the global construction market. The real weakness is in ag due to significant cancellations in the Americas, in EMEA, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s probably a surprise and if you are following the ag market just going through preparation for quite a down cycle. We\u2019ve tried to be quite transparent that we think that next year will be a down year in ag equipment as well. And so, this quarter where our sales were down from last year 1% and again when you get under the 1% down in volume of shipments, and now switching shipments. Distributor settlement is quite good up 7% OEM down 6% really driven by the ag side again. So our large exposure to ag is obviously showing up in this quarter, the 11.7% margins are influenced by the lower margin and the fact that we\u2019ve taken our inventories down in responses as well. We think that this is a condition that\u2019s likely to carry into the fourth quarter; we\u2019ll see some small improvement in margins, but this kind of level in volume in the typical fourth quarter being slightly less than the third quarter in terms of volume as I think how this will play out in the fourth quarter as well. I\u2019m going to switch to aerospace, really a terrific quarter in aerospace. If you move this is page 9, if you move to the slightly green colored box in the left hand lower side of this chart, you\u2019ll see the core growth was 6%, you see right the divestiture is 6%. These are the two smaller units that we divested in the second quarter that we now have a full quarter of the lack of those sales. So, the actual organic growth in the business was really quite good, in fact very good, 6% we\u2019re very pleased with the bookings up some 12% and had both positive bookings on both the commercial and the military side of the business. Significantly, we call out on the yellow box that aftermarket shipments accelerated during the third quarter that obviously is a help on the margins and I think you saw the very strong margins of 15.9%, you recall we\u2019ve had a number of quarters now, these past several quarters, we\u2019ve had significant acceleration on the aftermarket spares and repairs activity. And we\u2019re starting to see that come through in the shipments here as well. We move to the Vehicle business, another strong quarter of performance, volume up 5% again core growth up 6% margins up 17.4%. We obviously raised our guidance for the NAFTA heavy-duty Class 8 build to 295,000 units for the year. We can see that finish line pretty clearly here as we said at the end of the third quarter really fourth quarter in terms of what this year looks like. And I think in addition, to the strong September NAFTA heavy-duty orders of almost 25,000 units that we\u2019ve seen in the marketplace. We\u2019re hearing pretty good news about what October is going to look like as well. So, I think continued good news. The weakness in this particular market is the same as we spoken to you about and it has not turned around from production point of view, South America, Brazil in particular continues to be very weak in its vehicle markets. And so we\u2019ve got again a little bit of a story of two different worlds here, the very strong North American activity, the very weak Brazilian operation and remember that Brazil is a pretty big percentage of our business that\u2019s outside \u2013 of the U.S. in this particular segment. So, if we turn to 11 sort of wrapping up 2014. Full year segment margins, we still think to be above 15.2%, I\u2019m sure there will be individual differences by decimal point in these five different segments as we get to the close of the year and wait all the quarters. But overall we\u2019re pretty comfortable with 15.2% that\u2019s we shared in the \u2013 in our earnings announcement. We think the full year market growth is, likely to be around 2% where the U.S. market is growing at an attractive 3% level and the rest of the world growing at more like 1%. ForEx obviously has been a big change vis-\u00e0-vis what we first saw at the middle of the year, and you saw we had about $65 million year-to-year of negative ForEx in the third quarter. We think the full year is now likely to be on the order of some $220 million, for those of you who are doing the quick detection of that means more in the fourth quarter that was in the third quarter that is correct, because most of that currency change occurred in September. So, if they stay at these levels, we would get three months so that impact in the fourth quarter instead of largely one month of impact in the third quarter. And we\u2019re really pleased that with all the complexity of all the different programs that our teams are working, they are doing a great job and the Cooper synergies remain on track for this $210 million in 2014, which to remind is about $95 million of incremental synergies and profits in 2014 compared to 2013. We turn to page 12, operating earnings per share same numbers that we showed you full year at the end of last quarter, so we\u2019re holding that guidance that\u2019s up 11% from the previous year. The fourth quarter midpoint in terms of operating earnings per share were $1.20 that\u2019s also up 11% from last year. So, in markets that, we think are growing on the order of roughly 2%, we think very attractive leverage in terms of the profits dropping through. If we move to chart 13, its titled comparison of Q3 to Q4 for 2014, that was the starts for the $29 which we reported for the third quarter. We will again get about another penny I think from Cooper synergies. Margins in our fourth quarter for those of you who following our company for sometime, normally are about half a point lower in the fourth and they are in the third quarter, a portion that has to do with their regions of the world of our large parts of December are not business days. And that would account for about $0.06 drop from the third quarter to the fourth quarter that is inline well with our expectations were for the fourth quarter when we put our second half guidance together at the middle of the year as well. ForEx we think, as I mentioned it will be on the order of about negative $100 million comparing the third quarter to the fourth quarter that can drive about $0.02 and then the normal lower core volume that we see with the fourth quarter being slightly less than the seasonal peaks in the second and third quarter. That will be in the order of about $50 million, and so that\u2019s how we get to our $1.20 obviously putting that together with our first three quarters, puts us at our full year midpoint that I covered on the previous stage. Chart 14, is provided just for quick summary of the key elements that we try to provide in our guidance and discussion about results. A couple of changes that I have already mentioned, but I would just highlight them for your record keeping ease on this chart. Market growth it was at 3%, we\u2019ve lowered at the 2% as I mentioned before that changes all the occurring outside of the U.S. ForEx you may recall, we started the year thinking it would be about a negative 200, we got to the middle of the year and it didn\u2019t look like it was going to be at that level 1 to 0. We now think it\u2019s a negative 220, I think further confirmation that we know-how particular does a great job of forecasting ForEx. And then if you drop down to free cash flow, it\u2019s up $50 million, so it was $1.8 billion to $2.0 billion, as we\u2019ve gotten through the year this year and I\u2019ve looked kind of the pace of all of the programs and the programs we prioritize, we think we\u2019ll be spending about $50 million less than we thought when we enter the year. I would call that tuning, it\u2019s not a reflection of any programs being behind, it\u2019s really just our ability to get it spent this year. If we turn to page 15, a summary of the quarter and the year, as I mentioned, we think it\u2019s a very solid quarter of performance clearly ForEx surprises a little bit, but I think it probably surprised almost everyone. Record margins really reflect all the work on productivity and effective cost control. Record free cash flow, we think really good look into 2015, I\u2019ll talk a little bit more about that in the next chart, running at 14% of sales. We think the market conditions in the fourth quarter likely to be similar to Q3, the only modification of that I would say is just as a seasonal difference in the first quarter. And that we think a very solid attractive year this year with 11% operating EPS growth coming off the year with relatively modest worldwide market growth in terms of our markets. I know very much on your mind at this point is, what is 2015 start to look like, its \u2013 we\u2019re in the midst of our operating planning. So, we can provide you only with a couple of kind of broad-based indications and obviously we\u2019ll address this in far more detail in January in our call at that time. But maybe a couple of comments to reflect, we think market growth is likely to be similar to 2014, I think the big trends there are continuing growth in the U.S. and lower growth outside of the U.S. As you break that down kind of into our individual businesses, I think this our general feeling is that aerospace is likely to be a little higher growth than the average, hydraulics is going to be a little lower growth than the average. And the other franchises are going fall sort of somewhere in between. As we\u2019ve mentioned in our last call and I would reemphasize again today, we\u2019ve got two very big drivers and sort of self-help here in terms of another incremental $50 million of Cooper synergies, another incremental $35 million of benefits that come from the restructuring we did in the second quarter of this year in our industrial sector. And then the negatives that we spoke to you about earlier that we do expect that our tax rate will move from this roughly 6% this year to something and that 9% to 11% range next year. And then finally an issue that many of you have asked us about and we\u2019ve discussed in quite some detail over the last year and a half. It has been our expectation ever since we announced the acquisition of Cooper by the middle of 2015; we would have the vast majority of our acquisition integration activities completed. We would have been paying off the major portion of the debt that we had indicated, we will repay back that we took on this part of the acquisition. And that the company will have the opportunity at that point to really be thinking through what is as around the very significant cash flow that we are driving at this point. And that\u2019s likely to include either getting back into the M&A markets and/or share repurchases. We\u2019ve not taken our finger off that chest piece at this point, you saw that we did purchase about $225 million of stock that was roughly 3.4 million shares in the third quarter. We\u2019ve had the capacity we believe that, if we decide it makes sense to continue us purchases in the fourth quarter, but that\u2019s frankly a decision we\u2019ve not reached yet. And as we get into 2015, I think it\u2019s just to open without some very attractive alternatives for us as we get back to the point where our balance sheet is considerably strengthened and we would have completed most of this integration, which really gives us the confidence than to think about new initiatives, as I said that either around the M&A side or on the side of purchasing back shares. So once again, we think a very strong quarter one that we really hit on upon the key elements that we felt that we need to improve upon it, if we came on a second quarter I think it sets up the fourth quarter entering next year on a strong basis. So with that, Don, I\u2019ll turn things back to you and look forward to people\u2019s questions. Don Bullock : Very good. Our moderator will give you some instructions for the question-and-answer session. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley : Thanks, good morning. Sandy, I just want to pick up on your comments, your last comment on the share repurchase and/or M&A. And I think most of the thing of 2016 is as really when, the balance optionality opens up. So, mid 2015 is a bit earlier, so I\u2019m just wondering if anything is changed with the competition of the agencies et cetera. And in terms of, the pan limit REPOs this is M&A, I\u2019ve got to think that the common share price REPOs would be where you are thinking more so? So just any comments on that would be helpful. Sandy Cutler : Thanks Nigel. And you\u2019re right, we do feel that we have the mature year of our synergies in 2016, but we have been pretty clear that most of the actions and decisions will have been completed by the middle of 2015. And what we\u2019ve been indicating over the last six months is that, we think that it opens some opportunities, we continue to kind of hit the cash flow numbers that we are that we can begin planning those activities in the middle 2015. Obviously, if it was M&A it\u2019s likely to be something that we would think might not close to later in 2015, but that doesn\u2019t mean that you don\u2019t get the work done earlier in the lab. I \u2013 we tend to agree with you at the kind of share levels that we\u2019ve seen more recently, it has to be a pretty special acquisition to be one that would outpace the REPO. Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley : Okay that\u2019s helpful. And then just switching to ESS margins, you indicated that your plan was for 14% margins in 3Q, you came in at full obviously ahead of that 14.6%. So, what was, what drove that outside of this year plan and should we then think about 4Q being sequentially higher than the 3Q, given your initial setup? Sandy Cutler : And you stated what I said correctly is that, we did think that the second half would average 14% with the language that had used and really proud of the job our team did in terms of really addressing all three of the improvement areas that we said we had to work upon. So it\u2019s not our expectation, we would give that back. So that it\u2019s our expectation we ought to be operating at petty similar levels as we go into the fourth quarter. This is a business unlike some of the other sectors where seasonally the volume goes down on a number, normally in the systems and services business the volume stays a little more constant going into the fourth quarter, because there is an awful lot of large installation to do repair and service work over the various different holidays that are sprinkled to the fourth quarter. So, our expectation is that, that would stay at these types of levels in terms of profitability. Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley : Okay. And then just quickly, the ESS orders today reflect therefore pricing discipline on some of the larger project opportunities? Sandy Cutler : I would say that the biggest issue there is still Nigel is the weakness in the very large power quality markets. And I think you\u2019ve seen that from a couple of our peers who have announced this well. That\u2019s the piece that is not as robust, the power distribution side is, I recall fairly robust as we go forward this time. Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley : Great. Thanks Sandy. Operator : Our next question comes from Scott Davis with Barclays. Scott Davis \u2013 Barclays: Good morning guys. I just want to follow up a little bit on Nigel\u2019s question on UPS, I mean, I think some of us are trying to figure out how much of this weakness is cyclical and how much of it\u2019s circular, I mean did you see changes there and power quality eligibly that this is something it\u2019s probably going to stay weaker or longer than what you, usual cycle would be? Sandy Cutler : I think what we\u2019ve been trying to share with people Scott and then first good morning. Yes, we do think there are some important changes going on from the point of view that there has been a period of over build and then under build and we think will come back to a period of time when people will be building in more, but the topology of the technologies are changing as well. And that so the total electrical package that is sold in many of these large datacenters that isn\u2019t changing much, but the mix between the power quality of UPS and the power distribution side is changing. And that\u2019s not in all of the datacenters, but it is in what we call some of the web 2.0 or hyperscale type of datacenters. And we spoke to that at several conferences this year. So, I do think part of what we\u2019re going through right now, is that we got some areas where people have pulled back on spending all of these drivers of capacity continue to happen. So, I think we\u2019ll step back into that, but it does mean that companies got to have these new topology to really be able to deal with the change in the mix of product. We do, we sell obviously both the power distribution and the power quality. So, on a net-net basis that doesn\u2019t make us softer, but it does made us a little slower on the product quality side. Scott Davis \u2013 Barclays: Fair enough. And I just want to get a sense of where your thought process is Sandy on, your stock price has been a little disappointing, I think it had a tough year and you\u2019ve lost that, for a while you\u2019re trading more like a multi-industry company now you\u2019re back to trading more like a machinery company. And does it make you start to wonder whether you\u2019re ever going to get credit for moving towards being an electrical equipment peer play that maybe some of the more cyclical businesses are always going to have an outsized influenced on where you trade? Sandy Cutler : I think for us Scott, it\u2019s really all-around performance. And, I think that we\u2019ve built a company that has balance, it has balanced from a geographic point of view. It\u2019s got balance from how it participates to the cycle that is balanced in terms of its different businesses. And I think what we\u2019re trying to deliver for its shareholders and owners is a stream of income and revenues that continues to grow right through the cycle regardless of what\u2019s happening around the world. There will be individual quarters where an individual business or region in the world won\u2019t be a strong as others that\u2019s part of being a global company as part of being a diversified company. So, we still think we can deliver on that strategy and that promise. But we have to deliver it each quarter and that\u2019s what we\u2019re really focused on. Scott Davis \u2013 Barclays: Okay, fair enough, excellent. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Steve Winoker with Bernstein Research. Steve Winoker \u2013 Bernstein Research : Thanks and good morning guys. Sandy Cutler : Good morning. Rick Fearon : Hi. Steve Winoker \u2013 Bernstein Research : Maybe just start off with that 2015 guidance, any preliminary thoughts and how you was thinking about the corporate line items in pension and some of those other, can be large swing factors? Sandy Cutler : Yes, maybe just on the pension issue, you may recall at the end of the second quarter, we had opined that, if rates had stated similar rates that we might see a tailwind, a positive tailwind in terms of pension cost. I think about as quickly as we said that, we saw interest rates and discount rates continue to move in confounding directions. And so, I think our guidance at this point is that, we just don\u2019t know and we\u2019ll see when we get those rates at the end of the year. So, that\u2019s why you don\u2019t see that on our summary list at this point. I think in terms of the corporate expenses, I mean obviously you see that we have really worked hard on productivity and cost, all through the company as markets have grown a little less quickly than we all might have hoped at the beginning of the year. I think you got to assume that\u2019s going to continue as we go forward. We think this worldwide economic outlook that we have is one that basically says that U.S. is going to continue to be the strongest part of the neighborhood. But you\u2019re going to see Europe struggle through challenging times on a continuing basis and that what\u2019s going on in the emerging nations will be quite inconsistent from country-to-country. And that\u2019s what sets our belief that, you have to be ready to run your company successfully with this growth rate of that what we\u2019re experiencing around 2%. Steve Winoker \u2013 Bernstein Research : Okay, well on the \u2013 maybe on the segment margin commentary, ex-cost synergies in that implied in that guidance as well. So, and if you get the $185 million between cost synergies and restructuring benefit, but normally even if you didn\u2019t have that and you\u2019re steering at 3% plus core growth in the business, you should see some positive fall through on the margin side. Maybe how are you thinking about that? Sandy Cutler : I think what we\u2019ve indicated there Steve, as we think for this 20% to 25% is probably the right way to be thinking about that going into 2015. And obviously as we get to our operating planning, we\u2019ll share far more detail on that and kind of margin targets for each of our businesses as we start the year next year in January. Steve Winoker \u2013 Bernstein Research : Okay, all right. Maybe I\u2019ll be have a little more luck here, on the Cooper synergy discussion then. How is the, last time you gave us the, I think with slide 16 in Q2 and look through the annual pretax synergies, I assume there is no change to that thinking. But are you really seeing these revenue synergies come through, because you\u2019ve got slower market growth, you\u2019ve got the even the outgrowth that you\u2019ve talked about it\u2019s a little hard for me to tell whether you\u2019re really getting some of these sales synergies? Sandy Cutler : No definitely, we\u2019re really quite excited about it, and I think you see that and the comparison when you go to our electrical product segment, you look back over bookings just as your first quarter 6%, second quarter 6%, third quarter 5%, good on the peer numbers, the electrical industry and we obviously look at those pretty hard in terms of the core numbers. And you clearly see what we\u2019re gaining, I think for those who are out there in the channel and have been at the major customer conferences. It\u2019s pretty clear for those who are closely and they know we\u2019re gaining and these synergies are coming through. There is no question about it. Steve Winoker \u2013 Bernstein Research : Okay, I\u2019ll pass it on. Thanks Sandy. Operator : Our next question comes from Ann Duignan with JPMorgan. Ann Duignan \u2013 JPMorgan: Hi good morning guys. Sandy Cutler : Good morning. Rick Fearon : Good morning. Ann Duignan \u2013 JPMorgan: Sandy, can you just talk about as you look across your different businesses and you talk to your new chief economist, what does lower in oil prices do to each of your businesses, obviously there may be some upside to vehicles perhaps and maybe downside just some other business, just conceptually how are you thinking about that? Sandy Cutler : Ann, obviously there have been some forecast put out this last week and 10 days, which obviously people I think spending a little bit, we personally are not bought into the $75 oil forecast. But, having said that, with lower prices there are obviously oil prices there are couple of businesses that again, it takes some time for these changes to come through. But, obviously the vehicle markets that are enhanced by that lower cost, obviously will help the aerospace industry as well, because it\u2019s lower cost there as well. We think it helps residential construction, because the consumer has more money. It helps utilities, because the utility cost go down, their cost of operation go down as well. I think within oil and gas, because the \u2013 I think the question in everyone\u2019s mind is, how severely does this push back investment in oil and gas and awful lot of the activity is going on in oil and gas is actually downstream not upstream and the type of work that has to be done there and we\u2019re really quite excited about our revenue potential in 2015 and 2016 in that particular area. And when you do go upstream you\u2019ve probably seen some of those stuff that\u2019s been published recently in terms of the number of rigs that have to be extensively we work as over 30 years old. I don\u2019t think a relatively short-term change is going to have, and a short-term six to nine month is going to have a significant impact. So, I deal to your question, I think there are number of businesses that get a plus out of lower prices and we\u2019re not a big consumer industry, we\u2019re reading the same thing everyone else is reading. That people anticipating on lower Eaton costs that the consumer may do well both at the pump well there would be a close lower Eaton cost. That would be our general thinking. Ann Duignan \u2013 JPMorgan: Okay, on net-net more of a positive than the negative is that, if you\u2019re going to 50\u2026 Sandy Cutler : I think for many of our businesses and I think on the issue as you know how long does it stay down, because obviously if it stays down for a couple of years. I think then you\u2019re likely to have an impact on spending patterns by the major oil and gas and service companies. Ann Duignan \u2013 JPMorgan: Okay and then, thank you that\u2019s good color. And then following up, your lighting strength, just a point of clarification, you said volumes was up 19% was that unit volume or is that revenues? Sandy Cutler : That\u2019s revenues. Ann Duignan \u2013 JPMorgan: Okay, thank you. I appreciate it. I\u2019ll get back in line. Sandy Cutler : Yes. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc. Jeff Hammond \u2013 KeyBanc: Hey good morning guys. Sandy Cutler : Good morning Jeff. Jeff Hammond \u2013 KeyBanc: Just one last one on 2015, and I think maybe Rick touched on this at a conference, but how are you thinking about restructuring cost the $40 million you spent this year kind of going away versus, finding other restructuring to do? Rick Fearon : I think we\u2019ve been consistent on this Jeff, since we spoke last spring and announced our attempt to do that is, the $39 million that we\u2019ve expanded, we said it was going to be 40 it turned out to be 39 in the second quarter, was a pull forward as some activities that we had not anticipated doing during 2015 when we started 2014, when we started our plan. Having said that, we\u2019re doing restructuring all the time in our company and we would expect that we would continue to be doing that in 2014 and 2015, I think is just a normal part of doing business. We encourage people to think about the $35 million of benefit, but that the 39 would not go away i.e. that is part of the overall restructuring we do year-to-year. The only reason we call that out this year that was the change to our plan and once we had started the plan and we saw markets start to weaken. So, you should not take 39 plus 35 and assume that a source of profits next year. It would be the 35 on top of this year\u2019s profits. Jeff Hammond \u2013 KeyBanc: Okay perfect. And then just on free cash momentum, can you talk about how you\u2019re thinking about pension contribution, cash restructuring and working capital in 2015 versus kind of how it played out in 2014? Sandy Cutler : Yes, I think in terms of the pension Jeff, it\u2019s a little early for us to be able to say per se, because the interest rates are, and discount rates are proving to be a little bit more volatile than we might have thought they would be. It would be less than we did this last year, but we\u2019re not yet comfortable we know how much less. Rick, you want to add anything to that. Rick Fearon : Well the other factor Jeff that you will know is Congress passed a bill that reduced the minimum required contributions for 2015. So it gives a little more lead way, but nonetheless still heavily impacted by the discount rate. Sandy Cutler : On the question of cash restructuring, our restructuring tends to be pretty close cash and profit impact and I think you may recall that we didn\u2019t include the chart simply, because it haven\u2019t changed. But that the anticipated acquisition integration cost in 2015 were 35 million and that\u2019s our best thinking still at this point. So, no change in that regard, then you had a third element Jeff. Jeff Hammond \u2013 KeyBanc: Just working capital? Sandy Cutler : Working capital. Working capital as generally run above 16%, 17% of sales and so I think whatever your assumption would be of incremental volume next year that\u2019s a pretty good number to assume in that regard. Jeff Hammond \u2013 KeyBanc: Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Andrew Aylwin with BofA Merrill Lynch. Andrew Aylwin \u2013 BofA Merrill Lynch : Yes, hi guys how are you? Sandy Cutler : Good morning. Andrew Aylwin \u2013 BofA Merrill Lynch : Just a question Sandy, you sort of described the world where U.S. is out growing to rest of the world and it doesn\u2019t seem like that\u2019s going to change in 2015. And as you guys put your business plan, I would guess long-term business plan several years ago, where the world looked very differently and it was the international growth emerging markets on the industrial side that drove the growth. Are you guys giving any thought to long-term changes in your capital allocation i.e. shifting investment more to the U.S. changes to M&A strategy? What are your thinking about that? Sandy Cutler : And I think Andrew, you\u2019re right whether your memory in terms of our view, and that was sort of pre-2008 and that once we came out of the recession, our view was that Europe was going to come back more slowly, because we really thought the amount of restructuring that have been undertaken, in the countries wasn\u2019t sufficient to really put them on a growth rate. We thought that the growth in the emerging countries, because you recall that inflation took off so quickly they had to reintroduce much higher interest rates would be inconsistent. So, I would say on the run, we\u2019ve been making that adjustment all during this time period. I think China will continue to be attractive it\u2019s not going to grow the rates we saw before, but if it does grow it, it\u2019s a 6% over this time period. That\u2019s still going to be attractive, clearly geopolitical it has made Russia a whole lot less attractive. Middle East continues to be attractive to us, particular the oil and gas driven portions of it. Frankly, we had hoped India would be better, we think it will become better under Mr. Modi\u2019s leadership at this point. I think there is some early indications that will begin to change at this point. And then I think the one that has been perhaps the bigger surprise in terms of how long it\u2019s going on as Brazil and you\u2019ve heard us speak about our own caution about Brazil in terms of what\u2019s been happening in the economy and obviously with election not having resulted in a change. I think one have to assume that economy stays a slower grower than it had been pre-2008. But I would say, we\u2019ve made those changes on the run, so I would say it\u2019s not so much conclusion where reaching you at the end of 2014 and yes it does, it does impact both where we can grow, where we will grow and where we\u2019ll put incremental capital. Andrew Aylwin \u2013 BofA Merrill Lynch : And just a follow up question on ag. It seems like the order book is being built right now for the spring selling season that doesn\u2019t seem to be very strong. How long do you think until we hit the bottom, do we need to go through the full combined order season to really see where it ends up or do you think the spring selling season could be the bottom? Sandy Cutler : I think, we can\u2019t give you a decimal point on this, but our best estimate is this takes more than one growing cycle to work its way through. When we spoke to this at the end of the second quarter, we thought it could take two or three growing cycles that\u2019s not two or three years that can be 18 to 20 months. But and we don\u2019t have any indication that of any newer data than that, I think what we\u2019re seeing is that, as people become have gotten closer to their actual built schedule, we\u2019ve seen them just not only here but, also in Europe. This is primarily a U.S. and European and to a lesser extent South America kind of impact, but big ag is cut back fairly significantly and coming off the peaks. We got to start to see those crop prices move back and you all know the crop price numbers they are a long way of the peak at this point. That\u2019s going to take some time to get them back. Andrew Aylwin \u2013 BofA Merrill Lynch : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from John Inch with Deutsche Bank. John Inch \u2013 Deutsche Bank : Thank you, good morning everyone. Sandy Cutler : Good morning John. Rick Fearon : Good morning. John Inch \u2013 Deutsche Bank : Hey guys, hi Sandy just to trying make sure I\u2019m understanding exactly what you are saying with respect to restructuring in the second quarter you took a sense of restructuring understand the context of pull forward. Just as we\u2019re sort of building out models right I mean, are you planning to also take another 39 million in the second quarter, or is it kind of TBD in terms of spreading it around. So, it\u2019s a question of is it still another 39 million, I think that\u2019s kind of what you said and what we expect in the second quarter or spread sort of throughout the year? Sandy Cutler : I would say it\u2019s a TBD, because just as if we were sitting in the fall of 2013, we would have been working through our planning of when we were going to do different actions. So, I can\u2019t give you a specific quarter, but I think the way to \u2013 the way I would encourage you to think about it as we like I think most other large organizations are always working on areas and trying to improve the productivity and address issues that either on growing quickly or producing the kind of profit potential what we think are necessary. That\u2019s all I would think about that number, and it will be during the year, next year, it don\u2019t have a good enough feel right now we\u2019ll be able to share with you, what quarter. John Inch \u2013 Deutsche Bank : Based on the strength of the U.S. would it be fair to say that if you were to pursue these actions, you probably are looking at your international operations or is it again that\u2019s sort of too soon to tell us well? Sandy Cutler : I think a little too soon John, just because there is, we\u2019re going to $22 billion plus company there are always areas we can work to get better. And so it could be, it will be outside the U.S. there could be some things we do in the U.S. as well. I just don\u2019t have a good handle on our final prioritization yet. John Inch \u2013 Deutsche Bank : And just to this is a clarification, you mentioned Russia, the Russian economy looks like it\u2019s falling apart, your exposure there is pretty de minimis is that correct even with the oil and gas side? Sandy Cutler : We don\u2019t have, we have a exposure there in both our electrical business. So, that\u2019s probably our biggest exposure there, but it\u2019s not a big one, no. John Inch \u2013 Deutsche Bank : And then, the thing on the tax rate, I guess I realized there is a little bit of a black box element to this, but Rick you\u2019ve alluded to and you guys reiterated this morning a 10% sort of tax rate placeholder into next year. I thought tax rates, number one, were going to be little higher this quarter. So, I\u2019m just curious why they weren\u2019t and secondly, just to understand why the tax rates, why would they hockey stick, why would they go from 6% to say 5 points higher in 2011 to get to the high end of your range? Rick Fearon : Well you have a couple of things going on John and I mentioned this on an earlier call. In any given year you do have some one-off times that that enter into the tax picture and we have to expect it some of those this year and indeed they largely have occurred. Secondly, you have higher U.S. income and because, the U.S. is the fastest growing part of the world it does have the highest tax rate of virtually any country in the world. And so, it\u2019s the lack of those one-time discrete items plus the higher U.S. income that is really pushing the rate up. Now mind you 9 to 11 is an overly high rate compared to most others. John Inch \u2013 Deutsche Bank : Okay, so but the so you\u2019re saying Rick all of this is really just the impact of higher U.S. or is there? Rick Fearon : That\u2019s a big part of it. John Inch \u2013 Deutsche Bank : Okay. And then just the U.S. is up 7%, what got better in the quarter versus your expectations, obviously the performance was commendable, it\u2019s consistent with what other companies are saying, I mean what kind of got better and do you think it\u2019s sustainable as we roll into the next year? Rick Fearon : To think from a geographic perspective it\u2019s not that anything really got better or worse from, how we saw thought the world markets were, kind of it always felt like Asia, excuse me like outside of the United States was weaker than the U.S. I would say that the thing that is continued to be weaker that really reinforced our lowering the full year market growth from 3 to 2 is that South America has continued to be weak, no question. Europe I think we\u2019ve all read the indication of \u2013 is it teetering on the edge of something a little worse than it\u2019s been over the last couple of years. And clearly, it\u2019s taken kind of a step back from one. I think the first quarter many people felt that maybe we are starting to trying to go up. I\u2019d say those are the big two that had changed. China, the situation hasn\u2019t changed much our sales have increased there, but you hear a lot discussion around whether it\u2019s real 7% or 7.5% as well. I would say those are the two geographic areas. And I would say from what improved for us as I mentioned earlier was margins came in ahead of our expectations both in the electrical systems and services and in aerospace. And I think we have very attractive margins obviously in our vehicle market and our electrical product sector. John Inch \u2013 Deutsche Bank : Thank you. Operator : Okay. Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse. Julian Mitchell \u2013 Credit Suisse : Hi. Thanks. You\u2019ve mentioned many times that the U.S is better than all the rest of it. But, I guess it sounds like electrical globally, the market grows at a similar rate in 2015 as in 2014, and the U.S. or North America is over half of that business. And presumably in that region you are seeing better trends and utility you talked about, you have been pretty vocal about non-res getting slightly better. So I wonder, you factoring in that for an electrical that you get a steeper downturn in LatAm next year or a bigger slump in China or Europe? Sandy Cutler : I would say at this point Julian; we\u2019ve not tuned next year\u2019s forecast down into micro segments, the work that we have started doing right now. We just try to approach this kind of early view in the next year as I said. We don\u2019t see drivers of significant change at this point from the way markets are behaving this year. And, so I don\u2019t have detail, I can\u2019t really provide you to tell \u2013 this one is sub-elements is going to move to another. Frankly, we were a little bit positively surprised that the utility business had a better tone to it here in the U.S. in the third quarter than we have thought. But I say, the rest of it has been pretty much as we had expected. And we have more obviously, as we get our operating plans; we are right in the middle of going through all those reviews with our teams right now. Julian Mitchell \u2013 Credit Suisse : Thanks. And then on the outgrowth is something you used to talk about more \u2013 the sort of 150 bps of outgrowth you have delved in for this year. Any reason that changes much or any reason why you might change the way you kind of present the outgrowth? Sandy Cutler : No, no that would be our expectation next year as well. Julian Mitchell \u2013 Credit Suisse : Thanks. And then hydraulics, as you said EBIT was down more than revenue I think year-on-year in Q3 because of destocking measures sounds like that drags them into Q4. I guess how far through that destocking are you now and you sort of \u2013 are you taking measures to ensure that really in the second half of this year the destocking is ring fenced? Sandy Cutler : Yes. And again it\u2019s just \u2013 no one wants to interpret to your question, it\u2019s not distributor destocking, which \u2013 this is our getting our own Eaton inventories down because we have seen the ag demand drop off. I think it really does depend upon how much more we see in terms of drop in the market. It\u2019s a drop of that demand. They have obviously cancelled very significant portions of the forward orders that we have in our backlog. But, our hope is that we have seen the worst at this point. We will have to see as we work through the fourth quarter. As I mentioned our anticipation is seasonally, we anticipate slightly less volume in the fourth quarter than we had in the third quarter in our hydraulics business. This year we\u2019ve had pretty modest growth in the overall market that\u2019s our assumption for next year. So my hope is Julian that we have got a lot of that inventory correction done in the third quarter. I would guess, we would do a little more here in the fourth quarter. Julian Mitchell \u2013 Credit Suisse : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from David Raso with ISI. David Raso \u2013 ISI: Hi. Good morning. I\u2019m trying to size your comment significant cash to deploy. I can calculate by the middle of next year, your net debt to trailing EBITDA is probably back at 2 maybe a little bit below 2. So to help it size them, just trying to think through your comfort level with leverage. So it\u2019s the end of June next year, your leverage is down at 2 or less. What kind of capacity are we talking about, what kind of leverage are you comfortable running the company at? Rick Fearon : As we said, Dave by consistently we believe the long-term positioning of the company should be straight A, but we realized, we first got to get A minus before you get there. And so the reality if to get to straight A, if you really ultimately think about that target you\u2019d have to be about 1.5. But we aren\u2019t saying we\u2019re going to \u2013 we\u2019re not going to do anything until we get to that 1.5 it\u2019s a balance of course of rebuilding the balance sheet, paying down the debt, we\u2019ve already committed to. And just to remind, the last installment of that $2.1 billion that we committed to the agency to pay down occurs in January 2016. And so if you think about the cash on the balance sheet at September 30th, we\u2019re very close to $1 billion of cash and you think about cash generation in Q4 and then the cash generation next year is to relatively easy to see that and you also consider the pay down schedule that we\u2019ve committed to is relatively easy to see that cash does accumulate and that\u2019s what creates the optionality once you get to the middle of next. David Raso \u2013 ISI: Well, just to be clear, I\u2019m just trying to make sure you all manage expectations on a significant comment. Again, the net debt to cap \u2013 the EBITDA being down 1.5 by mid next year, it doesn\u2019t look likely just given the seasonality of the cash flow. So just to be clear, are we saying we can be down near that 1.5 by the middle of next year? Rick Fearon : No, no we also have to factor in the pay down schedule of the debt which is about $400 million in the first half $600 million in the second half of next year. What we are saying though is that even factoring in the pay down schedule we will begin to accumulate more and more cash on the balance sheet and that gives the comment about optionality. And of course, we generate the largest part of our cash flow each year on the second half. And so we\u2019ll start to accumulate as you get to the end of the first half and then we\u2019ll accumulate much more during the second half of next year and so absent taking any actions acquisitions through purchases you would expect to see at the end of next year with the relatively better cash balance. David Raso \u2013 ISI: Okay. Just to quantify\u2026 Rick Fearon : I would just add to comment Dave that and I recognize that how you\u2019re trying to calibrate this and I\u2019ll go back to what I said earlier is that by the middle of next year, we will be in the position to make decisions about deployment, it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean what we do it at the middle of the next year. But, I think we\u2019ll be in a position them having seen what the cash flow is and what the rate of improvement is that we can start to make decisions whether it\u2019s M&A and/or are simply share buyback. You see now is that we have been in the market in the second quarter we were in the market in the third quarter. I think that reflects the fact that we do have some optionality around the edge, it gets bigger as we go forward. David Raso \u2013 ISI: Again, just trying to manage your expectations here. I\u2019m just running these numbers. It sounds like it\u2019s more of \u2013 we generate roughly $2 billion of free a $1 billion goes to dividends that extra billion now we\u2019re thinking being a little more aggressive with it then necessarily leveraging the company up so just unclear on that. Rick Fearon : That is correct. David Raso \u2013 ISI: That\u2019s all I just wanted to clarify. All right. Thank you very much. Rick Fearon : Yes, certainly. Operator : Our question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with Buckingham Research. Josh Pokrzywinski \u2013 Buckingham Research : Hi, good morning guys. Rick Fearon : Good morning. Josh Pokrzywinski \u2013 Buckingham Research : Rick, just go back on your comment, I understand you might be new on the 20% to 25% kind of base incremental as we think about the framework for next year before we came to discussions about restructuring or throughput synergies. It seems like with the easy comp that you have on the ESS side and I think you\u2019re signaling that you largely fixed the issues there. It seems like there might be another $40 million to $60 million of just easy comp there on margins, should we think of that as not being a component or being something outside of it or is that 20% to 25% really more like 20% because five points to that is just easy comp. Sorry, a lot of questions there, I think you see where I\u2019m getting at. Rick Fearon : Again, I would say that we will be in a fair better position to tune this guidance as we get into early next year. But I think for this purpose, I will go back to the markets similar to this year, the outgrowth that was asked earlier, yes we do expect that to happen and I would just \u2013 20% to 25% plus there is two sources of additional profitability and we talked about being the additional cooper synergies and then the additional profitability that comes from the restructuring action we took this year in industrial. That\u2019s about us as far as we can go at this point until we have our operating plans put together. Josh Pokrzywinski \u2013 Buckingham Research : Okay, that\u2019s fair. And I guess just to follow-up on that, now thinking about 2015, but with the assessing the quarter and the progress you made, could you rank order kind of the things that went your way between pricing, productivity, synergies, raw mats, just kind of the rank order of that then, how that necessarily shakes out, kind of one our 4Q, what\u2019s sustainable, what\u2019s little bit more one-off? Sandy Cutler : Yes I think you recall there were three items that we had indicated that had led to the short fall in our targeted margins in the second quarter in our electrical systems and services segment. Those were freight and logistics there were some capacity resizing that we needed to do in the 3Q business, and there was bookings momentum, because we have had several quarters of weak momentum before that and price. They were about equal, we\u2019ve said at that time, they are about a third, third, third in terms of how they contributed to the challenges that we have in the second quarter. And I\u2019m really pleased, we made progress on all of them. So, we essentially got our fixed programs initiatives in place faster than we thought with greater effective, I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s any one of the three that is outsized versus the other. And as I mentioned earlier, we think they are absolutely sustainable going into the fourth quarter here at this point. Josh Pokrzywinski \u2013 Buckingham Research : Got you, all right. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Mig Dobre with Robert Baird. Mig Dobre \u2013 Robert Baird : Hey thanks for squeezing me in, sticking with ESS Sandy, I recall you saying that the bookings on the services side of the business were up something like 20%. Can you please confirm that and maybe talk a little bit about the drivers here, because I recall services sort of being core to the revenue synergy that you are talking about on a Cooper deal? Sandy Cutler : The \u2013 you are right on both elections. So let me do with the Cooper deal first, one of the four sources of revenue synergies in the Cooper transaction was that we felt that particularly for the power systems that was the business that we\u2019re serving primarily utilities with, Cooper had not had an internal service organization. So, we\u2019ve been in the process of beginning to service those customers with the existing Eaton service group that we have obviously in large to handle more demand. And we\u2019re very pleased that momentum is becoming to pick up. I would emphasize again that was one of the sources of synergy, wasn\u2019t the biggest one on the sales synergy, but that\u2019s beginning to go quite well and you may recall that Tom Gross spoke to that little bit at the New York Meeting, this past February, early March. And things haven\u2019t picked up as quickly than they have picked up now. So, thanks for bringing that point up. Secondly, on when we provided our guidance for the second half this year at the end of the second quarter, we had talked about that, one of the reasons we were pretty bullish on the opportunity to have a significant increase in second half over first half, electrical business was that in the last two years, we\u2019ve had some budget in our option happened on our Washington, which is tend to shut down federal spending. It was our anticipation that would not happen this year, because of the mid-year election and then indeed it has not and as a result we\u2019re seeing more of this business like services, significant federal installations continuing through this fall. So, that\u2019s indeed laid out pretty much as we thought and we\u2019re seeing the bookings and the orders for doing that. Mig Dobre \u2013 Robert Baird : That was great. And I guess my last question would be on aerospace, aftermarket starting to pick up a little bit is this a one-off or may be the start of a trend here? Sandy Cutler : And thanks for the question, it is we think the start of a trend, but what we cautioned at the end of the second quarter, I would say now as well as that it took three years for the percentage of aftermarket as a percentage of the total business to decline 5 to 8 points. I think it will take a couple of years for to go up a couple of points. We did have a very nice quarter in terms of shipments of aftermarket accelerating. But I don\u2019t think that talks us right back for the kind of 17% margins that we experienced when the overall aftermarket was at higher level in within a year or so. I think this takes a couple of years to come back, but I think it is the start of a more positive trend in that regard. Mig Dobre \u2013 Robert Baird : Wish you provide you with some tailwind hopefully into 2015. Rick Fearon : Well I think probably, even bigger as you get into 2016, because it takes sometime for this, the kind of work that\u2019s way through. Mig Dobre \u2013 Robert Baird : Great, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Andy Casey with Wells Fargo. Andy Casey \u2013 Wells Fargo : Thanks a lot, good morning everybody. Rick Fearon : Good morning Andy. Sandy Cutler : Good morning. Andy Casey \u2013 Wells Fargo : A lot of question has been asked, so I wanted to bring it back up to 30,000 feet type thing for you Sandy and ask a fairly broad question about the U.S. economy. Your first look suggest growth is going to be better in that region than the rest of the world, but really not to expect, the signal is not to expect I think growth acceleration in 2015 despite some of the early cycle U.S. markets acting pretty well, but overall growth really not gaining momentum. So, I wanted really to get your view on why we are likely going to continue to be in relatively steady growth environment as it, is it a function of capital restrict, because of lingering lesson learned during 2009, do you think it\u2019s related to export market driven business uncertainty dragging on the overall growth or is there some other factor we should consider? Sandy Cutler : I think you said on a number them, and clearly one was roughly a quarter the economy tied to export the, our biggest trading partners are doing particularly well right now. And so I would say that, that is one element. I think the second element is that, obviously the countries has not yet come to grids with its deficit, well we\u2019re laying it on in terms of the debt at a lower rate than we were, we\u2019re still running a significant deficit. And that tends to anchor economic growth to a certain degree, so that each time we start to run all faster we start to running those budget issues if you will. A number of the markets that had done quite well over the last couple of years and certainly a number of the retail oriented places, it\u2019s hard to see them grow quite as quickly as they had. And so, I think that\u2019s part of the reason when you put it all together and we\u2019ve not done the final tune up on this. We think it\u2019s more likely it grows at the current level or slightly better here in the U.S. that we\u2019re not back at kind of 4% to 5% growth in the U.S, where we\u2019re more of a 3% number. Each of the last four years the fed is had to revise down their growth rate and we\u2019re aware that there is, there is sort of, as I mentioned this anchor on the economy. Hopefully we\u2019re wrong with that Andy and we can scramble up, but that\u2019s our best thinking at this point. Andy Casey \u2013 Wells Fargo : Okay, thanks. And then just really two quick questions, within ESS, you mentioned pricing improved sequentially from Q2 does that imply the price pressure that you saw in Q2 is gone or is it just lesser factor? Rick Fearon : I would say, the pricing and the bookings backlog were coupled in my comment, you may recall that the second half of 2013 and the first quarter of 2013 were very weak quarters of booking for us and that the booking, the quarter before as a big influence on the next quarter in this business, because it is a backlog business. So the fact that we had weak loads which meant, that we didn\u2019t have as much utilization in our factories coupled with competitive pricing that really led into that second quarter challenges we had. We now had a couple of very good quarters of booking, I think the pricing tone feels a little better than it did in last winter and early part of the spring time, so the two together are what we are hoping to have really happened and we got that put in place. Andy Casey \u2013 Wells Fargo : Okay thanks. And then lastly on Europe outside of farm equipment and auto, can you discuss any view about incoming orders related to European industrial demand, is it flat, down or up? Rick Fearon : Little different by country, and I would say that the disappointment I think in this early fall into late fall has been Germany where early in the year things look a little better and they clearly flattened France there has never been start on this regard. Some people are speaking about Italy being a little stronger, we\u2019ve not seen too much of that not much of a change in order in the UK at this point. Andy Casey \u2013 Wells Fargo : Thanks a lot. Operator : Our next question comes from Eli Lustgarten with Longbow. Eli Lustgarten \u2013 Longbow: Good morning, thanks for letting me in. One quick clarification there were drop in corporate expense we saw in the third quarter, is that a new ongoing rate or one-time? Rick Fearon : So I think for this year, we\u2019re assuming, because we didn\u2019t show an increase in that fourth quarter that it\u2019s the rate for the remainder of the year. Eli Lustgarten \u2013 Longbow: Okay, and your outlook you said it would be plus minus you put electrical basically in not much difference. The U.S. market people had to product you up 8% we feel a lot of strengthening in North America and then in the U.S. in particularly in electrical products going forward in the non-res spending component, your reason that nothing much changes and that\u2019s where to be a lot weaker or is there a chance that we can get a lot better results in electrical next year, than you sort of indicating? Sandy Cutler : Well, I think it\u2019s really going to depend upon as we tune up our economy view what these other regions of the world look like, because Europe obviously is weaker and that\u2019s not contributing the growth at this point. But, we do expect, we continue to get the strong out growth as we\u2019ve indicated and but, I think that base kind of you for the U.S. is kind of a 3% growth rate. Eli Lustgarten \u2013 Longbow: And hydraulics with the big drop in ag is going on, we continue to see the pressure out to next year. Is it 12% operating margin sort of stabilization point we\u2019re looking for in hydraulics as we go forward, this point you indicated fourth quarter be little better, so it seems to be at that point that we can manage with ag that weak? Rick Fearon : Yes. In ag and those of you who follow their business for sometime, it should be hydraulics know that profits are always stronger in the first half or in the second half it\u2019s a bit of a seasonal in that business for us. And this year, we\u2019re saying we think profits coming around 13% this year. And we think that likely that we can get to margins that are kind of in that range next year or little bit stronger, but it\u2019s, we\u2019ll have a better feel for once we complete our profit planning work. Eli Lustgarten \u2013 Longbow: All right. Thank you very much. Operator : Then our last question today comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Joe Ritchie \u2013 Goldman Sachs : Thanks for squeezing me in guys. And I only have one question. I may have missed this earlier Sandy, but have you talked a little bit about your October trends and kind of the cadence as you went through Q2, Q3 and into this quarter? And then I know that you\u2019ve said that truck seems like pretty good news today, I\u2019d be just curious to hear it across your different businesses. Sandy Cutler : We don\u2019t have October numbers yet and Joe, so it\u2019s more of what I would call anecdotal discussions under these facts, but and that\u2019s how I would treat the truck information as well too. There is a lot of buzz out in the marketplace that October is going to be a very strong month of order bookings. Generally, what we\u2019re hearing in our electrical businesses is a very much continuation of the strength we saw in September as well, not much has changed on the side of the ag side as it\u2019s still pretty much working through this, there are lower anticipated shipments next year which means lower production for us right now. So and aerospace tends to be, recall a longer cycle business so not much change there. So, I would say we feel pretty about the overall feel as to where we are in our electrical business. We work our way through hydraulics which again remember that\u2019s about 12% or 13% of the company. And the vehicle sides whether you\u2019re about the truck or retail sales of cars and I think people respond to the lower gas prices there really quite good so, strongest again in the U.S., weaker outside the U.S. Joe Ritchie \u2013 Goldman Sachs : Okay, great. See you guys in a couple of weeks. Sandy Cutler : Thank you very much for joining us today on our call. As always, we\u2019ll be available for follow up questions for the remainder of the week. Thank you. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our teleconference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T executive teleconference service.

And welcome to the Eaton Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] And as a remainder, your conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Don Bullock. Please go ahead. Don Bullock : Good morning. I\u2019m Don Bullock, Eaton\u2019s Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you all for joining us for Eaton\u2019s fourth quarter 2014 earnings call. With me today are Sandy Cutler, our Chairman and CEO; and Rick Fearon, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer. Our agenda today includes opening remarks by Sandy, highlighting the company\u2019s performance in the fourth quarter, along with our outlook for 2015. As we\u2019ve done in our past calls, we will be taking questions at the end of Sandy\u2019s comments. The press release from our earnings announcement this morning and the presentation we will go through today have been posted on our website at www.eaton.com. Please note that both the press release and the presentation include reconciliations to non-GAAP measures. A webcast of this call is accessible on our website and will be available for replay. Before we get started, I\u2019d like to remind you that our comments today will include statements related to the expected future results of the company and are therefore, forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from those of our forecasted projections due to the wide range of risk and uncertainties. Those are described in our earnings release and presentation. They are also outlined in our related 8-K filing. With that, I will turn it over to Sandy. Sandy Cutler : Great, thanks Don, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. I\u2019m going to work from the presentation that we posted earlier today and I am going to start on chart #3, its entitled Highlights of Fourth Quarter Results. Clearly, we finished the year with a strong quarter of performance. We are really delighted that our operating earnings came in at $1.27, up full 18% over year ago and that was versus our guidance as you recall of a $1.20 for the fourth quarter. Sales up 1%, the really bright news I think in terms of the revenue line though really the organic revenue growth of 5%, the highest since the fourth quarter of 2011. We had record fourth quarter segment margins at 15.9%, you may recall we were at 16% in the third quarter and our guidance at that time was that we'd expected margins might come off as they normally do seasonally by about a 0.5 point in the fourth quarter. Clearly, we did substantially than that. And these overall margins of 15.9% at the segment level were up 1.3 points versus a year ago. Record operating cash flow of $944 million, obviously a cash conversion ratio of about 119% in the quarter over 12% of sales and then we continued in the fourth quarter as we had in the third quarter and second quarter repurchased our shares repurchased $326 million of shares that was 4.8 million shares. I think if you recall from having added up what we did in both the second and third quarter, that\u2019s a total amount of 9.6 million shares or $650 million expended in repurchasing them during 2014. So a total of buy backing about 2% our outstanding shares during 2014. If we turn to the next chart, chart four, it\u2019s entitled Comparison to Fourth Quarter Guidance. As I mentioned, we are very pleased with the $0.07 beat, really made up of three items. The big headline fairly is the higher margins of 15.9% versus the 15.5% that drives $0.04 of the beat. Lower tax rate really came as a result of legislative changes not just here in the U.S. but elsewhere around the world for about $0.02 and then the lower share count that I mentioned that\u2019s a result of buying back of 4.8 million shares in the fourth quarter $0.01. So, again, as we look at this the real big news is obviously the better margins. If we turn to chart five, a summary of really all the numbers you saw in the press release, so I am not going to walk through all these numbers. I do want to just highlight in the lower left-hand corner in the green box entitled Sales Growth. Again, the organic sales growth of 5%, we think really strong record, obviously performance here in this quarter. If we turn to the next chart, which is labeled Electrical Products segment and we will start to go through, give you a couple comments on each of the operating segments to report, obviously, our largest segment of the company about 33% of the company, a very strong quarter of performance. As you can see sales were up 2%, organic was up 5% and here we start to see the impact of ForEx in the quarter, which grew in the fourth quarter to be more significant than it had been earlier in the year and as we will talk about 2015, we think that\u2019s going to continue to grow as we move into 2015. But sales up 2%, 5% organic, very strong margin performance at 17.6%. I think when you look behind the business in terms of the activity that\u2019s going on. Bookings were up 4%. But once again this is very much a story of great strength in the Americas and then weaker activity outside the Americas. Anything you will hear us talk about really in terms of each of our businesses and to give you just a dimension of that. Our bookings in the U.S. were up almost 7%. So I think you can get a sense for the difference around the world. Again, we get into individual products and end markets, lighting again very strong, volume up 13%. We are delighted that our investment in LED is really paying off, about 50% of total revenue, now in the fourth quarter was actually LED. Very strong and residential very similar numbers to what we saw in lighting, industrial activity was quite strong. We are pleased with the rebound in our Canadian business that was quite strong. Those really the highlights of where that booking strength came. You may recall bookings in the third quarter were 5%, booking in the fourth quarter 4%. So, continued nice tone in this business. If we move to the next chart, entitled Electrical Systems and Services segment, about 29% of the company, obviously a very nice quarter here. While sales were basically flat with the third quarter and flat with last year. You continue to see the, I think very strong margin performance here. I think many of you\u2019ll recall we've had disappointing second quarter, we\u2019d indicated at that point that our plan was to get our margins in the second half to an average of 14%. You recall in the third quarter we were at 14.6% and the fourth quarter we were at 15.2%. So, obviously, significantly stronger than we had laid out in the second quarter. Bookings were flat and once again in this particular business we've been seeing a real flatness or weakness on the power quality side, really around the world. And here in the U.S. somewhat of a split in terms of the major project work, in terms of small projects, things aimed at sort of light commercial type market continued to be very robust. The very large projects, more heavy industrial tend to be weaker and tend to being postponed at this time period. And then, I would say, the Utility markets continue to be a weak at this point. Many of you, I am sure are looking at the bookings progression here, 3% in the third quarter, zero percent in the fourth quarter. I'll talk a little bit more about the implications of this in terms of our guidance for next year. But it does mean that we would expect to start in this segment a little slower in the first half of next year, because, obviously, the last two quarters of bookings have been little weaker. That\u2019s all in our guidance already. If we move to the next chart, Hydraulic segment, about 13% of the company again. Clearly 6% volume decrease from a year ago. If you look toward the green box in the lower left-hand corner, you see that 4 points of those 6 points was ForEx, but no question the market itself weaker as we\u2019ve talked about. Margins of 12.2%, down from a year ago, up just slightly from the third quarter, which was 11.7%. And when we get inside the economic, economic activity here again, I think you look at our bookings, they declined about 3% from a year ago. But again very similar to what we discussed with you in the third quarter, distributor orders were up 9%. It was the OEM side of this business that was down again double-digit, down 22% and the story within that OEM weakness is exactly the same as they was in the third quarter. It\u2019s the story of the big ag retrenchment going on here and so that really had, okay, tone, with our OEMs, but very, very weak here on the ag side. As we look forward and I will talk a little bit more about this when we talk about guidance. But we will be taking some actions in this business to restructure our business further in light of these volumes and I will talk a little bit more about that in terms of how it lays out in 2015. Next chart, Aerospace, just less than 10% of the company. We think a really fine quarter, volumes up 2%. But again I can refer you to the green box in the lower left-hand corner, organic growth of 9% offset by, as you recall, the divesture of the two small business units, we divested during the second quarter this year, that\u2019s how we get 1 point negative ForEx, that\u2019s how we get to the 2%. Bookings continued to have a good tone here, both on the commercial and the military side. Commercial is a little stronger than military, but they both positive numbers. And the aftermarket running at about 8% continues to be robust. And we are really pleased to see that activity, very solid margin performance here at 15.4%. And then finally, the next chart entitled, vehicle segment, about 17% of the company. We think a very strong quarter, volumes up 4%, margins of 16.9%. Within that volume, again if I can refer you to that green box on the lower left hand corner, 8% organic growth, very strong growth offset by 4% negative ForEx impact. And for those of you who are looking at the 320 basis point increase in margins, the 16.9% versus the 13.7% last year, I think you recall in the fourth quarter of '13, we had a number of launches, high volume launches that we had not done as well on and that had depressed those margins by about 1.8%. So I think the real correct comparison for you to think about is 16.9% versus sort of a run rate a year ago of about 15.5%. Now we are at the front end of -- we continued to have a pretty attractive number of quarters here in terms of economic activity within North America in heavy duty truck business. I think most of you saw in December the NAFTA Class orders came in at 43,800 units that\u2019s for the industry. The fourth quarter total orders were 130,900 units. And if you look back over the total bookings for 2014, we believe it maybe a record year of individual bookings in the industry, all that is leading to our forecast of a build -- an industry build for NAFTA Class sales of about 330,000 units this year. And we think it\u2019s going to start at a pretty brisk level, about 82,000 units in the first quarter, about 85,000 in the second quarter, about 82,000 in the third, and then 71,000 in the fourth, and that\u2019s our present view for how this will lay out over the quarters this year. We can then move to chart 11, which is entitled highlights of full year 2014 results. We think a very good year. Organic revenue growth of 4%. FX was just 1% this year. And of course in our guidance, we will be talking to you about a negative 4% next year. So, three additional negative points going into 2015 about what we experienced this year. With all the puts and takes and changes in economic environment and individual operating issues, our guidance originally was $4.70 and we came out with $4.67, up 13% over a year ago and it does exclude the legal settlements and the divestiture gains. Segment margins up 40 basis points to 15.3%, operating cash flow, excluding the legal settlements, a record $2.53 billion, that\u2019s about a 0.9 cash conversion or just over 8% of net sales, the Cooper integration, really doing very, very well. We have fully achieved that $95 million of incremental savings that we expected to achieve in 2014. And as I mentioned earlier, all this has enabled us to repurchase about 2% of our outstanding shares at a cost of $650 million this year. If we then kind of switch hats here and move out of '14, although we would love to talk some more about the fourth quarter results, but we know your interest is really in trying to understand our thinking about 2015 and that really starts on chart 12 of this packet. Clearly, we are operating and what I think many people have titled mixed global economic conditions. And our view on that really has not changed, the relative US strength, the weakness in Europe and Latin America, the slowdown in China, and then probably the newest factor that was introduced in the second half of 2014 is the extreme currency volatility that we\u2019ve all seen and that\u2019s done nothing but accelerate into the New Year here. So set in that context of overall global GDP that we think is going to be around 2.5%, we would expect our organic revenue and this is combination of both market and whatever we do to grow in excess of that to be between 3% and 4% 2015. And what we have raised for you on this chart is our view of the likely ranges of that organic growth in these four businesses. And maybe just to give you a little bit of color in and around this. In the electrical business, clearly we continue to see real strength in the residential markets. We think that those may well increase again this year on the order of 15%, but non-res very solid single-digit type growth, similar to what we saw -- mid-single digit, similar to what we saw this year. Utility will be one of the lower growers, maybe a 1% type market and then the global power quality markets we think will be flat, not much growth this year. In the hydraulics market, I know there is a lot of interest in trying to understand the end market activities here, not much new versus what we have been talking about. Real retrenchment of US in global ag, particularly at very large equipment area what many people are calling large ag, and those numbers on a global basis on the order of a 20% large ag pullback. US construction, mid-single digit. Industrial is pretty reasonable. Mining, a negative. And clearly, we continue to see weakness in the Chinese construction equipment market. And that\u2019s what leads us to this forecast. On the aerospace side, we see the 2% to 4% range. You are seeing commercial around the world sort of is 5% to 6% and then US defense at roughly a negative 2%. And then on the vehicle side, you have heard us already talk about our forecast of 330,000 in terms of heavy duty truck. We are in the high-16s in terms of the US retail sales. And then we continue to think that the Latin American market is not going to show much growth here during 2015. All of that leads us to this overall view of our organic revenue growth this year of about 3% to 4%, remembering again that that\u2019s going to be offset by about 4% of negative ForEx impact. Moving to chart 13, a quick look at segment margins. What we\u2019ve shown you here is in the first column is the full year 2014 actuals, 2015 ranges for each of our five segments, and then in total I think they speak for themselves in terms of that they are all increases with the exception of hydraulics. And I will comment on that one just in a moment. Electrical Products, I think pretty clear continued very attractive margins, continued growth. We get additional synergies in that segment as well this year. And so, I think no further comments needed there. Electrical Systems and Services, I did comment that and we talked about quite a bit with many of you is that this is a backlog business so that the bookings in the previous two quarters are somewhat of an indicator of lightly revenues and the success of third quarter. As a result, as we think about the first quarter in this business that is always the weakest quarter for Eaton in total, it is also the weakest quarter for the systems and services businesses. And as we look at the bookings of last two quarters, we think this business will start a little slower the early portion of this year and then pick up as the year goes on. In the Hydraulics business, all the comments I made about the tough market conditions obviously apply here. As a result of those tough market conditions, we are going to pull some additional restructuring and head into this business. Most of that will be completed or expensed in the first and second quarters. So I would encourage you to think about this business as being one that starts slower from a margin performance point of view and then margins are higher in the second half. And then as you think about the total, as you look at the 15.9% to the 16.5% for the entire company, I think you are all well familiar that we tend to have our lowest segment margins in the first quarter. And when you add two those, the two comments that I made on Electrical Systems and Hydraulics, we think a good place to think about first quarter segment margins are probably in this 14.5% to 15.0% type range. And obviously they pick up from there for the year. And if we can move to chart 14, which is the summary and I won\u2019t repeat many of the areas that I have already touched upon here that organic growth is of 3% to 4%, that\u2019s about $675 million to $900 million. And obviously you get a sense for the 4%, negative ForEx is $900 million. Corporate pension, interest, and general corporate expenses, we think will be about $30 million to $40 million higher than 2014 levels. The tax rate, this is very consistent with what we have been indicating to you over the last six months, we think it will be 9% to 11% and that obviously is different than the less than 6% in 2014. That leads us to our full year operating earnings per share guidance of $4.75 to $5.05 and our first quarter guidance of $0.95 to $1.05. Operating cash flow, up some 15% from 2014 and that\u2019s a cash efficiency ratio, our conversion ratio of about 1%. Free cash flow, obviously just the difference between our operating cash flow and the CapEx, which we think will be about $675 million. And then as you saw in our release that we anticipate about $45 million of acquisition integration expense in 2015 and that includes both Cooper, and then the last pieces of the ramp up of a few of our smaller acquisitions, also concluded in 2012. So if you move to the last chart, chart 15 entitled summary. Again 2014, we think we had a really strong fourth quarter, the 5% organic growth, the record segment margins, the all-time record quarterly cash flow. Finished the year we think well, up some 13%. We think that really steeps the basis for another record year in 2015 for organic growth of 3% to 4%, offset by the negative 4% ForEx, operating earnings growth of 5% at the midpoint of our guidance. And then we tried to give you a dimension into kind of the major elements that are affecting that 5% guidance that we are expecting ForEx is about a negative $0.20 this year. That\u2019s the impact of that $900 million of negative revenue impact and the move to that 9% to 11% tax increase from less than 6% is about another $0.17. So you\u2019ve got about $0.37 of negatives from those two headwinds. And if you were to take those out of our guidance, obviously that\u2019s what then drives the 13%. The reason we felt it was important to come back to that number is that I\u2019ve talked with many of you on different occasions about the fact that I think the challenge for industrial companies is to think about in this relatively low growth market, how do you drive earnings in this 10% to 12% range? I think our formula in terms of the acquisition integration benefits and the base earnings being a multiple of revenue is still in place. Unfortunately, we're dealing with it and we have to deal with, the ForEx and the higher tax rate issue here this year. In the first quarter, specifically, the impact of ForEx and the tax rates about $0.09. And you obviously can get the impression that it\u2019s about that same number, as it runs through each of the other quarters as well. The good news for all of this is that the Cooper integration savings and the additional restructuring benefits we had from the work we did in our industrial sector this year are helping us really offset this negative $0.37. So, again, if I just come back to the first quarter, I\u2019d ask you just to be thinking about currency and tax impacts, seasonally weakened margins, hydraulic restructuring, slower ESS start, that's what leads us to sort of our dollar midpoint for the first quarter and what we think is still going to be another great year for Eaton. So with that, Don, I'll turn things back to you and look forward to the questions. Don Bullock : Very good, Bill. Before we begin our Q&A session on our call today, I see that we have a number of individuals in the queue with questions. So given our time constraints today of an hour and our desire to get as many of those questions as possible, please limit your opportunity to one question and a follow-up. Thanks in advance for your cooperation. With that, I will turn it back over to our moderator who will give you some instructions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Don Bullock : Our first question will come from Joe Ritchie at Goldman Sachs. Joe Ritchie : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Sandy Cutler : Good morning, Joe. Joe Ritchie : All right. So my first question\u2019s really on the electrical side of the house. Can you just give us a little bit more color, Sandy? You saw your bookings numbers up in EPG, yes, that's flat and I know you talked a little bit about the industrial market and I think is great. I guess what I'm just trying to understand is, as you look into \u201815 and your organic growth assumptions of 3 to 5 across electrical, I\u2019m just trying to understand what\u2019s embedded in your substance for growth, quarter growth in those two segments? Sandy Cutler : I think we really think about the market as being across both of them, Joe. And I say that the big issue is, is really a continuation again of U.S. strengths, not much growth in Europe and growth somewhere between the U.S. and EMEA and Asia-Pacific. But I\u2019d say in the non-res market, we again think we are going to see here in the U.S., speaking to that a single-digit type performance, a single -- mid-single-digit type performance. And on the smaller kind of industrial projects, there is still a fair amount of activity. It\u2019s really large projects that we've seen have been drier in that regard. Utility, we don't expect to get a tremendous amount of help out. We think that's going to be kind of a 1% grower again this year. In the residential activity, we continue to think we\u2019ll be quite strong. So, basically, the products that go through distribution are in that EPG pieces that include service activity, which has been quite strong, as well as some of the larger projects and the smaller projects that have been quite strong is in the ESS segment. Joe Ritchie : All right. And maybe I guess my follow-up, just focusing on Hydraulics for a second. You mentioned that basically the order retention this quarter was predominantly driven by ag. But there has been negative commentary from the OEMs on the construction side as well. This quarter, you had CAT, specifically talk about your production being down next year? So, I\u2019m just trying to get a sense for what your expectations are there on the Hydraulics side, specifically as it relates to construction? Sandy Cutler : On construction, the big-big negative has been the China construction story and that leaked into a couple of stories that you just mentioned. And so our view on mining is still down. We think in \u201915 over \u201914. We think the China construction market does not come back in \u201815 either. We think the low-end of the construction market in the U.S. isn\u2019t bad and these are kind of mid-single digit type numbers. But then the ag piece is the piece that hits particularly hard really around the world on the order of kind of a negative 20 at the big ag side. On the industrial side of the business, is not bad. Again, that\u2019s kind of a mid-single digit type business, so I\u2019d say those are the elements. But I think certainly in concert with comments you\u2019ve heard from others that Chinese construction market and ag and mining are not positives as we go into \u201915. Joe Ritchie : Okay. I will get back in queue. Thanks guys. Don Bullock : Thank you very much. Our next question comes from Eli Lustgarten with Longbow Securities. Eli Lustgarten : Good morning, everyone. Sandy Cutler : Good morning, Eli. Eli Lustgarten : Actually somebody has to ask for the obligatory oilfield exposure question and how you're looking at it and you tie it to the electrical businesses? You gave us a joint three to five. Are we really looking at gains in EPG and basically ESS being flat to down in revenues, is that sort of the way you are thinking of that? Sandy Cutler : Let me deal with oil first. Trying to be precise on oil is a little bit of a rolling dice currently. Clearly, last time we all talked about this, oil was $20 to $30 higher than it is now. And so for Eaton, it is sort of a 6% number in terms of our oil and gas exposure. And so it's another one of those five to six end markets that we have many of and is one of our advantages of being kind of broadly spread across a lot of end markets. Our view is, it really does matter whether you're upstream, midstream or downstream and as we've indicated in a couple forums, we are predominantly downstream. We think the biggest immediate impact is an upstream, particularly in terms of being on onshore upstream and I think most people have seen that impact already starting to hit. We think the downstream impacts are more likely to be felt in the second half of the year than the first half of the year. But having said all of that, our thinking is that you have to be thinking there's a 20% to 25% impact in kind of the oil activity that's out there. And so, I'm sure you're working your calculator at this point, the 6%, about a $1.3 billion for Eaton. I save you a couple of keystrokes there. And we think that the strict oil and gas impact is sort of a 20% to 25% reduction. Now having said that, I think the piece that many people have missed is that there are whole bunch end markets that lower oil and gas actually help our customers and our business. And I think when you look at the light vehicles or the truck market, or the aerospace market, or portions of the construction market those are all aided by it. So it is not a net-net for Eaton, 25% of $1.3 billion. But all that\u2019s in our guidance for this year to the best that we've been able to approximate at 20% to 25% type impact on the direct revenues net area. Now, coming back to your second question, Eli and I\u2019d address the oil one, which is this issue of do we expect to see growth in ESS this year? Yes, we do. And so we expect to see growth on both sides of the way we have split our electrical business for reporting of both the products in the ESS business. Typically, the ESS business always starts with a weaker fourth quarter and when you think about major construction activity and all one has to do is look out the window where most of us are located right now and you see what\u2019s lying on the ground, which is what ties up construction projects this time of the year. But we do expect growth on both. But because the power quality market is in the ESS, the big three phase portion is that it\u2019s probably going to grow little less quickly than the EPG side will. Eli Lustgarten : Great. Thank you. Don Bullock : Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse. Julian Mitchell : Hi. Thanks. Just a question on the balance sheet usage, I guess, you have said last year that the real scope to use it comes in second half of \u201815. You spend $650 million on the buyback, actually the last six months. So what's left vis-\u00e0-vis that billion dollars in the second half or is your view changed on kind of appropriate leverage levels? Rick Fearon : No our views -- thanks for the question. Our views have not changed on the appropriate leverage levels. And I think you recall, we said is by the middle of 2015, so end of June that we\u2019d be in a position to share with investors more specific plans on what our next capital allocation plans would be. We said that we thought it would be a mixture of both repurchase and potential acquisitions. We want to get little closer to that time and really see what the relative merits of one of the other tend to look like. It wasn\u2019t that we were going to actuate in action or take an action on June 30th. But it would be in a position to talk about what we do over the second half of 2015 but that plan continues. We obviously stepped into buy our shares in the third and fourth quarter. When we saw a period of weakness, we remained quite bullish on our forward prospects. And we think the fact that we alone are stepping it by 2% of our shares is an ample evidence of that Julian Mitchell : Thanks. Then my follow-up is just on the overall segment margins. They grew about 40 bps, I think last year, the full year issue at the midpoint, you\u2019re guiding for about 90 bps or so of increase. So if I back out Cooper savings and the restructuring benefits, those I think totaled about 40 basis points. So it looks like you are assuming sort of underlying that core incremental margin very similar to last year. Is that right? And I guess how do you see price and commodity cost affecting that base incremental? Rick Fearon : First, Julian, maybe just a little bit of background. Your numbers are correct. We were 15.3 in 2014, 49, so it was the 40 bps you mentioned. And I think within that we recognized, we had disappointments in two of our five segments last year. We had not hit our original targets in Electrical, ESS or Hydraulics. And so as we look at this year, we try to provide you a little bit of a range for each of these but coming back to direct to your comment, yes, we do expect this year to achieve $150 million in the Cooper integration. Last year, it was 95%. We\u2019ve talked about this $35 million of additional savings that were coming out of the restructuring last year that we did in our industrial sector. And I\u2019d say that when you work your way through that and the ForEx decrementals, I think what you come out is that we\u2019re in the very low 20s in terms of our incrementals this year. And we think that takes into effect, the mixed changes that take place in the business, it takes place -- it takes into effect .We think the uncertainties that are generally out there in this environment, when things are growing relatively slow, it's a little harder to have higher incrementals but that\u2019s our planning at this point. Julian Mitchell : Right. Thank you. Don Bullock : Our next question comes from Ann Duignan with JP Morgan. Ann Duignan : Hi. Good morning. Sandy Cutler : Good morning Ann. Rick Fearon : Good morning. Ann Duignan : Can you talk a little bit slightly about what you are seeing in Europe? We had seen all the attempts to spur activity over there and everybody is kind of got into nothing happening in Europe. I\u2019m just curious as to what you guys are seeing by various country and if there are any bright spots? Sandy Cutler : Yeah. There are few candles burning at full power. I\u2019d see -- what we\u2019ve seen is a lot of confusion. I m sure no different than the inputs you are getting. You see so many confidence number which are up one month and down another. Clearly, U.K. has been one of the strong areas. France has been very troubled. Germany, when you talk, the customers there doesn\u2019t sound as bad as some of the economic data does but somebody is reporting bad numbers. So I\u2019d say at this point, our assumption is obviously it\u2019s going to continue to be a challenged region. There are opportunities to grow there if you\u2019re serving the right market segments. But from an overall region, there is still a lot of challenge to get shaken out during 2015. Ann Duignan : And would you anticipate any pickup in export side of places like Germany just under a weak currency? Rick Fearon : Yeah. Our experience Ann is that it normally takes sort of six to nine months in industrial markets for currency to have significant impacts upon trade flows. Now obviously it\u2019s been falling, the Euro has been falling during the fourth quarter and has really come down obviously very hard here already in the first part of this year, which would lead us to believe that if you\u2019re going to see much of that, it\u2019s going to start to materialize in industrial goods. I\u2019m not talking about consumer goods but in industrial goods, it\u2019s going to be more of a second half story than it\u2019s going to be a first half story. Ann Duignan : And then in that context space, just a real quick follow-up, Sandy, what about competitiveness vis-\u00e0-vis European competitors. Are you seeing any pricing, aggressive pricing in the marketplace and I\u2019ll leave it there? Sandy Cutler : No, we haven\u2019t really seen any change at this point. It\u2019s early as I said in terms of kind of seeing that but of course then you\u2019re going to think about the physical size and you also have to think about the different standards. And so that typically hasn\u2019t been as big an issue on our end markets. Ann Duignan : Okay. I appreciate the color. Thanks. Don Bullock : Our next question comes from John Inch with Deutsche Bank. John Inch : Thanks. Good morning everyone. Sandy Cutler : Morning John. John Inch : Morning. So Sandy and Rick, I believe you talked about the 26% incremental margin read through and now it\u2019s low 20s. And I think you said mix. Is this a project, kind of a larger project issue because I would have though given the environment would be deferral of larger projects. And so far as you got oil tied and not what actually improve your mix yet or is the placeholder just you\u2019re trying to be conservative? I\u2019m really just trying to understand because your volumes are not bad. So why exactly are we sort of three or four points lighter on the conversion? Sandy Cutler : Yeah. We had talked about 26 as it pertained 2014 and \u201815 during the fourth quarter in a number of sessions. We\u2019ve talked about this being a lower 20s number. And so this is very consistent with what our planning had been for \u201815. It\u2019s really a result, John, I would say, just about the fact that as growth has been slower, we just see it\u2019s little harder to get out of those higher incrementals. Some may call as conservative, we think its appropriate and these types have shift a lot of uncertainty around these market places at this point. John Inch : But to Ann\u2019s point, there is no -- that's in this report, you pretty much refuted it. But there is no pricing in electrical or anything else that you\u2019re growing more concerned about? Sandy Cutler : No, it\u2019s not an issue. Let me say a kind of a structural change in terms of how the market set up, no. John Inch : Okay. And then just in terms of, I guess, we did $0.08 of restructuring in the second quarter. You said there is more restructuring coming in hydraulics and then we did obviously the share repurchase. What\u2019s in the guide in terms of share repurchase this year and then the restructuring and what quarter does it fall into? Is there anyway to know that yet? Sandy Cutler : In terms of the guide for the share buyback and you recall that we ended the year around 470 million shares. Our best estimate is and this is consistent with our planning each year is that we try to put into our planning basically buying back shares to offset option dilution. And in many years, that\u2019s been around $100 million. So I\u2019d say that\u2019s probably your best kind of planning number. In terms of the restructuring is that, this year as I indicated that we\u2019re doing work in our hydraulics business in light of all the factors, we\u2019ve talked about. And that\u2019s going to hit in both the first and the second quarter and that was where my comments were that expect margins to be lower than the average in the first half and higher than the average in the second half. John Inch : But in terms of the $0.08, does that -- do you have any sort of -- is it like half that rates split in Hydraulics between the two quarters or is it turning out you just don\u2019t know yet? Rick Fearon : The only reason John we called out a number last year is that we pulled forward restructuring that we haven\u2019t planned at doing in the year after we given out our guidance. Our guidance every year has normal restructuring just part of run on the business and we haven\u2019t broken it out because we really regard that as just a cost of doing the business. And that\u2019s very much this year. And so it\u2019s not different than the total we do in the company every year. You\u2019re just going to hit that segment in a way that you\u2019ll notice it in the first and second quarter. John Inch : Right. So in other words, the second quarter should actually get helped because you\u2019re not calling out specific $0.88. So in theory, you\u2019ve got less restructuring in the second quarter. Is that fair? Rick Fearon : Yeah. I think that\u2019s the fair interpretation, yes. John Inch : Okay. Great. Thank you very much. Don Bullock : Our next question comes from Steve Winoker with Bernstein. Steve Winoker : Thanks. Good morning guys. Sandy Cutler : Good morning Steve. Steve Winoker : Could you just maybe provide a little more clarity on the ESS margin dynamic again? Just refreshing where we\u2019re on pricing mix and freight, some of those issues that you\u2019ve talked about and the sustainability going forward? Sandy Cutler : Sure. I think as many people recall that when we had the poor results in the first half of 2014, we were dealing with three things, some pricing dynamics, some freight issues and some efficiency issues in terms of having had weak levels of bookings. I think what you saw in the second half is we considered those three things largely addressed or cured if you will at this point. So we\u2019re jumping off the second half of last year, now we think in a healthy condition. My comments about how this year would layout is that, we would always encourage people to sort of look at the previous two quarters of bookings as an indicator for what sales are likely to be in the third quarter or the successive quarter.  And because we\u2019ve had two quarters of bookings now, they were flat in the fourth quarter and they were just 3% in the third quarter 2014. That\u2019s going to mean the year is going to start a little slower than if we\u2019ve had a five and seven, the two quarters before as an example. My last comment was that, remember in the seasonality of our businesses for all of the -- the first quarter is always the weakest quarter. And obviously, we get that indication from our $1 overall midpoint of our guidance versus the overall $4.90. But it is particularly usually weaker in the Electrical Systems and Services business because it is a lot of large construction activity that doesn't tend to get kind of put in place as much in the quarter. So that would be I guess the vintage I would give you on thinking about the first quarter there, and all this in our guidance of the $1. Steve Winoker : Okay. And maybe just a little bit of thoughts on the tax side, so I know you\u2019ve already prepped us for the 9% to 11% this year. But as you sort of think now about your visibility of tax rate going forward, how are you thinking about that over a longer term? I mean, should we be confident that we\u2019re in the kind of a reasonable zone assuming no policy changes at this point, or how are you thinking about that? Sandy Cutler : Well. Let me, Steve, give you a little color. First of all, the rate in '14 end up exactly where we thought other than the R&D tax credit, which was reenacted at the end of the year. That\u2019s what pushed it down to 5.2. But if you recall, we've been saying it would be 6. And so we ended up right spot on. For '15 mainly because of the mix issues, the rate is going up to just 9% to 11%. And absent major changes in tax law, it is not likely to change dramatically. It might move a point or two from this 9% to 11%, but it is not likely to move a lot. Now there could be changes in tax law, that's very hard to get one's arms around. As you know there have even been various things moved at recently about that, but absent the changes on the tax code not likely to be big changes. Steve Winoker : Okay. Great. I\u2019ll pass it on. Thanks. Don Bullock : Our next question comes from Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc. Jeff Hammond : God morning, guys. Sandy Cutler : Good morning, Jeff. Jeff Hammond : So Sandy, just back to the ESS, I guess what gives you the confidence that things do improve in the second half. I mean, do we expect these projects to break free? Sandy Cutler : We can\u2019t specifically comment on individual projects per say, but it\u2019s our sense from what we see out there being worked upon, what we\u2019re quoting upon, what if you followed the Dodge reports and activities, said this stuff will start to break loose. We obviously saw that happen last year if you looked at the pattern as well. It always generally looks thinnest about this time a year. But we come back to the non-residential construction, our view in this year came out a little stronger than I think most people thought it would in 2014. And we think this year again that we\u2019re likely to see this to be a mid-single digit type number. The kind of industrial MRO activity is pretty solid through here. And so that\u2019s what it\u2019s based on as our view of non-res being a big influencer and industrial continue to be strong. Jeff Hammond : Okay. And then quick color on oil and gas, is there a way to carve out, how you saw order rates trend at least qualitatively within oil and gas basin businesses? Sandy Cutler : Yeah. We really to-date have seen very minimal impact. We spent a lot of time talking to customers at the multi different levels of the oil and gas industry. And that\u2019s what we say looking forward, we think it's prudent to assume that we\u2019re going to see this kind of 20% to 25% impact, but not much of it has been felt at this point. I do think you see a very different profile between upstream and downstream in terms of both how hard they will be hit and also what the timing will be that you feel this upstream will be a bigger hit and it\u2019s going to happen sooner. The downstream obviously has to be hit to some degree as well, but it's probably going to be out a little bit further. And clearly you\u2019re seeing a lot of announcements thing rolled out here during just a last couple of weeks. So this is a fairly dynamic topic. Jeff Hammond : Okay. Thanks. Don Bullock : Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Nigel Coe : Thanks. Good morning. Just wanted to focus a little bit here on the cash flow and you\u2019ve obviously provided the guidance Sandy. But in terms of pension contributions and cash taxes, can you maybe just provide a bit of color on these two items, please? Sandy Cutler : Sure, Nigel. I\u2019ll ask Rick to get those for you. Rick Fearon : Yeah. In terms of pension contribution, Nigel, we are going to be putting in about $40 million less into our U.S. plan to this year than we did in '14. That obviously is one of the factors that helping cash conversion. Also, we think cash taxes based on our best view of that is likely the difference between cash and book taxes, and it was about $140 million difference in '14. But we think that that will likely be about half that in '15. And so those are two of the factors that are improving our cash conversion. But, frankly, and even bigger factor is that our working capital consumed about $260 million of cash in \u201914 and we expected to be about neutral in \u201915. And so those are the three big elements that improve the cash conversion ratio in \u201915. Nigel Coe : And then what\u2019s driven that dramatic improvement in working capital? Rick Fearon : Well, first of all, sales are suppose to be or expected to be largely flat and typically with flat sales you wouldn\u2019t expect to see a significant change in working capital. And then secondly, in \u201914, because some of our markets did turn out to be a bit different than we had plan for at the start of the year. We have had a bit more inventory than we had expected. And so it's really those two factors, flat markets plus working down some of the inventories. Sandy Cutler : And one more, if I could, which is obviously, the integration. We did build inventories purposely during 2015, while we\u2019ve been moving this over 20 factories that are part of the integration of Cooper, as we\u2019ve share with you earlier and these schedules have not changed. We expect to have most of that work done by the middle of this year and obviously, it makes good sense to take the safety starts off. Nigel Coe : Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. And just quick one on the Cooper synergies, you mentioned you are on track and \u201915 guidance is in line with your previous guidance 100%. But has the mix between revenues and cost change at all? Rick Fearon : No. There is a same numbers as we showed you last year. They are very close to that. And in our February meeting in New York, I can\u2019t remember whether it was end of February or early March, but the one that occurs right at that time period. Tom will take you through a pretty detailed review of how we\u2019re doing against each of those buckets, both on the cost side and the revenue side. But I don\u2019t think there will be any surprises in that. I think you\u2019ve really be pleased to see the level of achievement. Nigel Coe : Okay. I will leave it there. Thanks very much. Don Bullock : Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Jeff Sprague : On cash flow again, I understand kind of the improvements year-over-year. Rick, it still looks like you\u2019re converting though maybe a touch below 100, which just strikes me, is a bit low given kind of how much amortization there is? Is there some other kind of operational use to cash or something or could you kind of bridge us with the conversion? Rick Fearon : Well, Jeff, we expect that to be right around one maybe at 0.98 maybe at 1.0, but they\u2019ll be right around 1. And in addition to the three factors I mentioned to you, namely the -- we still think that cash taxes are going to be a little bit higher than book taxes. Pension funding is a little bit above pension expense. Working capital, we think will be relatively neutral but we are expecting that CapEx will be about $100 million more than depreciation. And we are capacitating various programs. I have several new products that are being introduced and so those are the major factors that they\u2019ll help you understand how the amortization, which is the amortization of intangibles, which is obviously, non-cash is being offset to a certain extent. Jeff Sprague : Appreciate it. And just a follow-up on oil and gas, Sandy, perhaps, just coincidental, but about 6% of sales is about, how I would size Crouse-Hinds. Is that how you\u2019re defining oil and gas or you kind of parsing down through exposures in Hydraulics and other businesses that would kind of be exposed oil and gas? Sandy Cutler : Yeah. I appreciate the question, Jeff. The Crouse business is not 100% oil and gas. In fact, it\u2019s quite a diversified business. So I think a number of people have the impression that Crouse was 100% oil and gas. Cooper had done a good job and we\u2019ve also taken that franchise into other. And so this is the total, like 6% it is the total of looking across our Hydraulics and our Electrical business, and trying to get a sense for where some of our vehicle businesses maybe impacted there as well. So we take Crouse into a whole variety of other harsh and hazardous applications as well. Jeff Sprague : Thank you. Don Bullock : Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with Buckingham Research. Josh Pokrzywinski : Hi. Good morning, guys. Sandy Cutler : Good morning. Josh Pokrzywinski : First question on price cost as some of these raw materials have come in, when should we start to see that show up in the business, giving natural or financial hazard that you guys use? Sandy Cutler : Yeah. I think the relationship is always, what happens to kind of net, net commodity and price impact and then the number of our markets prices due end up adjusting to what happens in commodity. So we think there will be a very small positive for us this year and it is in our guidance at this point. But you\u2019ve already seen whether you are looking at some of the metals, diesel fuel hasn\u2019t come down as much as, obviously, the traded numbers for WTR at this point. But some of the metals have come down. But those tend to get adjusted fairly quickly in terms of prices in the marketplace. Josh Pokrzywinski : Got you. And I\u2019m assuming you guys would still be able to hold on to the net price in the Electrical businesses where you consume most of that? Sandy Cutler : Yeah. And I think as you can see that our margins, we are expecting to increase this year. Josh Pokrzywinski : And then, just a follow-up on that comment around non-res that you made earlier, Sandy, I think in years past for you guys or maybe a little earlier than the rest on non-res in terms of seeing that recovering your business, probably attributed most of it to more industrial than construction type vertical. If we see some of this oil and gas weakness spill over into other industrial pocket and continue to see construction gets better. Is the push and pull that a neutral or is the construction piece with Cooper now outweigh the more industrial side of electrical? Sandy Cutler : Actually, our balance when we bought Cooper, we became a little less sensitive to non-res because Cooper had a bigger kind of industrial orientation and part of that included oil and gas part of it was just general industrial but we are pretty good. As I said in the couple of different settings, we\u2019re a pretty good surrogate for the overall non-res exposure because we\u2019ve got good participation on each of these segments. So our real interest is in continuing to see that number increase total non-res and that\u2019s the real driver for us more than anyone of the individual segments. Josh Pokrzywinski : Got you. Its helpful. Thanks. Don Bullock : Our next question comes from Andrew Owen with BofA Merrill Lynch. Andrew Owen : Hey, guys. Good morning. Sandy Cutler : Hi, Andrew. Andrew Owen : Just to focus more on agriculture. Do you guys forecast any difference based on the production schedules between the spring selling season and the fall selling season? I guess, what I\u2019m trying to get at a, is there any difference between tractors and combines? And b, are we sort of at a point where we starting to hope that this is the bottom? Sandy Cutler : Yeah. I think our best view on this, we talk a little bit at the end of the third quarter Andrew was that we didn\u2019t believe it was going to be one crop season that was going to define recovery. We thought that based upon past downs, it normally takes two to three crops rotations to kind of get you back to a point and that to us said that we would see all of \u201815 be weak and that \u201816 might start weak. That obviously informs part of our thinking as to why we\u2019re doing additional restructuring on our Hydraulics business as well. So we don\u2019t expect to see a real quick snap back in this regard and it really doesn\u2019t matter whether it\u2019s planting or whether it\u2019s harvesting. The big equipment is getting impacted so your high horse power tractors and combines are both getting hit pretty hard. Andrew Owen : And the second thing just a follow-up on aerospace. It seems that most of the companies that have provided outlook so far are not really baking in a significant recovery in the spares business due to low energy prices. What\u2019s baked into your outlook for your aerospace business particularly in the second half of the year? Sandy Cutler : Yeah. you may recall that our business is -- if I went back four years ago, was a business where 60% of the business was OEM and 40% was aftermarket and obviously, that makes us important. The last couple years we\u2019ve been running at 65% OEM and 35% aftermarket. We do not expect that ratio is going to change in 2015 so that we stay very much at the 65% OEM, 35%, so that means that our aftermarket is not growing at much of a difference than the overall market forecast we have. Andrew Owen : Okay. Terrific. Thank you. Don Bullock : Our next question comes from Mig Dobre with Robert Baird. Mig Dobre : Yeah. Good morning, guys. Sandy Cutler : Good morning, Mig. Mig Dobre : Sticking with Hydraulics, this is the second quarter where you kind of call out a massive difference between distributor and OEM orders. I'm wondering how sustainable is this? And in your experience, does one end market have a tendency to lead the other? Sandy Cutler : I think the biggest piece is really flowing through distribution tends to be more of the industrial and then aftermarket into a couple of these markets. Generally, the change if you're looking for someone who is serving the mobile market, distributor that serves the mobile market, they might be three to six months behind the OEM. But I think in this case, the real dynamic to keep in mind here is think about the end markets. The ag markets is going to be weak, the mining market is going to be weak, the construction market is very regional at this point. And then industrial is pretty good around the world. And that\u2019s the way we are trying to think about it. But again I\u2019d say part of the reason I gave the heading on the businesses when I went through was remember Hydraulics is about 13% of the company. Mig Dobre : Sure that\u2019s helpful. And then for my follow-up may be back to ESS, I remember a couple of years ago, you were setting some margin targets there around 16%. And obviously we are still long ways from that. And I am just wondering how much of the delta your guidance for 2015 versus that target was owed to maybe volume really not being what you expected it as opposed to the Cooper synergies flowing a little bit different than you expected initially? Rick Fearon : I don\u2019t know that I can parse that for you. I think we said at the end of the second quarter last year that with a slower start we had last year that we thought getting to the original targets that we had set the number of years ago for \u201815 would be a taller pot in both our Electrical Systems and Services segment and our Hydraulics areas and that\u2019s indeed I think what\u2019s reflected in our guidance at this point. So I think we are going to have a solid year of improvement again in electrical systems and services this year as we will overall for the company. And that\u2019ll be true in every segment except Hydraulics, where we are saying that the midpoint of that range is actually less than what we achieved this year for all the other reasons I mentioned. Mig Dobre : All right thanks. Don Bullock : The next question comes from Shannon O'Callaghan with UBS. Shannon O'Callaghan: Morning guys. Sandy Cutler : Morning. Shannon O'Callaghan: Hey, on residential the up 15%, I mean another robust outlook there, I mean it\u2019s been sort of a choppy market in some ways. Can you just sell out your thoughts on the optimism there? Sandy Cutler : I think, we still believe when you look at the big issues what\u2019s going to drive the demographics over time and all the home formation numbers tend us -- continue to support a market that\u2019s on the order of 1.5 million starts per year. We are clearly a long way from that still. We\u2019ve seen a lot of activity in after market that\u2019s -- this is the kind of retrofitting and home repair that\u2019s been quite strong. But we are seeing it fairly steady. If you don\u2019t look at the month and you don\u2019t look at the quarter. So if you look at the year, you are seeing a fairly steady recovery in terms of bringing back single-family in the country. Interest rates are still very low. And as you put more money in the pocket of the consumers with lower gas prices, this is one of the areas that is going to tend to be helpful because people have got more money for a mortgage. And so we do think these ties together and it\u2019s an example of one of those areas that is benefited by lower gas prices. Shannon O'Callaghan: And there is obviously a pretty big disconnect with the outlook there and the outlook for utility. I mean, do you see that gap closing at some point? I think you said utility up one. I mean, at some point you would expect utility to kind of follow with those trends you are seeing in residential? Sandy Cutler : Historically, portion of it would, but the utility market\u2019s facing some fairly severe capital challenges currently. And the rate increased market is -- the rate increase environment has not been terrific here in the U.S. So where we see most of the money being spend is really is an improvement of efficiency and then recovering from storms. It\u2019s not been in terms of putting whole new capacity in place. And so that\u2019s the stronger one, I think you can get lot of good information at an institute that speaks right to this issue. Shannon O'Callaghan: Okay. Great. Thanks a lot, guys. Don Bullock : Our next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC. Deane Dray : Thank you. Good morning everyone. Sandy Cutler : Good morning, Deane. Deane Dray : Hey. You\u2019ve given all kinds of good color about direct oil exposure. But you\u2019ve touched on a couple of different times, the benefits and the offsets from lower oil and we just heard you answer the Shannon\u2019s question about residential mortgages. And earlier you zip through all the different businesses that would have a benefit. But maybe just -- just a bit more methodical in terms of what\u2019s in your 2015 guidance in terms of those offsets, fuel lower input cost and maybe is Cooper going to be a benefit? That would be helpful. Thanks. Sandy Cutler : Yeah. We don\u2019t go that down in all of that detail, Deane. I think maybe the way to think about though is what are some of the markets. I talked to resi. We do think this also has an impact obviously in passenger car. And it also has an impact in the mix within passenger car because what you are clearly seeing is a move very quickly back toward larger SUVs and light trucks, which have a higher content fleet than passenger cars do. We do think it affects, what goes on in heavy-duty truck because diesel prices will come down. They haven\u2019t come down as far yet. They\u2019ve been a little sticky in that regard. But that\u2019s going to affect the ability of obviously truckers, their margins and their ability to obviously buy new trucks as well. We think on the aerospace side -- clearly, its depreciation and fuel, those are your two big drivers there again and so we think good for us. So the way we\u2019ve tried to think about this, Deane, is looking at not just the negative in terms of upstream, midstream, downstream impact on oil and gas, but other sufficient points of exposure for Eaton to other markets that will have a benefit. And as a result, we think this is largely a neutral impact for us. But it\u2019s going to lead to some pluses and some of our businesses and obviously those businesses that ship capital equipment into oil and gas. Those are going to be a negative. Deane Dray : And how about Cooper, specifically? Sandy Cutler : Well. Cooper, again, we tend to have it tied to a lot of different contracts. So, we don't tend to make a gain on Cooper when it goes up or down. Deane Dray : Got it. Just last question. You led off with some pretty heavy gains in your LED business, can you separate how much of that is -- is it all retrofits and maybe what inning are we in the whole LED retrofit conversion? Sandy Cutler : It's very different by individual end market, whether it\u2019d be street lighting or parking lighting or indoor retail. We still think that the big piece of the market, both in terms of new installation, as well as retro is the recessed lighting markets that have traditionally been -- think of your commercial office building as well. And that\u2019s where we are just so excited about this WaveStream technology that we\u2019ve got in the market almost two years now and it\u2019s just doing extremely well, in all the various different styles that we have it out and so. But we continue to think there's real potential. We think LED is going to be the technology that really does rule in lighting and we've got some really unique advantages in that regard. And that\u2019s why you are continuing to see us grow at such strong rates. Deane Dray : Thank you. Don Bullock : We have room for one more question today. And that\u2019ll come from Chris Glynn with Oppenheimer. Chris Glynn : Thanks. Good morning. I think you had some on taxes, I think you had some discrete benefits in 2014, moving up the 9% to 11% range. Would you consider that fully normalized or longer-term, is there half more of the mid-teens at this point? Sandy Cutler : Well, Chris, we think the 9% to 11% rate is relatively pure and that it doesn\u2019t really have significant discrete items. Now, as I mentioned earlier, it's always possible as mix continues to shift that perhaps the rate would change a point or two, but we don\u2019t see a sea change in the rate, absent changes in tax regulations. Chris Glynn : Okay. Thanks. And then just on FX, the 4% overall, would you be able to kind of tilt that by segment? Rick Fearon : We generally have -- I think if you look at, where it hit in the third quarter that relative kind of weighting where it hit, that\u2019s going to be a pretty indication. Sandy Cutler : A pretty good indication to think about how it would be next year. It gives you a pretty good exposure for what the U.S. versus non-U.S. kind of load is in each of the businesses. Chris Glynn : Makes sense. Got it. Don Bullock : Thank you all. We\u2019ve reached the end of our call today. We do appreciate everyone\u2019s questions. As always, I\u2019ll be available to address your follow-up question today and later this week. Thank you for joining us. Operator : Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Executive Teleconference. You may now disconnect.",

Welcome to the Eaton First Quarter Earnings Conference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn this conference over to our host, Eaton\u2019s Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Don Bullock. Please go ahead sir. Don Bullock : Good morning. I\u2019m Don Bullock, Eaton\u2019s Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you for joining us today for Eaton\u2019s first quarter 2015 earnings call. With me this morning are Sandy Cutler, our Chairman and CEO; and Rick Fearon, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer. Our agenda today includes opening remarks by Sandy, highlighting the company\u2019s performance in the first quarter, along with our outlook for the remainder 2015. As has been our practice on prior calls, we\u2019ll be taking questions at the end of Sandy\u2019s comments. The press release today from our earnings announcement this morning and the presentation we\u2019ll go through have been posted on www.eaton.com. Please note that both the press release and the presentation include reconciliations to non-GAAP measures. A webcast of this call is accessible on our website and will be available for replay. Before we get started with Sandy\u2019s comments, I\u2019d like to remind you that our comments today will include statements related to the expected future results of the company and therefore are considered forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from those forecasted projections due to a range of risk and uncertainties we\u2019ve described in our earnings release and our presentation. They are also outlined in the related 8-K. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Sandy. Sandy Cutler : Great, Thanks, Don, and welcome, everybody. I'm going to work on the presentation that was posted on our website earlier this morning. I\u2019m going to start on Page 3. I'll give you a moment to get there as titled Highlights of Q1 results. We started the year, I think as you\u2019ve all seen with a solid high-quality quarter, and in spite of, what was obviously, weak economic conditions, I think we've all just seen this morning the 0.2% U.S. GDP growth. And in summary, really our balanced strategy is working. Our balance from a geographic point of view, our balance across our individual businesses and that's what allowed us to deliver what we think is a solid first quarter. Operating earnings per share of $1.01 was a penny above our guidance, about $0.03 above consensus. And when we look through the individual pieces, the top line was just marginally weaker, a split about half between physical volume and additional FX impact. You've seen in our guidance that we now things that the FX full-year impact will be larger than we thought it would be when we started the year and I'll comment more on that in just a minute. We continue to do, I think, a very strong job of controlling our corporate expenses. They were down about a penny. And our tax rate came in closer to 8% versus the midpoint of our guidance for the full-year of 10%. And that accounted for about $0.02. So overall we think a very strong quarter in spite of some bumps out there in the economy and think off to a good start for the year. Our sales were $5.2 billion, down 5%. When you curve that apart, organic growth of 1%, and then this larger impact of FX of negative 6%. Our segment margins came in right where we thought they would be, 14.6%, up from 14.5% a year ago, down from the 15.9% in the fourth quarter, but as I said, in line with our expectations for the first quarter, which is normally a seasonally weaker quarter for us. We did repurchased $170 million of our shares, about 2.4 million shares. You'll recall that last year we had repurchased 650 million shares or about 2% of our outstanding. And our Cooper integration is right on track. You\u2019ll recall that this year we\u2019re counting on $150 million of incremental synergy profits compared to 2014. And in the first quarter, we did achieve $29 million. So we are on track and I'll talk more about that as we go through the two electrical segments. If you turn to Page 4, just a quick summary overall of the financial results. You see the comments in the light green box in the lower hand corner about organic growth versus Forex. You\u2019ll also I think get a sense looking at the sales number. Obviously a decrease in sales but obviously was positive organic growth. I think you\u2019ve probably digested most of the numbers on this page, so I'm going to recommend we turn onto Page 5 and start with an overview of the performance of our individual segments. Let's start with the electrical products segment. Significant. Obviously it\u2019s about 33% of the total company revenues. Sales were down 2% from last year. And if I could refer you to start here, you\u2019re looking at the light green box in the lower left hand corner. Organic growth was up 4%, very solid again. You\u2019ll recall it was up 5% in the fourth quarter. Clearly we see a big impact of Forex here at negative 6% and that sort of results on the overall down 2%. In terms of the booking activity, very strong bookings once again, up 5%. You'll recall in the fourth quarter, they were up 4%. And the story is much the same as we shared with you over the last couple of quarters. The strength was in the Americas, where we were up 7%, and then weaker outside the U.S. We were particularly pleased - and you will hear this as we talk about many of our businesses. The quarter started quite weakly in January and February. We commented on that when we were in New York at our meetings then. And we were very gratified obviously that the months ended strongly in March. So you'll see strong bookings results in a number of our businesses. And I think that\u2019s parallel to what we were seeing in the economy generally with the slow January and February and then quite a recovery in the month of March. If we think about markets, we\u2019re continuing to see real strength in the residential and non-residential construction markets, particularly strength in lighting, where again we were up very strongly at 16% this quarter, so a very strong quarter. Also have seen some rebound in our businesses in our electrical businesses in Latin America and Canada. The weakness in the U.S. has been around industrial. And I think you have heard that from a couple of companies that there seems to be a little bit more of a malaise on industrial spending. In Asia-Pacific, as the mentioned conditions continue a little weaker mixed country by country. And Europe is still caught and waiting for the recovery really to occur. I did want to comment on the margin. You see the margins at 15.7%, actually below last year's 16.2%. And obviously there, there are a couple of things going on here that I wanted to provide some insights to you. The volume is down and we shared with you this year that we thought our incremental or decremental will be on the order of 20%. We did achieve about half of that synergy savings and remember the synergy savings of $29 million is made up of $24 million of cost and $5 million our profits that come from higher sales. So what you would see on this line is really the half of the $24 million or positive $12 million. And what was offsetting it was actually embedded exchange of about negative $10 million. And this has to do with product made in the U.S. that is then used in Canada. And typically you heard us talk about our practice as being to manufacturing on the currency, clearly the drop in the Canadian dollar has not had quite the highlight that the euro and the Brazilian reals have, but it did impact us. We've been able to - as we\u2019d comment a little later on it, to put mechanisms in place that we think solve this in the second quarter. But it did hit us in both this segment and then you'll see also in the electrical systems & services. In spite of that, we made our full guidance. Then the last would be is that we've had a little bit of negative mix. And here we think that recovers full-year. We've not changed our overall guidance. And so I'll be glad to talk more about that as we get to questions. If we move to the electrical systems & services segment. This particular segment is about 29% of the company\u2019s revenues. You'll recall, we had as you see sales down some 5%. If you look down to the lower left hand corner, you'll see that Forex is the big contributor to that, although organic sales were down about 1%. You'll recall last year we talked quite a bit about the fact that the way to think about this segment is to look at bookings in the previous couple of quarters are good indication of what you'll see in shipments, because this is a backlog business. And you\u2019ll recall in the fourth quarter bookings were flat - in the first quarter, they were flat. A little different regional participation here that the real strength here was in APAC, with the rest of the regions; America flat, Europe down, Asia-Pac up. And the business that really was up for us in Asia-Pacific was the large three-phase power quality market shipping into large datacenters, and we had a particularly successful booking quarter in that regard in Asia. Very pleased with the margin performance. Obviously stronger than a year-ago, even though the volumes were lower. And we also were offsetting some Canadian embedded exchange problems here, and you see the benefits coming through of about $12 million of synergy cost benefits in this segment as well. If we switch to the hydraulic segment. Again, roughly about 13% of the company sales, down 15%. If the organic pressure has not been enough and obviously you see it\u2019s 9% in this quarter. It was 2% last quarter negative. The Forex impacted obviously hit this segment pretty hard as well of negative 6%. So overall volumes down 15%, margins at 10.1%. We did, as we had shared with you, we are doing restructuring in this business in light of the end-markets. We can talk more about that later. But the way I'd have you think about the restructuring is that in light of the magnitude of the down wraps in these end-markets, we will have restructuring expense in every quarter as we go through this year and it'll be on about the same level as we had this year, basically taking somewhere between a point and point and half out of margins in every quarter as we go through the year. If we talk about bookings. Bookings down 18%. I don't think the OEM news is probably noteworthy in terms of this is not tremendously different experience that we've been seeing over the last several quarters. But you'll recall in the fourth quarter, our distributor orders were actually positive and they were negative in this quarter. And what we are seeing is the roll-through in the distribution of some of these end-markets we\u2019ve talked about, oil and gas, Ag. Both of them - we serve some of the smaller OEMs through distribution in those marketplaces. That's where we see the weakness in distribution. We see strength in other areas in terms of construction, vocational vehicle, some of the marine markets and then kind of flattish conditions in industrial. But I think really what we're seeing here is the continued roll-through of negative oil and gas and negative Ag investment. As we go outside the U.S, the story is very much the same in terms of the weakness in the global agricultural markets. And the China construction equipment market really does not show much signs of improvement at this point. So conditions not terribly different than we've been talking about, except for we\u2019re starting to see the roll-through in the distribution side. And that's why you'll see we've taken our guidance down in terms of the margin in this business, and I\u2019ll talk also a little bit about more negative outlook in terms of end-markets here. The good news as we turn to page as this is being made up for by the performance in our aerospace segment, again one of the balanced - benefits of balance for Eaton. Flat sales. Profits up 24%. Again, we are quite pleased with the organic sales here. If you look at the lower left hand corner, 8% positive organic sales. That followed 9% organic last quarter, being offset by the divestitures that you\u2019ll remember that we divested in the second quarter of last year and then negative Forex. If we look at the bookings, maybe a little caution though when we look at the 1%, but we still think the conditions are quite strong. Generally, we saw that some of the placements from the commercial transport segment within commercial weren\u2019t quite as strong during this quarter. As we\u2019ve seen them, we remained void however by the forward-looking line rates which we have from all our OEMs, which are continuing to expand. So we think that's fairly temporary. The military side was down in this quarter, but the aftermarket strong, and we are pleased about this continuing aftermarket booking, particularly on the commercial side where we've seen it pick-up during the last three quarters now. And finally, if we can move to Chart 9, our vehicle business, about 17% of the company. Sales down 4%. But again if you look to the small green chart in the left hand corner, organic up 4%. You\u2019ll remember last quarter organic was up 8% percent, so continued strong performance offset by, not only euro but here you see the big impact of the Brazilian currency, down 8%. And so overall, the overall business down 4%. Profits helpfully up 9%. And our outlook remains much the same as you've heard us talk about here in North America, where we continue to think that this year's Class-8 build forecast would be about 330,000 units. It's pretty well balanced half in the first half and half in the second half in terms of our outlook. We continue to think the backlog is healthy and supports that. Good strength in the light vehicle markets here. But further weakness in the South America vehicle and agricultural equipment markets, not unlike I think you\u2019ve heard from a number of other companies and that's why we\u2019ve actually lowered our growth outlook for the full-year in terms of these markets. It's all based on the South American weakness. If we move to Chart 10. As I said that economic conditions started a little weaker in 2015. We think we've had very strong margin performance in aerospace and vehicle that helped to offset some of the weakness on the hydraulic side. The overall 3% bookings improvement, when you put the two electrical sectors together, is encouraging to us particularly the pace in March. On the other side, clearly we're seeing continued weakness in hydraulics. And we\u2019re pleased we\u2019re able to achieve 10 basis point improvement in our margins and only 1% organic growth increase. And our decision to go ahead and repurchase $170 million of shares, I think continues our pattern of opportunistic purchases. If we turn to Chart 11. Just a quick recap of our expectations of organic revenue. You'll recall that our guidance, when we talked with you at the beginning of the year in total for the company was 3% to 4%. It's now 2% to 3%. And really where that change has taken place is the biggest changes in the hydraulics markets, where we had started this year thinking they would be somewhere between zero and negative 2%. You could see based upon weaker conditions in the U.S., Europe and Asia, we think it's likely to be more now in the order of negative 2% to negative 4%. No change in aerospace. Vehicle has come down from 5% to 7%, to 3% to 5%. That\u2019s all based upon the continued negative outlook in South America. No change in EMEA or North America. And then electrical is down just one point from where we started the year. And that's really based on a little bit more tepid growth in Asia. No real change in the U.S. or Europe outlooks at this point. Turning to Page 12. I commented a little bit on this, and you'll recall that when we gave our guidance this year, we talked about 20% incrementals and decrementals. That was based upon this economic outlook that I talked little bit about, slow global growth, challenges particularly in Europe and Latin America, hydraulic market downgrades and FX pressure. And so you\u2019ll see here is that we have not changed our overall margin performance. We came in where we expected to be in the first quarter. We\u2019ve strengthened our outlook in aerospace based upon the very strong performance in the first quarter and our expectations of that continuing on a pretty steady rate through the balance of the year. And then we\u2019ve lowered hydraulics down a point in light of the weaker start this year and where we think the markets are likely to be this year without any recovery. Moving to Page 13. A couple of quick points about our guidance. This is our first guidance we\u2019re providing for the second quarter, $1.10 to $1.20 operating earnings per share. Obviously the midpoint of that is $1.15. You all know, for those of you who followed Eaton for sometime that we have a pretty standard 5% seasonal revenue increase between Q1 and Q2. On a physical volume basis, that's again what we expect this year. We think it's supported by what we\u2019re seeing in our markets. Offset by probably a negative point of additional FX compared to the first quarter of this year. So that nets you out in sort of 4% net of FX top-line. We do expect to get about a point improvement in our margins, again pretty usual for us between the first and second quarter. And because the tax rates started a little lower this year and we\u2019re maintaining our full-year guidance of 9% to 11%, we think that the second through fourth quarters are likely to be more in the area of 10% to 11% in terms of tax rates. Full-year. We revised our guidance to $4.65 to $4.95, pretty much in line with current consensus that\u2019s been out there, $4.82. And a reduction of 2% from our original guidance this year is primarily due to higher negative FX impact. You'll recall we started the year thinking that FX would negatively impact our top-line on the order of about $900 million. We think it's closer to $1.2 billion at this point. And that really is the explanation for the change. If we flip to Page 14. We\u2019ve tried to give you a quick summary of our guidance. We\u2019ve provide you with the February, all the points I just made about our April guidance and you can see where the changes are down one point and organic growth down $300 million of additional FX pressure. No change in the segment margins, but down in hydraulics, up in aerospace, again the benefit of our breath. About a $20 million reduction in the collection of our corporate expenses that we show you there. And then that obviously leads the $0.10 reduction or 2% reduction in our overall guidance for the year. I think significantly if you look at the operating cash flow number, you'll recall that we've not change those numbers, still $2.7 billion to $3.1 billion. They do represent a 15% increase from last year, some $2.5 billion, $3 billion in operating cash flow. So we remain quite bullish in our cash outlook and that really sets up the discussion we\u2019ll have with your about capital structure following our second quarter\u2019s earnings release. So if we move to 15, our summary. Again we think a very solid first quarter. We did see a necessary acceleration in March, recovering from the weaker January, February. I mentioned the FX that we think now will impact our top-line by about negative 5%, again the trade-off of aerospace versus hydraulic margins. And then if we think about this overall guidance of $4.80, it does represent 3% growth over last year. But within that, I think other factors we\u2019ve talked with many of you about this year is that we are anticipating obviously this $1.2 billion negative impact of Forex, which is about $0.26 full-year negative for us that's higher obviously than what we outlined to you in January. And then about a negative $0.17 for the tax rate. So there is about negative $0.42 from those two items that are embedded in our year-to-year comparison. And that negative $0.43 is compared to the $0.36 that we had outlined for you in the first quarter. And then once again, the Cooper integration savings very much on target. Obviously it's one of the reasons that our profitability is higher in the second half than the first half because you'll recall back to Tom Gross\u2019s presentation in February, we are finishing out many of the manufacturing plant moves and that's the next big piece really, the savings that come in and I am very pleased to report those plans and actions are very much on plan at this point. So with that, Don, why don't we open things for questions? Operator : Very good. [Operator Instructions] Don Bullock : Before we begin our Q&A session today, I see that we have a number of individuals queued up with questions. Due to our time constraints for an hour today, I would ask that you please hold it to a single question and a follow-up. Thank you very much in advance for your cooperation, so we can get to as many of these questions as possible. Our first question is from Scott Davis with Barclays. Scott Davis : Hi, good morning guys. Trying to sell get a sense of if the strength in March continued through April, and what would you attribute that the strength in March to, given the week start to the year, was it inventories finally got low enough, or there was a bit of a restock, or do think there is some real macro acceleration, particularly things like non-res? Sandy Cutler : Yes, we don't have April results yet, Scott. But I guess our thoughts about March is that we really saw a fairly weak order patterns in January and February. Hard to know whether those are attributed to the weather, whether they were attributed to concerns about port strikes or all of the above. We\u2019re pleased. What we did see was a very strong activity in March. And I don't want to overplay that because as you normally find that the third months in the first quarter is disproportionately important. And so we see some of that pattern every year. But it was stronger really across the board in terms of end-market segments that we saw within those businesses. And we're off to, I would say a reasonable start from what we can tell in April, but we don't have final numbers yet. Scott Davis : Understood. And I don't know much about the hydraulics business, but when I look at your total year for cash negative 2% negative 4% coming off of negative 9% this quarter. I mean that does imply maybe you expect a real improvement back-end loaded improvement of somewhat. Is that - I'm asking if it\u2019s a realistic assumption? I guess when I look at it, I\u2019m a little skeptical. Maybe you can make us feel a bit better about that? Sandy Cutler : Yes, I think the issue again that what we are seeing is that the - we have seen a fair number or most of the weakness come out of the OEM side. That's not a typical when the hydraulics market is going through a change in cycle. So most of the bookings that we are receiving now are bookings that are coming in for the short-term, kind of one through three months. It feels a lot like what we saw when we saw the inflection changes back in 2008, 2009. We\u2019ve looked pretty hard at this forecast. We think it's a realistic forecast at this point, but we\u2019re not forecasting. This business will look pretty flattish as we go through this year. There will be some improvements in margins that will come from the restructuring we are doing. But we obviously took a point out of our margin guidance for the year in light of the fact that we don't see this rebound really happening at this point. Scott Davis : Okay, good answer. Thanks guys and good luck. Don Bullock : Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Joe Ritchie : Thank you and good morning. So my first question I guess just would be on the aero margins this quarter. Was there anything specific that really drove the strength, the 320 basis points? I see that you guys have a step-down as the year progresses. And I'm just curious like what was really underlying the strength in that business this quarter? Sandy Cutler : Well, again if you look back over the last portion of last year, our business was strengthening as well and so that we've got a business that we think is being very well run. There always is the two kind of issues that are going on in any aerospace business. There is the current shipments and then there is a development project or new order project work. And I think the team is doing a good job on both of those. So I wouldn\u2019t point out any one issue of being unusual. We had good order placements all last year. You're seeing the commercial side of the market continue to be quite strong. The defense side hasn't been as bad as some people had forecasted. Now, that has a lot to do with the specific programs we are on. But I think we are also doing a better job of managing our new development projects. And so that has helped to margin structure as well. So while we\u2019re saying that we think the margins will be fairly consistent through the end of the year, I think that's a reflection that we\u2019re comfortable with the market outlook and I think our teams are doing a really good job on managing these big projects. Joe Ritchie : Okay, fair enough. And maybe my follow-up. Just a question, Sandy, when you're walking through the puts and takes on electrical products this quarter, clearly organic growth was good. It seems like you had $12 million in synergies that came through that was a positive. FX was a negative $10 million and yet operating profit was down despite the organic growth that came through. And so I'm just curious, was there something about your mix this quarter on why you weren\u2019t able to grow profit on the electrical product side this quarter? Sandy Cutler : Yes, and I did mention that there was a negative mix. And I think most people know that the lighting industry doesn't have quite the margins that some of the component businesses that we\u2019re in do. And I mentioned our lighting business was up some 16% in the quarter again doing very, very well. So we're very pleased with that business. But it didn't have a positive mix impact upon us. Joe Ritchie : Okay, great. Helpful. I'll get back in the queue. Sandy Cutler : Yes, thanks. Don Bullock : Our next question comes from Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc. Jeff Hammond : Good morning guys. Just back on that FX transaction dynamic with Canada. Can you quantify what that was in the quarter? And then I think Sandy you mentioned - Rick could maybe clarify what you're doing going forward to kind of pull that out of the dynamics? Rick Fearon : I mentioned it was about $10 million in the product segment. And it's less than that and... Jeff Hammond : It\u2019s around $5 million. Sandy Cutler : And the situation, Jeff, is that as you know we largely neutralize FX by manufacturing and selling in the same region, where we have an intra-region exposure, we attempt to put hedges in place to neutralize that. But you\u2019re limited by uncertainty about volumes and in some cases by regulatory limitations. And in the case of the flow to Canada, it's really the Cooper product flowing to Canada. They had not had a program in place because of some regulatory changes that occurred towards the end of last year. We weren\u2019t able to hedge as much of that Cooper flow as we normally would. But the good news is that we now have gotten through those flows what we hedged starting into second quarter. So this is an issue that should go away as those hedges works their magic [ph]. Jeff Hammond : Okay, great. And then, can you just, Sandy, give us an update assessment of what you're seeing in your energy facing businesses relative to kind of how you're thinking about it? And maybe just sliding one more, just give us a free cash flow number for the quarter? Sandy Cutler : Our view on the oil and gas business is very similar to what we describe you upfront. Now you may recall, our forecast for this year was that it might have a little bit more pressure than some others had outlined early in the year. But the way we think about it is oil and gas is about 6%. It's the same number I told you in the last quarter. And that you really have to think about this in terms of sort of the upstream, midstream and downstream exposure. The majority of Eaton\u2019s exposure is downstream, approximately 70%. And so when we look through all of this, we've said we thought that the upstream onshore would be on the order of 35% impact negative this year. Offshore would be closer to something around 25%. Now you\u2019ve got to take all of these with - it's a plus or minus 5% off of those. And there is no accounting accuracy to forecast out in a market like this. And we think the downstream gets affected a little less. It\u2019s more on the order of about 20%. So when you put that all together, you come up with something that probably says that we see something on the order of 20% pressure in terms of oil and gas for Eaton this year. That indeed as we've spend a lot of time in a lot of regions in the world talking to OEMs, users, distributors, EPCs seems to be pretty well laying out in terms of the activity as we see it. We've also indicated, Jeff, that we think that some of the order weakness that people will see this year will manifest itself next year in terms of shipments. So a lot of the shipments impact will occur kind of in the second half and then into next year, because there are a lot of projects that are underway that they are going to complete versus just stopping those in half way through it. So that's our view of oil and gas at this point. It spelt differently in distribution than it is in terms of the OEM side as well and little different timing. Rick Fearon : Jeff, you asked about operating cash flow and free cash flow. Operating cash flow, before the pension contribution, was $300 million. We made $223 million pension contribution both, U.S. qualified as well as the non-qualified portions and the international portions in the quarter. And CapEx was just over a $100 million. Don Bullock : Our next question comes from David Raso with Evercore. David Raso : Hi good morning. Questions on the electrical outlook. Your order growth accelerated a bit, but you lowered the organic sales outlook. Can you flush that out for us a little bit? Sandy Cutler : Yes, it really is a mix as we look around the world, David. I guess I mentioned the change. We've not changed the U.S. That is where we continue to see strength and did last year as well. We are seeing conditions to be a little bit choppy in Asia. And clearly China is I think the question in many people's mind as to exactly what the growth will be and in what segment. Of our view is that it is slower than we had originally anticipated there. So that's the primary change. So we are continuing to do quite well in the U.S. and that is the area that obviously it\u2019s the best house in the neighborhood currently. David Raso : And you made a comment about Europe not necessarily seeing a recovery yet. Is there any signs at all in the order book, or is it just status quo and it's just optimism at this stage? Sandy Cutler : No, we've actually seen on the product side - speaking to electrical, we've actually seen there a slight uptick. We're seeing orders up kind of on the order 2% to 3% there. We've not seen it on the larger kind of system side at this point in Europe. So maybe a little bit more of a maintenance spend, if you will. I know we're seeing a lot written about with the euro dropping that we are going to see MLM [ph] or machine builders start to be more competitive. We've not yet seen that yet. Our, I guess experience with that is that it general takes more than a couple of months. It's usually six months to a year of these kind of basic currency changes to see substantial changes in the export patterns. And so that may still be out ahead of us. David Raso : And lastly, the CEO succession planning with the mandatory retirement. When should we expect an announcement regarding that? Sandy Cutler : Yes, we don't have a further update for you. The board will make that announcement when they are ready to make the announcement. David Raso : Okay. I appreciate it. Thank you. Don Bullock : Sure. Our next question comes from Shannon O'Callaghan with UBS. Shannon O'Callaghan: Good morning, guys. Sandy, you mentioned the recovery sort of paralleling what you're saying in the economy. I guess fair amount of the economic data has been choppy too. Can you maybe just flush that out a little bit? Sandy Cutler : So, I think we were hearing during the early part of the year, January and February, people were asking questions when you see a similar weather impact that we saw last year, while it was cold, we didn't have what I\u2019m going to call the devastating ice storms that we had a year ago that really hit that Carolinas in such a big way. And so I think as people got through that, they relaxed a little bit about the full impact of the weather. We obviously had the port strikes that went on that affected some portions of the economy. But I think it's clear that January and February were weak, and we saw those months not being spectacular months I'm talking to the U.S. in terms of activity. The second issue that's a little different this year than a year ago, and all of you are well aware of this is that Chinese New Year was really prolonged period of time this year. Some people talk about it being almost five weeks long. I think a reflection effect that again that governments and companies took advantage of the holiday time to simply extend it to try to eat up some of the weak economic conditions. But then March obviously came on much stronger. And I think that's somewhat the recovery for maybe people under-spending in January and February. Having said that, I think having the benefit of like four hours or three hours since the GDP numbers came out this morning, I don't think many people were surprised that the U.S. GDP came out that this fraction of what was already a pretty dollar forecast of 1% and it came out obviously you all thought as well at 0.2%. That's not a whole lot of growth in the economy that\u2019s supposed to be the one that\u2019s most ambulant in the period of time. So I think again it simply says we\u2019re in a period of time of relative moderate global growth. And that's why these self-help stories such as the $150 million of incremental savings from the Coopers deal are particularly important. Shannon O'Callaghan: Okay, great. Thanks. And then just on the strength in three-phase power quality in Asia. Should we think about that as just kind of nice win for you in a tough market, or are you actually seeing market conditions get any better there? Sandy Cutler : Yes, there is a lot of dataset - datacenter building being talked about in Asia. It says a number there being let is not still a very high number. So I think it's a reflection that we are doing quite well in a market that's not going growing as quickly as it was couple of years ago. Shannon O'Callaghan: Okay, great. Thanks. Don Bullock : Our next question comes from Ann Duignan with JP Morgan. Ann Duignan : Hi, good morning. Can we go back to hydraulics for a moment? I have to admit that I share Scott Davis\u2019 skepticism. Given that 50% of that business is either energy, agricultural or construction/mining, where exactly are you expecting the improvements, given what we saw in Q1 and where the orders are? Sandy Cutler : Yes, and again our forecast is pretty flat in this business. So we are not expecting from a shipment point of view substantial improvement during this year. We are continuing to receive orders, but if you go back and look at the part of the challenge we\u2019re looking at the order comparison as we go back and look at orders, they were still relatively good in the early part of the last year. We\u2019re living off the orders of the second year. So we're much more consistent with the order patterns in the second half of last year in our shipment patterns. So we're not suggesting a big recovery. Neither are we suggesting a huge recovery in margins. We do think margins will be marginally better in the second half than the first half, but primarily as the result of the restructuring we're doing. Rick Fearon : And if you just look, Ann, I might add that the growth rates - the comparisons get markedly easier as you go through the year, given that the business that started to substantially decline sales-wise in the second of last year. Ann Duignan : Yes. I appreciate that primarily in the Ag space but okay, I'll take it offline maybe. Just a follow-up then on your half forecast. Sandy I think you mentioned in your comments that you now expect the 330 build to be roughly 50-50 first half - second half? Sandy Cutler : Correct. Ann Duignan : And last quarter that was most skewed seasonally to first half versus second half. What\u2019s change there or is it just nuance? Sandy Cutler : I think it's far more nuance than anything else, Ann. We continue to think this is going to be a very strong year for truck. We aren\u2019t seeing any reasons to choose any differently. That's in NAFTA what we're talking. Ann Duignan : Yes. Sandy Cutler : But we see obviously the more weakness when we get down to Latin America, particularly driven by the real challenges in the Brazilian economy. Ann Duignan : Okay. I'll leave it there. Thanks. Don Bullock : Our next question comes from John Inch of Deutsche Bank. John Inch : Thanks. Good morning everyone. Sandy Cutler : Good morning, John. John Inch : Hi Sandy, do you think that if you kind of look at the way this winter played out, the Northeast and Canada and Midwest had a really tough February. And a year ago we had tough January and March. So just trying to think back to electrical and what happened. Is it possible given sort of end-markets and stocking/destocking that sort of thing that effectively what happened is because March had, call it easier comparison February and wasn't as bad that maybe things that might have been delayed or deferred in February got slipped into the March. I'm just trying to understand if really the March trends you\u2019ve seen are sustainable? Sandy Cutler : Yes, I would say, John, in both years, we really did not see a destocking in one month then a restocking in the other. I don't think that was as much of an issue, because it's hard for distributors to simply destock one month, restock the next. That's normally the way they think. They are trying to now think about spring, is what they are thinking about in March. And what they want to have on the shows for the time period and we think their view is that the non-residential and residential continues to be pretty strong this winter in the areas you just talked about. There wasn't much going on obviously with the weather being bad. We can't put an accounting accuracy to that. That's our best sense. We're trying to do the same thing you are, try to understand with a very, very strong March because it was both on the product side as well on the systems and services side. Does that automatically carryover in the spring? It's a little too early for us to know because generally April is a tough month to read the whole quarter on. May and June become very important in the second quarter. John Inch : I think that's a fair answer. I mean, we know that - and obviously we know non-resi and construction markets are still improving. Here is the sort of the second part of my question. I want to go back to restructuring. I think you had targeted 35% to 40% for the year, and this is going to be weighted to hydraulics and so forth. Your peer competitor in Cleveland, Parker-Hannifin, you sort of listened to their call and their offline commentary and you look at the GDP print this market. Debatably we could almost already be in an industrial manufacturing recession. And I realize each and every company has their own mix and buying your shares and so forth. But my question is, do you have a playbook that you would theoretically - because you did restructuring last year be accelerating restructuring? And if so, what is that playbook or you just sort of not there yet because you don't have enough information? Sandy Cutler : I think maybe a very appropriate question, John, because I think everyone is trying to get a sense, particularly on the industrial side of the economy, so getting away from a commercial construction and getting away from non-res, so what's really happening. And our plan I think as you recall as we outlined it as that this year in our electrical business obviously we are finishing out much of the integration of the Cooper business, and inherent in that is about $40 million, that was in our guidance overall for integration expense of $45 million of work that we're doing there. And so that we have the benefit of still bringing those two franchises together and getting them sized and equipped well for what we think the current environment is. We had said in hydraulics that restructuring would be somewhere between about a point and point and a half impact on margins, and you can obviously calculate that to the kind of number you just mentioned. And that we think that goes on all the way through this year. And so we have a fairly active playbook to your point in place. We have been obviously committed to being sure that we go deep enough to really deal with what is weaker in hydraulics. And we think that is the plan we put in place. We've got different businesses than some of our competitors, but we think we are well sized at this point for the outlook we've outlined for you. John Inch : And Rick, raising debt to repurchase your shares? Is that a new strategy or are you being opportunistic or - it looks like you raised about $170 million of debt? Rick Fearon : Well, we didn't really raised debt. We had a term debt maturity on April 1, which is a pretty unusual date do have a maturity. So we simply took down commercial paper to make that payment and the plan is as we get towards the end of Q2, we would not expect to have any substantial CPE on the balance sheet at the end of Q2. So it was really just, I'd call it a tactical funding requirement, because of the calendar of the term debt repayment. John Inch : Got it. Thanks guys. Don Bullock : Our next question comes from Eli Lustgarten with Longbow. Eli Lustgarten : Good morning, everyone. Sandy Cutler : Good morning, Eli. Eli Lustgarten : Can we talk a little bit questions of what's going on in some of the regions outside the U.S., particularly South America, which is Brazil is a complete mess it looks like, and it really has a big impact probably on hydraulics and vehicle in some of your reporting. And touching on that, can you talk about pricing? Of course those businesses and really around the world of what's happening in price competition at this point? Sandy Cutler : The business that has the biggest impact for us, Eli, in terms of Latin America is our vehicle business. It really - and as we've shared with you, almost 30% of our revenues in vehicle come out of South America in particular. So that's really the focal point for us I guess as we think about that area. And you're right, the Brazilian economy. And we've talked with many of you at great depth about it, our concern over the last couple of years that there were a lot of macro policies that were just kind of end up with a problem and that\u2019s indeed what we've ended up with at this point. So we don't see the likelihood that that economy is going to recover this year. Our own forecast is that the manufacturing IP is going to be negative several points in Brazil this year. It\u2019s a GDP that\u2019s likely to shrink one to two points this year. You don't see that in many countries. And so I think it talks about the challenge over there. And you're right and if you get to the West Coast and a couple of the economies, it looked like promising a couple of years ago, be the Peru or Chile. With the mining pullback, they've obviously been heavily impacted as well. So it is a more difficult region in terms of growth. There are individual product lines and all that were doing well in, but I think you\u2019d have to market as a disappointing region versus ours and many people's thoughts a couple of years ago. Eli Lustgarten : And can you talk about pricing across the businesses. So I mean, it looks like with not much inflation and pricing is getting relatively competitive in some of the electrical businesses and hydraulic businesses? Sandy Cutler : Yes, our net on it - because I guess the way we all think about pricing is our cost versus pricing versus the new products that we are introducing that have got a better price point or better margin point and overall pretty neutral for us this year. We've just taken a pretty deep dive on that across all of our businesses and it's not that conditions aren\u2019t competitive, but I'd say that in terms of impact to our margin is pretty neutral. Eli Lustgarten : All right. Thank you. Sandy Cutler : Yes. Don Bullock : Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with Buckingham. Josh Pokrzywinski : Hi, good morning guys. Sandy Cutler : Good morning. Josh Pokrzywinski : Just a follow-up on the electrical guidance and some of the tweaks to the organic growth there. Sandy, you mentioned Asia being a little bit of drag there and that was the reason for that downward revision, but you also talked about strength in ESS in APAC. So I guess I'm just trying to reconcile the two and where is the weakness, and is there is something in the order book that concerns you, or what's driving that? Sandy Cutler : Yes, I guess I would start again and say recognize these are fine-tunings. They are not what I would call wholesale changes. And so it's a matter of which way we kind of round things. But markets generally were weaker in the first quarter than we had thought they would start. And I think that's really across many of our businesses, not just electrical or hydraulics. And I think you'll see that in the GDP data, not only here but elsewhere. At the same time, there are a number of encouraging numbers that are out there as well. I think some of the news residential in the U.S., you just saw new ABI data this morning which is never conclusive but at least is pointing at a little bit more positive direction. And so I wouldn't overreact one way or the other on, and I think it's more of fine-tuning. I think one of the pieces of data I think everyone is struggling a little bit right now is the non-residential information which you saw as part of GDP this morning, showed a negative number in terms of non-res investment. We actually think non-res construction was probably up in the order of something around 3%-ish in the first quarter, and we think it will be somewhere between there and 5% when we look at the full-year. So obviously that means we think it picks up as you get into the better seasonal portions of this year. Josh Pokrzywinski : Okay, I guess I meant specifically Asia sounded like it was both, better and worse? Sandy Cutler : Let me come back to Asia. On Asia, I would say it's really an issue of China. We think China is continuing to slow. That doesn't mean it's going negative. It means its rate of growth is slower, and that does have an impact in terms of large projects in our power distribution business. Josh Pokrzywinski : Okay. And then just one more follow-up on the vehicle business. Clearly some headwinds that you guys are seeing in Brazil on the Ag on truck side, but keeping the margin assumption there unchanged. I understand it's a pretty high mix business for you guys, so is there more that you're doing on restructuring or some other benefits that's offsetting that? Sandy Cutler : No, I'd say that we think 200 basis point expansion in margins, so when volumes are coming down it really speaks to the productivity and the costs, but it's not wholesale restructuring. You'll recall last year we did some restructuring in our vehicles business. We had said that would provide some benefit this year, but as not as much about current year restructuring as it is about the benefits that we got from last year. Recall there is about $35 million of benefit that flowed into 2015 from restructuring actions that took place in our industrial sector, and vehicle was one of those segments we spent the money in last year. Josh Pokrzywinski : Yes. Thanks guys. Don Bullock : Our next question comes from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Christopher Glynn : If you take a look at the oil and gas that you described, I think down 25%, and please correct some of my assumption if they were off, but I think about 90% of that's going to land in ESS. And it's pretty good mix to - you have solid margin expansion in the outlook. So I'm just wondering how you're factoring in that mix impact and maybe FX is actually a positive to ESS margin, I don't know. Sandy Cutler : Chris I\u2019m sorry, I missed the first part of your question because there was another comment on the line and we couldn't hear you. Christopher Glynn : Okay, yes. The oil and gas, I think you summed those down 25% overall. And I'm placing about 90% of that in ESS as good margin mix too. So I'm just wondering how that mix impact would square with the margin guidance for pretty good improvement? Sandy Cutler : Yes, I would say firstly, it's 20% not 25%. They were thinking things will come down this year, and actually our oil and gas exposure goes across - everyone except for aerospace, it's less than vehicle but it's not an aerospace but it is in both our electrical and hydraulics, and it's not disproportionately in one electrical versus the other, because we sell a fair amount of standard comp, things that we call standard components and oil and gas as well as systems and services. So that's pretty well spread across. And then the upstream, you can obviously think of that as being upstream onshore is fracking and that tends to be a fairly heavy use of hydraulics equipment. Christopher Glynn : Okay, thanks. That helps. And then with lighting, I'm wondering about the LED opportunity for Eaton to leverage digital lighting and the low voltage access for data capture in the whole IOT environment? Sandy Cutler : Yes, we are really very proud of the additional investments Eaton has made in the business we\u2019ve purchase from Cooper in our lighting business. LED is now over half of our total lighting sales. In some categories, it\u2019s as high now as 70%. We're really pleased. In this last quarter, we've introduced a new product that we call, Night Falcon, which now takes LED into outdoor to architectural lighting. That's traditionally been the prevalence of metal halide and low pressure sodium. And so we're continuing to push those technologies into new areas and there is no question that one of the things we talked about when we bought Cooper was that we like the ability now to bring our ability to manage power for customers into the whole lighting arena as well as our traditional strength in and around controlling and having efficiency in and around electrical motors. And that allows us now to have an even bigger play for people in energy-saving. So yes we are not only thinking out but are successful now at this point and really making that play work for us. The issue about digital lighting digital control, for those of you who've attended a couple of our workshops you\u2019ve seen us talk about where we think that real potential is and that's one of the reasons we are putting more money into this business. Christopher Glynn : Thanks for the color. Don Bullock : Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse. Julian Mitchell : Hi thank you. Just on the electrical systems and service margins. So you didn't have much of an increase off of very low base in Q1. Just wondering in light of the soft bookings maybe Q2 margins are also subdued. So why do you think we should see sort of 100, 150 bps increase year-on-year in the second half, given how bookings are trending? Sandy Cutler : Yes, a couple of things here to think about. Number one is remember about half of our synergies, savings for the Cooper integration fall into each of our two electrical segments. So unlike last year we were about 75% of it felt into products. This year it\u2019s about 50-50. I shared with you the about $29 million of total $150 million was in the first quarter. Obviously you can figure out what the balance has got to be and it gets higher each quarters as we go through the year, because that's when we are finishing up many of the manufacturing consolidations. Secondly Julian, we expect to eliminate actually was $8 million of embedded change, in this particular segment, and in addition to the $10 million in the other. And we expect to eliminate that as we go here into the second quarter. And then there is the benefit of some additional volume that we do expect to see if the non-res portion, particularly in the U.S. continues to strengthen as we go through the year. I would say those are the three primary elements. Julian Mitchell : Thank you. And then my second question just on capital allocation. I think before you talked about maybe having 1.5 billion to 1.6 billion of available to deploy capital through the end of next year. We look at the 170 million. We look at the trailing nine-months spend on buyback. Have you changed your view on sort of optimal leverage, or should we assume that now the available capital deployed at the end of March is now 1.3 billion or so? Sandy Cutler : Yes, Julian we\u2019ll give a fairly complete view on this subject of capital structure as we come out of the second quarter. And so I don't want to get ahead of that discussion, but I think the timing you all recall as we\u2019ve said that we would address capital structure and the elements of capital structure when we get to mid-year and we'll do that at the time that we do our second quarter earnings release. But it's still our expectation that we'll be in a position to share with you and all investors, our updated view on that here in mid-year. Julian Mitchell : Great. Thank you. Don Bullock : Our next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC. Deane Dray : Thank you. Good morning everyone. I know we've covered a lot of ground here. Just if we can go back to the non-res comments and that disconnect between what the GDP indicators are saying some negative spending and your outlook for up 3% to 5%. More specifically, what kind of customer behavior either front log, is there a particular vertical that's feeling a bit stronger that would give you better outlook at this stage? Sandy Cutler : Yes, when we look across, Deane, the preliminary information that was available on strength in non-res, it was pretty well spread across the different segments. And that we see that areas like wastewater, education, healthcare, commercial buildings, even in the light industrial manufacturing has been pretty busy. There is also been some pretty good datacenter activity here in the U.S. And so I'd say those are the areas that we see has been particularly strong. If you get into utility, it tends to be not as strong as some of those other segments. And as I mentioned, the industrial area has been a little bit disappointing as you get into the bigger industrial type of installation. Deane Dray : Great. Thank you. Don Bullock : Our next question comes from Rob McCarthy with Stifel. Rob McCarthy : Good morning everyone. Yes, two questions. One on non-res. I mean, obviously - and the interplay with oil and gas. I think you highlighted that 6% of your overall exposure is oil and gas. Obviously debatably there could be in a larger portion of sales that\u2019s kind of tied to that from the support of data of what's going on in terms of those trends. And Sandy to be clear on the last up-cycle, I do recall that you were talking about non-residential construction in the context of a supportive outlook for energy spending as a whole. So I guess the question I have is, what is the echo effect of oil and gas on non-res, and do you think there is a possibility that if we still continue to see challenging trends here, it could potentially choke off non-res recovery? Sandy Cutler : Yes, we don't see that, Rob, at this point. And I know there was a lot of speculation in the November. December, January time period as to spending or contracting spending in the oil and gas segment have a disproportionate impact upon oil and gas. I think what we've all seen that has not materialized. And we don't believe it will at this point. We think as you go around to many of the major cities, you're seeing fairly active construction going on in those areas. And it's not simply what I would call the oil and gas boomtown, if you will. Clearly if you get out in the areas where there has been a lot of fracking activity, some of the activity that was just at a wild pace and in some of those areas like the Dakotas, that wasn't so much big commercial. It was light commercial and resi has pulled back. And I think that portion has - but it hasn't affected activity in San Francisco or New York or Philadelphia or Atlanta or Chicago and markets where we\u2019re seeing a lot of building activities. So we don't see that having an impact. I think the bigger question really right now is around this discussion around a heavy industrial investment and whether there is a pause in that. And obviously remember that the non-commercial portion of non-res is about half of the non-res market. So that's the piece we've not seen pick-up the so-called really big projects. It hasn\u2019t picked up through this cycle. We didn't see it pick-up in the first quarter either. So we see this portion of the cycle being more of what I'm going to call the light commercial institutional type orientation without the breadth of really big projects that we've seen in the historic rebounce in non-res. Rob McCarthy : And then just as a follow-up, I mean capital allocation obviously is pretty key here for the story and you\u2019re going through a management succession, and you\u2019ve kind of spoken to that ad-nauseam. But if a deal of size, kind of opportunity opened up, how do you think about the management of the company in terms of managing a succession and a large acquisition? Could you conceptually think that could occur, can you walk at the same time in that regard, or do you think it just kind of takes a larger more transformative deal off the table? Sandy Cutler : I think, Rob, as we\u2019ve indicated in numerous forums that there is no one person who makes decision about major strategic alternatives for the company. We've always done that as a team and as a full management team and we have a great depth in that regard. And we've always done that with our board. So I see no reason why if we have the right opportunity and pricing was right, that would not cause us any hesitancy in that regard. But it's always about whether we think we can get the right return for our shareholders. And that's really the determining issue. Rob McCarthy : Well, thanks, and I do like the answers to my questions. Don Bullock : We have time for a couple more this morning. Our next question comes from Andy Casey with Wells Fargo. Andy Casey : Thanks a lot. I just wanted to go back to that one question, and just broaden it out Can you - I'm trying to reconcile U.S. industrial and construction trends. Do you think it's possible for construction improvement to last a few years if industrial falls into persistent declines? Sandy Cutler : Yes, hard to know, Andy, again it's about 50% of the market is just kind of non-commercial. I'd have to go back and look at history actually to say, can we see a period of time when that's been true. I think again remember part of what's in that lower areas is oil and gas and manufacturing. And so I would guess that if you saw industrial go into a steep decline and that's not what we're seeing. We are just not seeing as heavy growth at this point, that it would be difficult to see really big growth. I think you\u2019d be down in the single-digit type - low-single-digit type growth. Having said that, we\u2019re seeing really quite good activity on that what I'll call the light commercial activity of the institutional and the commercial side. And so that piece has been encouraging, but I\u2019d actually - I'd have to go back and do a little research, Andy, to give you a really good answer on that one. Andy Casey : Okay. Thank you, Sandy. And then second, you mentioned within the strength that you saw in non-res construction during the quarter, datacenters activity was pretty good. Did that impact the quarter for you, or is that yet to come-type thing? Sandy Cutler : Yes, I would say that it's a yet to come in terms of actually shipping the stuff. Andy Casey : Okay, great. Thank you very much. Don Bullock : Our last question today will come from Steve Winoker with Bernstein. Steve Winoker : Hi, thanks for fitting me in. Let me do clean up here. Two questions. One operating cash flow, you're talking about growing 15% this year, and we just saw extension the number of, I guess about 6% last year. Where is it coming from? What is the real places especially trying to think about that relative to the margin expansion you have elsewhere? Rick Fearon : We always start, Steve, with - by far our weakest operating cash flow quarter in Q1 and it's buffeted by lots of Q1 type payments related to year-end activities to rebuilding working capital. And so it's always a very modest number in Q1, and I wouldn't look at the year-over-year comparison as a particularly good for cash for the balance of the year. But we do quite a granular buildup to our cash flow for cash and we continue to believe that that range would have given 2.7 to 3.1. It is the most likely range. Sandy Cutler : Steve, I'd add maybe two comments to Rick\u2019s, where we think this year will be very close to one-to-one cash efficiency ratio. And one of the other reasons for that is as you recall last year we talked about when we started in on this process of moving over 20 manufacturing plants, we did put in some safety inventory to assure that our customers were not feeling any interruption of service. We\u2019re pealing that back out this year. So while we\u2019ve built some working capital last year, we'll repealing it back to what we think are more optimal operating levels this year. Rick Fearon : Which will allow us to - if you think about DoH, days on the hand inventory, it will allow us to move that down because it had to be elevated to deal with some of the inventory builds. Steve Winoker : Okay. So it sounds like mostly inventory as opposed to receivables or payables? Sandy Cutler : Yes. I think that's a right way to think about it. Steve Winoker : Okay. And then the second question on corporate expense, the reduction. Can you just give us some clarity where that's coming from? Sandy Cutler : I would say generally - once we saw that we were going to see obviously the hydraulic markets be a little lower, that the vehicle South American be lower, we're simply taking the approach on - and I wouldn\u2019t target it to anyone area, but to an overall, we are going to have to go through another round of really looking hard at expense levels. That's what we did in the first quarter. That's where we got an extra penny in the first quarter from that one, and that's what we would plan to duplicate for the rest of the year, and that obviously gets you roughly your $20 million if we do the same thing we did in the fourth quarter - first quarter, do it three more times, we are right at that number. Steve Winoker : Right. It's a pretty big reduction though. I mean, are these growth initiatives you're going to find - I mean I'm just trying to get a sense for what activities no longer happen this year but maybe get deferred in another year? Sandy Cutler : Yes, more than that, Steve, I would say, it\u2019s much more of the spirit of we have to continue all the time looking at ways to do more with less. And so lot of its process change. It's the great work our teams are doing in terms of productivity improvement. So I wouldn't say, no, it's not cutting growth initiatives. It's about, let's identify what creates value and let's keep working on that issue because we obviously are in a slower growth environment and that\u2019s got to be where you're headed is to create value. Steve Winoker : Okay, great. Thank you. Don Bullock : Thank you very much. And as always, we\u2019ll be available for follow-up calls throughout the day and the remainder of the week and next week. Thank you very much for joining us today. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using the AT&T's Executive Teleconferencing Service. You may now disconnect.",

Welcome to the Eaton Second Quarter Earnings Call. At this time all participant lines are in a listen only mode, and later there'll be an opportunity for questions. As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded, and I'll now turn the floor over to Don Bullock. Donald H. Bullock - Senior Vice President- Investor Relations : Good morning. I'm Don Bullock, Eaton's Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you all for joining us for Eaton's second quarter 2015 earnings call. With me today are Sandy Cutler, Chairman and CEO and Rick Fearon, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer. Our agenda today includes opening remarks by Sandy highlighting the performance in the second quarter along with our outlook for the remainder of 2015. As we've done on our past calls, we'll be taking questions at the end of Sandy's comment. The press release from today's earnings announcement this morning and the presentation we'll go through today have been posted on our website at www.eaton.com. Please note that both the press release and the presentation do include reconciliation to non-GAAP measures. A webcast of this call is accessible on our website and will be available for replay. Before we get started with Sandy's comments, I'd like to remind you that our comments today will include statements related to expected future results of the company and as such, are therefore forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from those in the forecast due to a number of risk factors and uncertainties that we've outlined in our earnings release and in the presentation. They're also covered in the 8-K. With that, I'll turn it over to Sandy for his comments. Alexander M. Cutler - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Great. Thanks, Don, and thank you all for joining us this morning. I'm going to work from the earnings presentation which is posted on our investor page. But before I start through that packet, let me share a couple of overall comments. Our second quarter results we believe were solid and they're really highlighted by the very strong segment margins and terrific enterprise-wide cost control which allowed us to offset the originally higher \u2013 offset the what we had originally anticipated in terms of slightly higher volumes. You'll recall at the end of the first quarter, we had said that, when we looked into the second quarter, our guidance was based upon that volumes would step up about 4% from the first quarter to the second quarter, and in fact, they increased only about 3%. And in that guidance at the end of the first quarter, you may recall we had anticipated that the volumes on our Electrical business would then increase slightly further for the balance of the year beyond the second quarter, while we anticipated revenues in the Hydraulics, Aerospace and Vehicle businesses being pretty flat for the remainder of the year. That would be the second, third and fourth quarters. Well as you saw from our earnings packet, our bookings in the second quarter were disappointing in our Electrical, Hydraulics and Aerospace businesses, and as a result, we believe it reduces the likelihood of more robust revenue growth in the second half. And I'm talking here about revenue again, because there is a time difference between when we book orders and when we ship them. So in this context, we think that we're in an environment where cost control, operational excellence and structural cost reduction are really critical. And that has to be coupled with operational focus on cash generation, and use of the balance sheet, and therefore, really re-deploying how you utilize your cash. And it's in that context that really we're sharing two additional pieces of information beyond our traditional earnings release. The first is this $145 million restructuring program we've announced today, and it is aimed at structural, not variable cost reduction. It involves elimination of positions, closing of a limited number of facilities, consolidation of internal organizations, and frankly, elimination on a permanent basis of some activities within the company. This is not, I would say again, it is not a variable cost reduction exercise. This is a program aimed at reducing structural costs across the company in anticipation of markets not showing substantially stronger growth in the second half, nor next year. The restructuring program is going to provide a very strong payback in 2016, and that'll occur both in terms of segment margins, which you continue to see are focus on increasing segment margins, and in reducing our corporate expenses. All of this on the order of about a $130 million benefit year-to-year between 2015 and 2016. And I'll go through that in a little bit more detail as we go into the individual charts. That with the additional Cooper incremental synergies of $115 million, and that's no change in terms of the incremental numbers, so we feel are appropriate for 2016 versus 2015, will together deliver about a $0.45 benefit in 2016 versus 2015. The second announcement that we're sharing with you today is the next phase in our cash redeployment strategy, and it's clearly more of a recognition of the progress we've made in repaying the acquisition debt we incurred as part of the acquisition of the Cooper industries, and a couple highlights. Now we're targeting an A- long-term credit rating, and that is a change for us. And that really is centered then around allowing us to return 4% to 5% annually to our shareholders through maintaining a commitment to a strong dividend, and then repurchasing shares, and that starts here in the second half of this year, as well as every year going forward. And then as a third priority, undertaking value creating M&A, if we see the right opportunities, and if we see the right pricing to really create value. And with that, let me turn to our traditional earnings packet. And if you'll turn to page three, it's the page that is titled Highlights of Second Quarter Results. I commented on most of these already. Again we think a solid high-quality quarter. Operating earnings per share of $1.16 versus consensus of $1.13, obviously the midpoint of our guidance of $1.15. And as I said before, the real highlights here are margins which were 0.2 of a point higher than what we had guided you to. You may recall we had said that we expected our segment margins to be 15.6%, one point higher than the first quarter. They actually came in at 15.8%, so 120 basis points higher. Really good enterprise cost control, and you see that not only in the margins been better, but you also see it in our corporate expenses being down $0.03. Volume was down some 7%, and obviously within that was an organic revenue decline of 1% excluding the Forex impact of almost 8%. If you turn to the next chart, this chart, four. I think you have had the chance to review our financials already. Really only one number that I would point out beyond what you can read here yourself is obviously our sales did move up 3% from $5.2 billion to $5.372 in this quarter. And the $5.2 was in the first quarter. But if you go back to our first quarter conference call, you recall that our organic growth in the first quarter was 1% positive, now 1% negative and obviously, that's part of the concern that led us to kick off this comprehensive restructuring program. If we move to the next chart, chart five, titled Electrical Products Segment, revenue is down 3% from a year ago, up 6% from the first quarter. So revenue is pretty much in line with what we'd been anticipating for this quarter. Operating margins of 15.8%. Frankly a little disappointing from where we hoped they might be. Really three key issues within that. One, we continue to experience some embedded exchange problems. That takes about $13 million out of the margins this quarter. And frankly, this hasn't been a marketplace where you're able to really announce significant price increases to offset embedded exchange issues. We did get the targeted $11 million of Cooper cost synergies in this segment in the quarter. But then the same issue we talked about in the first quarter is still with us, very strong growth in our lighting business which has a slightly lower incremental. And then weakness, and I'll come back and talk about this more broadly, on the industrial MRO, kind of industrial production demand. I think you're hearing from a number of players in multiple markets that that industrial side of the marketplace continues to be weaker than we'd hoped it might be this year. Bookings continue to be a good story, up 4%; frankly up about 50% more than that in the Americas. So continue to do very well in the Americas. That continues to be the region that is stronger for us. More flattish conditions as you get to Europe and Asia-Pacific. And as I mentioned, the strength in the marketplace is really in the lighting area, it's in residential, and it's in selective parts of the non-residential construction market, and I'll come back and chat a little bit more about that in just a minute. If we move to the second chart, Electrical Systems & Services segment, obviously we think a very good quarter in terms of margin performance, really outstanding margins of 15.1%. Again, baked in there is also about $11 million of Cooper synergies, so overall about $22 million in the quarter between the two of them. If you look at the volumes, you see down 8%. Obviously four points of that, if you look in the green chart in the lower left-hand corner of that, was due to ForEx. And if you remember, this is a segment that as we've talked with you, say look at the bookings in the previous couple of quarters to get a feel for what is likely to happen to shipments in the successive quarter. You may recall that in the first quarter, our bookings were flat; in the fourth quarter 2014 they were flat. And so we're obviously not seeing a lot of strength in the collection of businesses that are within this segment currently. Once again, in the bookings area, you saw a weak quarter. Just not seeing the array of large projects in this business. We see the power systems business being weaker, the three phase power quality market having been weaker. This is the business at Crouse, at Crouse-Hinds, which does have an oil and gas exposure then as well. So in spite of these weaker volumes, we're really very, very pleased, obviously, with the margin performance in this segment. If we turn to page seven, this is titled Hydraulics Segment. I think the story's quite similar to that which we've been sharing with you. Obviously, organic growth of negative 11%, which you see in the lower left-hand corner, green box. It was negative 9% last quarter, so continuing to see weak year-on-year comparisons here. The volume was down just roughly 3% from the first quarter as you see, down 18% from a year ago. Clearly, this is the business where we're suffering the most adverse business conditions in the company, which fortunately are being offset by some very strong results in other segments. We're pleased with the margin performance here, 11.7%. That was up from 10.1% in the first quarter. So all the extensive work that's been going on in this franchise to get at cost levels and get our resources aligned for the kind of volumes that we're dealing with, I think, are being successful. If we look at bookings, bookings were down some 13%, and they're down both on the OEM side as well as the distributor side. And I would say, the only notable area going on within all those different bookings is we did see ag bookings begin to level out. Whereas you recall the last several quarters, we've seen a fairly dramatic reduction from our major agricultural OEMs. We do think that by the time we complete the restructuring program, and I'll come back to talk about that in just a couple charts, that it may well push margins in this segment below 10% in the third quarter. But we would expect them to rebound in the fourth quarter. As you'll hear when I detail the restructuring program, our guidance by segment at the present time for the balance of the year does not include the impact of the restructuring costs. It will reduce overall margins for all five of the segments together by about 0.3 of a point for the full year. And again, I'll come back and clarify that when we get to that chart. If we move to the next chart, chart eight, the Aerospace segment, fairly flattish volumes versus the first quarter, down 2%. Our organic growth was down 2% this particular quarter, but as you'll see in the note that we reflect it both in our earnings release as well is in the yellow colored box on this chart. We did receive some payments in the second quarter last year for nonrecurring engineering programs, so reimbursements from customers. If you take that out, you really get an organic growth that is fairly similar to what we're seeing across the industry of about 3% currently. We're very pleased with the terrific margins achieved in this business here. Again, a reflection, we think, of great operational management, really effective program management, and the fact that the aftermarket bookings, which had trended up over the last several quarters, began to materialize in shipments, giving us obviously a little bit more favorable mix there. On the bookings side, down roughly 9%. Maybe three elements to keep in mind there. The commercial side is continuing much as we've seen, up roughly 4%. Military was down just over 30% in this particular quarter. Part of that's timing. And then the aftermarket was not as strong a quarter this quarter, down 5% overall. So sort of a mixed picture on the aerospace bookings side. And then on the Vehicle segment, that's chart nine, really a terrific quarter in our Vehicle business. Volumes up 4% from the first quarter, down 4% from last year. But if you look in the green box in the lower left-hand corner, you'll see continued strong organic growth of 4% this quarter. It was also 4% last quarter. So very strong production \u2013 or results. And those 19.2% margins clearly have to be regarded as outstanding margins. We had a lot of things go right for us, but frankly, our team made a lot of things go right in this quarter, so, really proud of their achievements. From a market point of view, Class 8 number, but we continue to think the build will be around 330,000 units here in North America this year. It is \u2013 the highest quarter of the year, we think, did occur in the second quarter. And our view of the remainder of the year is that while we were at about 89,000 units for industry production in the second quarter, it's likely to be on the order of 82,000 and then 80,000 as we go through the balance of this year. And then on the South American vehicle market, I think you hear from us, and you're hearing from many others, we just don't see any recovery occurring in that marketplace during this year. So if we turn now to some broader indices around the company, let's go to chart 10. We did reduce our organic revenue growth this year. And as you recall, we, in April, had shared with you our view that it would be up 2% to 3%. We now think 0% to 1%. Frankly the biggest change took place here in the hydraulics market where we now think the organic growth was in the order of a negative 6% to negative 8% where we thought it might be negative 2% to negative 4%. Anticipating a question, when does this stop the fall? We've obviously got to start to see bookings start to stabilize, and at this point, we have not seen that occur yet. We believe this is our best estimate of where this market will end this year, but clearly if you're watching many of our OEMs' customers' results, you're seeing they're continuing to talk about very weak economic conditions. This overall mixed global economic environment that is laid out by our ability only to grow 0% to 1%, again is the reason we decided we needed to take further structural cost out of the company. And we think that puts us in a very good position then to be able to produce year-to-year earnings gains in 2016 over 2015. If we move to chart 11, the next chart, it's labeled Segment Margin Expectations. Again, if you look down this overall chart, this set of guidance for the individual segments is being provided, excluding the impact of this 2015 restructuring program we just announced. Until we have the opportunity, and we'll be doing this over the next couple weeks, to fully share in our internal communications each of the actions we're undertaking, we're not prepared to share how much of the cost or how much of the benefit will drop into each of the segments. We'll obviously do so in our next earnings result, just as we have in the past after we've completed making those types of announcements. If you look on this chart, the three segments that have changed, the electrical products margin change, really two issues driving that. This issue of embedded exchange which has been stubborn for us with the Canadian piece being one of the big pieces of that, and then the mix that I talked about of less industrial market activity, and then higher lighting activity. In the Electrical Systems & Services, it's just the slow bookings basically. And in Vehicle, the move up is just really great execution out of our team in that particular area. If we move to the next chart, chart 12, maybe a couple of the highlights for the restructuring program which we've announced today. Once again, structural, not variable cost reduction. To complete this chart and anticipate a question, we spent about $15 million in the first half of this year in terms of our restructuring cost. So the total for 2015 will be this $120 million you see on the top line of this chart in the third column, plus the $15 million we spent in the first half, so a total of $135 million. This particular program which we're announcing here has about $145 million as you can see. It's spread across the third and fourth quarter this year and then about $25 million will extend into next year. Of the savings versus the $120 million of cost this year will be about $45 million. A lot of these actions we're taking have fairly immediate payback, for a net negative this year of about $75 million. So when you think about our guidance reduction that was in our earnings release today of roughly 6%, roughly 3 points of those 6 points comes from this proactive program to address structural costs and give us a running start on 2016. Then, if you were to look at the year-to-year numbers just to help you understand those for a moment. It's our belief that we will always have restructuring in any given year. In these types of slower times, slower growth times, we think an appropriate planning number in that regard is $50 million to $60 million of restructuring, so we're not suggesting that restructuring would go away next year. In fact we think it has to be a part of the portrait every year in these kind of conditions. So the way to think about the year-to-year benefit is there's an $80 million incremental savings in 2016 on top of the $45 million of savings this year. So that's the first $80 million plus for next year. And then we would have spent $135 million on restructuring this year. That was the total of the $120 million in the second half and the $15 million in the first half. We will spend $25 million on this program next year, so $135 million minus $25 million, then minus \u2013 if I took the high end of our range of the $50 million to $60 million range, that would be a difference of $50 million of less restructuring next year spent. So you get to $130 million by adding the $80 million incremental savings and the $50 million less restructuring expense, that's an incremental $130 million. If we move to the next chart, chart 13, operating EPS guidance, I think we've covered a number of these items but as we think about our third quarter, our guidance for operating earnings per share is $1.10 to \u2013 excuse me, $1.00 to $1.10, midpoint $1.05. We anticipate organic revenue will move up about 2% to 3% from the second-quarter. That's fairly typical for us and it looks reasonable to us at this point. Tax rate between 9% and 10%. The guidance does incorporate the restructuring charge and the savings, so this net impact, as you see here. And as we think about margins in the third quarter, net of this restructuring expense, we think margins would be around 15% in total. And then as we get to the fourth quarter, we think they'll be just over 16% and our best estimate on volumes at this point is the fourth quarter volumes will probably look a lot like the third quarter, so no real substantial change. But once again then, when you look at the full year, the $4.40 to $4.60 which is a reduction of $0.30 from our previous guidance, $0.15 of that $0.30 change has to do with the restructuring programs which we just discussed. If we move to chart 14, labeled 2015 Outlook Summary, just, we've tried to provide you here with kind of a summary of our guidance as we go through this year. I would call to your attention in the right-hand box labeled July, that is in the gray color, just a couple numbers that we haven't talked about yet. Obviously, you saw that we had lowered our corporate expense in the first quarter; we lowered it further in the second quarter. And if we look at the full year this year, we now expect our pension, interest and general corporate expenses to be $10 million to $30 million below 2014 levels. It really reflects, I think, a great symmetry with what's going on in every one of our businesses as we're working really hard on cost control in this kind of environment. I would also \u2013 if you look to this chart on the very last number in the lower right-hand corner, you'll see that we've reduced our CapEx spending this year by $100 million. That allows us to, with this lower activity level, only have our free cash flow decline by about $200 million this year. Now let me turn to the second subject that I briefly previewed which is our capital allocation strategy. If you turn to chart 15, it's the chart labeled Our Capital Allocation Strategy Has Changed Over Time. What we tried to lay out here was three different time periods in terms of what we were doing with our capital. Obviously in this period of 2000 to 2012, we were undertaking a fairly fundamental portfolio transformation of the company. We divested some businesses, we acquired some 66 businesses. And as you can see the preponderance of our capital was flowing into the new businesses as we built a different portfolio for the company. Obviously we acquired Cooper at the end of 2012. We took on $4.9 billion of acquisition debt. We made a commitment to repay $2.1 billion of that and I think we would characterize this period of 2013 to 2015 as one of repaying debt while still expanding our dividend at very attractive levels but clearly we curtailed and virtually withdrew from the M&A markets in that time period. Now having repaid roughly $400 million of debt in the first half this year, with the prospect of we have a payment of $600 million in the second half of this year, so repaying $1 billion of debt this year, we're now really ready to be looking at what do we do in these next several years in terms of capital. And I think what you see here in the chart, and I'll detail it more a little bit on the second page, is a more balanced approach to what we would be doing with capital going forward. And so you can see there's a continued commitment obviously to maintaining (24:10-24:11) to grow the company to continue to have a very strong return of value to shareholders obviously through both repurchase and a strong dividend program but we do reenter, or anticipate reentering the acquisition market. So if we go to the next chart, chart 16 which is labeled Summary of Future Capital Allocation Plans. A couple key points; we're comfortable maintaining our A- long-term debt rating instead of pushing in the short term to get back to an A. That allows us some flexibility in really starting to utilize capital for other purposes on a little bit of an accelerated basis. And really the key element I think off this entire chart is, we intend to use dividends and share repurchase to return between 4% to 5% of our market cap to shareholders on an annual basis. Historically, we have been a more opportunistic purchaser of shares. We still plan on doing that opportunistically so we're not scheduling it by individual month or by individual quarter, but we are making the commitment that we will be returning to shareholders 4% to 5% of our market cap on an annual basis. And we think that's an important part of our shareholder value strategy going forward, particularly in these periods of times. Then for the balance of the capital, we'd intend to pursue M&A to continue to advance our business strategies. And as you kind of tie all of this into where we are here at the middle of 2015, we do plan on repurchases in the second half of 2015. And we'll feather that along with the $600 million debt repayment we have in November. And then I think it's reasonable to believe that share repurchases would then accelerate further into 2016 as more capital becomes available. So while some of that may feel a little anticlimactic versus what a couple of you had speculated on in various different pieces of research, I think the big headline here is annual return to shareholders of 4% to 5% through dividend and through repurchase. If we then turn to chart 17, I think we've touched on most of these. That obviously organic growth has been slower; it's been disappointing for us this year. We think the appropriate response to that is take cost out, restructure in terms of corporation, continue the focus on cost containment and margin improvement. That is why we've implemented this restructuring program. After we pay down this debt, we really are in a position to again, to be able to actuate this capital allocation program that I mentioned to you. And then again, our lower midpoint in terms of $0.30 operating earnings per share lower midpoint, 50% of that or $0.15 of the $0.30 change really comes from the restructuring plan which we think lays an attractive foundation for 2016. If then if we move simply to chart 18, the initial thoughts, it's labelled Initial Thoughts on 2016. We do feel that this program is one that will create real value for us. We think this $50 million to $60 million restructuring level is a level that's appropriate for a company of our size during relatively slow incremental growth. The Cooper integration incremental savings, those decisions are largely completed now, and the biggest portion of what we'll finance, the additional cost savings portion of this next year will be the finishing up of the plant programs and they're very much on schedule at this point. Then I spoke to the cash deployment and strategy. So hopefully that gives you a feel within the specifics within the overall comments I shared with you up front. Again, we think cost control, operational excellence, cash generation and then cash deployment, particularly on the share buyback as well as a strong dividend are the real priorities for us at this time. Don, with that, I'll turn things back to you. Donald H. Bullock - Senior Vice President- Investor Relations : All right. Operator will give the instructions for the question and answers. Operator : Thank you. Donald H. Bullock - Senior Vice President- Investor Relations : Our first question comes from Steve Winoker with Bernstein. Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thanks. Good morning, guys. Alexander M. Cutler - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Morning, Steve. Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hey. Just a couple of questions. First, in terms of the acceleration that you're expecting, the 2% to 3% in Q3 relative to the down 1% in 2, and tough in Q1 and then the bookings deceleration. So where should investors count on that acceleration to take place? Alexander M. Cutler - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Again, I would say 2% to 3% is not a big number to start with. Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: It's all relative. Alexander M. Cutler - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : That's third quarter versus second quarter. Richard H. Fearon - Vice Chairman, Chief Financial & Planning Officer : It's from Q2 to Q3, sorry. Don't confuse that, Steve, with year-over-year. Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Right. Okay. Okay, but where is the acceleration that you're \u2013 the 2% to 3% is just a sequential increase? Richard H. Fearon - Vice Chairman, Chief Financial & Planning Officer : Yeah. That's correct. Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: What's your year-on-year? Alexander M. Cutler - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Boy, I'd have to go look because you've got ForEx differences and all and that's why we focused on the \u2013 we gave our guidance for the second quarter based off the first quarter as well, and that's the same way we're providing this because the ForEx gets to be pretty confusing when you start to look at that year-to-year. Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay, so, but basically you're just telling us that it's normal seasonality. Alexander M. Cutler - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Correct. Richard H. Fearon - Vice Chairman, Chief Financial & Planning Officer : Yes. Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. And no acceleration? Alexander M. Cutler - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : No. I think, Steve, I think there is an element I think where there is some conflicting data out there generally, and others may have the same question and that would be in the U.S. nonresidential market. Because you did see, I think everyone saw the ABI index came out at 55 last month. Many people regard that as a predictor of the commercial side of nonresidential and that you may see the commercial side start to strengthen through here. You know that we use an index for nonresidential that also includes oil and gas and mining. Some do not do that. And so we do think you're going to see the nonresidential market for this year that doesn't include oil and mining probably go up between 4% and 5%. By the time you put in an anticipated 25% reduction in the oil and gas markets, those numbers become closer to 1%. So you may hear some very different numbers quoted by different people. It has a lot to do with what they include in their index. We do think the small project side has strengthened a little bit. But we don't see that this is an 8% to 9% nonresidential year not including oil and gas. Our view is that you do see ABI bounce around a little bit month-to-month. We too are encouraged but we really would like to see those orders getting placed and that wasn't our experience in the second quarter. Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Right. And when you talk about initial thoughts on 2016 and expecting continued slow market growth, you're talking about growth that's consistent with where you're exiting 2015. Is that correct? Alexander M. Cutler - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Well, we haven't put a specific number on it next year but it just, it feels like we're still in this global GDP condition that is similar to the full year this year. And as we look forward at this point, without putting a specific forecast on it, if you continue to see the U.S. grow kind of at rates like they are now and Europe more or less like it is, it's hard to point to other major economies that are going to accelerate. There are questions, obviously, in China. Everyone's got their own view of that. India is perhaps the one area that is accelerating but it doesn't have that big an effect on global GDP. And so it feels to us more like we're in a period of rather prolonged slower growth. And that's why we felt the right proactive action here is get structural cost out so that we can continue to grow EPS even if markets stay relatively slow. Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: And that's at that normal 25% or 26% incremental margins that you would usually use or... Alexander M. Cutler - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. We used 20% in our guidance this year. We haven't put a number on it next year, but I do think what you heard from us, obviously, is we think there's two big propellants of earning growth next year, the $130 million year-to-year that comes out of the additional savings for our restructuring plan and then lower restructuring plus Cooper. So we've got two big pluses going into next year. Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Right. But excluding those, it's in that same 20% range. Alexander M. Cutler - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. I think at this point it's a good number. We'll be able to tune it when we get into this fall. Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. And just lastly on the buyback, the 1% to 2% programmatic buyback, why not think about that in terms of a larger number, at least given where the stock has been earlier in that period, (33:17), or how are you thinking about that, Sandy? Alexander M. Cutler - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : And I think the way \u2013 and thanks for the question because it's one I think that's important to everyone who's a shareholder, is that at these kind of price levels, clearly our preference, or first priority is the share buyback. And so we always tune these things to kind of the value of our stock vis-\u00e0-vis what we can create in terms of value of the \u2013 with an acquisition. And that's why when I stated my kind of summary at the beginning, I said our priority is a commitment to maintaining a strong dividend. It's repurchasing shares both in the second half of this year and each year going forward and then, as a third priority, undertaking value-creating M&A. Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay, great. That's helpful. I'll pass it on. Thanks. Donald H. Bullock - Senior Vice President- Investor Relations : Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yeah. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Alexander M. Cutler - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Morning. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: So Sandy or Rick, I think the product margins obviously, Sandy, you mentioned that they were disappointing and you talked about the impact of the exchange problems and the inability to price against that. I'm wondering what actually improves in the second half of the year to get us from a 15% handle into an 18% handle for the back half of the year. Alexander M. Cutler - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, I would say a couple things. One, a slight volume increase because these are products that have attractive margins on them. Our embedded is getting less as we're going \u2013 change is getting less as we're going through the year. And then third is, normally our peaks occur in the third quarter. And so that we would expect to have that kind of strong seasonal lift that has to do with some of the mix that occurs within the business. I'd say those are the three main items, because we'll continue to get synergy savings, but that's in both segments and in products. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: So it's richer mix combined with a waning FX headwind. Okay. Yep, yep. That's pretty clear. And then on Hydraulics, obviously you've taken another bite out of that one, but I'm wondering, is the down 6% to 8% enough given the order numbers? And if I run the numbers through my model, it implies that sales seem to stabilize at 2Q levels. And I'm wondering, normally we see sales down sequentially in 3Q and 4Q. So I'm wondering, is that appropriate given the fact that you mentioned that orders haven't stabilized yet? Alexander M. Cutler - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Nigel, I think it's a very reasonable question. This has been a challenging one for us to get as well. So I'm not going to stand on a pulpit and tell you we know this one to a decimal point. Clearly we're spending a lot of time with our customers really trying to understand their order patterns and their degree of visibility. We were slightly encouraged that the ag piece, at least for a quarter, appeared to bottom. I'd like to see that for a few more quarters. We're not seeing that turnaround yet in global construction. And clearly the oil and gas side still is pretty tough in this area, because we're more exposed to fracking type of oil and gas here than we are in electrical. And clearly it's been pretty flattened, if you will. So our assumption is that we're going to be able to operate it at relatively similar volumes here for the balance of the year, but it's one that I wish we had a little bit better visibility to as well. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: That's fair enough. And then one final one, if I can. You've given us some good framework for 2016 in some of the non-operating items. One more might be pension and I'm kind of just talking about pension tailwind in 2016. And I'm wondering, do you have the data point if you snap the line today on pension? What would that tailwind be for 2016? Richard H. Fearon - Vice Chairman, Chief Financial & Planning Officer : Well, Nigel, I'll jump in. It's a little bit hard this early in the year to make an estimate, because it does very much depend upon the discount rate. And the discount rate is, depending on Fed action over the next several months, may well change. I will tell you just to give you a couple of data points, we did end the second quarter at 88% funded in our U.S. plan, so pretty nice level of funding. And that is a help, of course, as you look at expense for next year. So modestly optimistic signs about lower expense next year, but it's really too early to make a precise forecast. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Fair enough. Thanks a lot. Donald H. Bullock - Senior Vice President- Investor Relations : Our next question comes from Ann Duignan with JPMorgan. Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning. First, maybe, Sandy, you could give us some color on your outlook for the remainder of the year, maybe into next year but break out Electrical Products versus Electrical Systems & Services. Alexander M. Cutler - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, see I think that when you get within, let me just start on Electrical Systems & Services, because there are a number of different businesses within that. And if we think about our view of markets as to what's going on, we continue to see on the utility side that that's a pretty flattish market at this point. I think you're hearing fairly similar numbers from, and I'm not talking about the transmission side. I'm talking about primarily the distribution side here. And I think you're hearing those from others. On the harsh and hazardous sides of the market, and not all of our Crouse-Hinds business is harsh and hazardous, but that portion which is really in and around oil and gas, we continue to think oil and gas is like a negative 25 marketplace. That's very much where we started off the year. Industrial, we think really two very different things going on with industrial. There are some very, very large industrial projects going on. Those tend to be around liquid gas. Some of these projects are some of the biggest projects that have been seen in the U.S. in many, many years. But all the electrical for them has not yet been awarded. So you're seeing some of these projects show up in big construction put in place numbers, but the actual awards haven't been made yet. And so we think the numbers are getting pushed around. So I'd say on the very, very big projects, there are a couple of really big ones. But then if you get to the industrial MRO and the machine builder, that's where we describe the industrial malaise is still very much in place and seeing markets, individual segments kind of 0% to 1% in those areas. So that's one of the areas that has caused us some mix issues this year. Resi continues to be quite attractive, kind of 6% to 8%. We see that continuing. There've been some individual months of up and down. On non-resi, we would agree with others who say the commercial side of non-resi is kind of growing in those mid-single digit numbers, but the oil and gas and mining side which does affect construction, obviously as well, we think is at negative 25. So that's kind of our view with what's been going on in the nonresidential markets and also why you're starting to see some different numbers being quoted in terms of the industrial markets. It really depends whether people are in MRO or are they in machine building or are they in major industrial construction. And I'd say the data center markets, the data center markets overall are probably growing in terms of electrical content several percent, say 2% to 3%. I'm talking about the big data centers. But it's different depending upon whether you're selling UPS or whether you're selling power distribution equipment. The UPS is probably slightly negative and then the power distribution, because the size of these centers is getting bigger and the power consumption's getting bigger, is probably on the order of a plus 5%. So that hopefully gives you kind of a quick feel for, within the electrical businesses kind of how we're seeing those individual markets. Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Wow, yeah. Good color, Sandy, because I was just curious about the very large manufacturing infrastructure build that's going on and whether you'd seen any orders in that sector yet. But are those orders on the up-and-coming, you think, into 2016? They just lag the actual construction? Is that the way we should think about it? Alexander M. Cutler - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Well I think two things, and thanks for the follow-up, because it's very much on point, is that some of those have been awarded. The largest portion of them have not yet been awarded, but then the second issue is that even if they're awarded in the third quarter, those very big projects may be nine months to a year or a little longer before they get shipped. So those big projects will not have an impact upon 2015 shipments. There'll be much more of an issue of middle of or second half of 2016. Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. And just a quick follow-up then on the restructuring. Could you at least \u2013 I know you're not willing to give us guidance by segment, and I appreciate that. Could you give us some feel for what percent of the cost in savings will be in the segment line items and what percent you think might be in the corporate line item? Could you break it down that way for us? Alexander M. Cutler - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Well, the segments themselves will \u2013 it's about three-tenths of 1% is how that net of cost and benefits this year will reduce segment profits this year. I think on the corporate side, it'll be largely self-liquidating this year, that the benefits will offset the costs. And so I think that's about where to think about it for this year. Richard H. Fearon - Vice Chairman, Chief Financial & Planning Officer : Well, essentially, Ann, all of the net cost will end up in the segments given that the corporate is basically neutral after the savings. Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. I appreciate the color. Thank you. I'll get back in queue. Alexander M. Cutler - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Yup. Donald H. Bullock - Senior Vice President- Investor Relations : Our next question comes from Eli Lustgarten with Longbow. Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC : Good morning, everyone. Alexander M. Cutler - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Morning, Eli. Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC : Let me get some clarification. Sandy, during your presentation you gave us $130 million savings and restructuring $115 from Cooper. That was a net $0.45 for 2016. That excludes the ongoing $50 million to $60 million restructuring costs, is that how you're looking at that? Alexander M. Cutler - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Yes. It does exclude it because in that calculation, I netted the restructuring of next year plus the $25 million against the restructuring this year. So that is a net-net number. Correct. Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC : Yeah. And the reason you have restructuring that impacts the segment which is typically \u2013 we've always been Xing them out in some form \u2013 this is plant disruptions and plant closings and stuff that really affects operations that you can't exclude and that because it affects the business. Is that the reason why we have to include it in that business? Alexander M. Cutler - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Well, our restructuring costs we've always included right in the segments. We don't break them out in our financials. It's only the acquisition integration charges that we break out separately. So this runs right through our operating costs. Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC : Okay. Okay. And one other clarification. The $48 million in corporate costs is down, like, $15 million or something like that. Is that the new run rate for the rest of the year or does it go back up to $60 million plus, or... Richard H. Fearon - Vice Chairman, Chief Financial & Planning Officer : If you look at the guidance we've given, Eli, we think it'll go up a little bit and that's consistent with the \u2013 we gave you guidance on corporate pension interest and general corp going down $10 million to $30 million. But it will still be a run rate that is better than \u2013 it's certainly better than last year, and frankly, a little bit better than the first quarter. Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC : Okay. Going back to the question that Ann had on electrical businesses, you gave us the breakdown. Is it basically the Electrical Products organic growth at probably 2% or 3% positive, and Electrical Systems & Services is like -3% organic growth or so? Is that the best way to look at those two businesses as you look out for the year? Alexander M. Cutler - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Boy, we'd have to break that for you once more, because we try to really provide that guidance together because they're a little difficult, the markets going forward to bust them apart, but the products will be higher obviously than the segment, and we would think that the markets in electrical S&S will be negative, slightly negative this year, whereas Electrical Products will be slightly positive. I think that's not a bad way to think about it, Eli. Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC : And then my final question, in hydraulics you kept the margin forecast the same, but with the lower volume and the uncertainties have you, is that actions you've already taken that give you confidence that the margins will stay \u2013 will actually improve in the second half of the year to get you into that range, or... Alexander M. Cutler - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, we were pleased with our margins in the second quarter and I think it reflects the traction of the team really working very hard on that, and with the additional actions we'll be taking, that's what gives us our best shot is we think this is about where they'll settle for the year. Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC : All right. Thank you very much. Alexander M. Cutler - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Yep. Thanks, Eli. Donald H. Bullock - Senior Vice President- Investor Relations : Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse. Julian C. H. Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thanks. I'll keep the questions brief. Firstly just on, you talked about the need for a corporation to react to an ongoing low growth environment and the restructuring is obviously part of that. I just wondered how you could talk about the portfolio in that same light around dealing with low growth. I think you talked about cutting some activities at the very beginning. Also obviously, the balance sheet is now available to use for M&A. So maybe talk about the portfolio in the context of low growth. Alexander M. Cutler - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, I'd say that I think our thinking there is A, number one, it's about the cost control, operational excellence, and cash generation. So I think those are the three upfront pieces. I think we were fairly clear this morning that we see in terms of the discretionary use of cash, the first calls are the dividend and share re-buyback. And so in that context, I would then say, what are we then going to do in terms of continuing review of portfolio. And that is an ongoing activity we have within the company. Some of the things that we will discontinue in the company in terms of individual activities will be areas where we feel we're not creating value. So no portfolio transformation announcements to make, but I'd say we're working on that tuning as part of this as well. Julian C. H. Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thanks. And then just circling back to Electrical Products, EBIT, if we just \u2013 I realize quarters, different things move around. But if we just look at the first half overall for the Electrical Products group, sales were down about $80 million, EBIT's down about $40 million. And I think that FX translation and transaction as well as Cooper synergies net off against each other, they're $20 million, $25 million each for the half. So maybe just try and explain exactly what is going on in Electrical Products. Is it something about pricing? I realize there's a slight mix hit from lighting, but that shouldn't be big enough to cause a 50% incremental margin. Alexander M. Cutler - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : It's two issues on the mix. You correctly note the lighting, but equally, or more powerful is the fact that the industrial MRO activity is very weak and those products carry significantly higher margins than the average, nor lighting, which lighting being below the average. Those are the big ones that really hit it. Julian C. H. Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Thank you. Donald H. Bullock - Senior Vice President- Investor Relations : Our next question comes from Robert McCarthy with Stifel. Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Good morning everyone. Alexander M. Cutler - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Morning. Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah I guess, Sandy, kind of dovetailing off some of the others' comments, and you might not be able to answer this question, but clearly you're battening the hatches in terms of the incremental restructuring, the cut, the 20% cut to CapEx. When did you kind of arrive at this? And did it change your overall conveyance of what capital your capital allocation plan was? Obviously not in terms of details because you can't share that, but just in terms of substance and philosophy, do you think it changed over the past 45 days? Alexander M. Cutler - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : I think a number of people, as we've listened to other calls too, have asked the question about momentum during the quarter and I think this sort of gets to that subject as well. And I'd say the big momentum change in the quarter was that I think some parties came out of the first quarter encouraged with the relative strength in March versus the strength in January and February. We cautioned not to get overly enthused about March because in many ways we thought March was a recovery for a very poor January and February. We saw April come out feeling very much in line with what our caution had been, that it didn't continue the very strong surge that we had seen in the month of March and May was a fairly weak month in terms of bookings. And we've seen that across the industries we participate in. I think with that view that the economy did not feel like it was accelerating, there's a fair amount of choppy economic data that's been coming in from around the world. That's what really \u2013 and then obviously watching our own bookings, led us to believe that we're not going to see a year in 2015 of significantly strengthening economic activity in the second half. And so that really, I think was our clue that it was time to think about the alternative plan for the year and that's very much what we had in hand in terms of a restructuring program. Having said that, that doesn't mean that we don't think there's potential, obviously, in these markets over time, but we do think that you can't go through a period where the economy is sort of stalling a bit, and I'm talking globally here, without taking cost out. And that's why we're committed to take prompt action to take cost out because we think it both protects margin, it guards against any further downside and it sets up, we think, a very attractive 2016. Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Related to that point, I think in the past in terms of your public pronouncements and meetings with investors, you talked about just the strong core cash generation you particularly expect, particularly going into 2016. And I don't want to throw numbers out there but clearly, a pretty sizable number that can be used for ample capital redeployment. How does that view change given what you've seen now? And then two other related questions to that, really quickly, is just how do you think about M&A given the bid-ask in this environment versus your own stock price, and then how about succession just given the fact that we could be in a very volatile environment for the next 12 to 18 months? Alexander M. Cutler - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : We don't necessarily see great volatility because I think that is not what has typified the last couple years. In this lower growth environment, you tend to have less volatility. And so I would say I think our view is more that we're in a period of prolonged slow growth that does put pressure on cost. That's why we're taking the actions that we're in. We did obviously cut back our CapEx by $100 million because we wanted to ensure that our cash flow would decline only by about $200 million, and that's not enough to really move our plans one way or another. So we think we're well within that band of flexibility to put our plans in place. But once again, we think the prudent position in these kind of marketplaces is to be sure you've got a team that really can execute on cost, that can really execute on deliveries and getting all the key product introductions done on time, and that you can really deploy cash into ensuring that you've got strong returns for your shareholders. And in these kinds of markets, we think a 4% to 5% annual return to shareholders is very powerful and that's why we've put this plan in place. Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: And then just succession, and just talk about your own stock price versus prevailing M&A deals because the problem is, you're dealing with an environment where the multiples have started to be fairly robust in what could be a pronounced cyclical rollover here. Alexander M. Cutler - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, and I think our record has been one of being careful on pricing. And again, I tried to be pretty clear in my introductory comments that as we think about these three uses of cash, after we do R&D and after we do capital expenditures to grow and maintain the business and assure we have safe workplaces, we remain committed to a strong dividend. Second, repurchasing shares, and that starts, as I said, in the second half of this year. And then the third priority is the M&A, and that is very much the way we think about it and I think it's pronounced when you see our share price in the low $60s. It's pretty clear which one's our priority in that regard. Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thanks for your time. Donald H. Bullock - Senior Vice President- Investor Relations : The next question comes from Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc. Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Hey. Good morning, guys. Alexander M. Cutler - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Morning, Jeff. Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Sandy, I just want to drill down on the distributor orders and hydraulics and all the commentary about industrial MRO, and can you just speak to maybe the level of destocking you're hearing about, how long you're hearing that lasts, and maybe just more broadly, why all that \u2013 why we're seeing such weakness there? Alexander M. Cutler - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, I think whether we talk in the Electrical business or we talk in the industrial business, and I'll speak to the \u2013 or the Hydraulics business. I don't think it's as much a huge destock as that people just have not really rebuilt deep inventories and they're not going to at this point. I think they see it, as well, as a slow growth marketplace. I think the piece that has probably surprised people more than anything else, and you really started to hear about it the end of the first quarter, is this lack of industrial MRO spending. And we hear it from partner after partner after partner, from \u2013 whether it be in Hydraulics or whether it be in Electrical, I'd say that's the piece of the market. And people have different theories as to why, whether this is related to machine builders not exporting as much because of the currency differential, whether it's just concern at this point, whether it's the fact the economy's not growing hard enough, really, to be pushing equipment for renewal and utilization. But that's the side of the business that is much slower than we would've anticipated it would be. Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. Helpful. Thanks. Donald H. Bullock - Senior Vice President- Investor Relations : Our next question comes from John Inch with Deutsche Bank. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good morning, everyone. Alexander M. Cutler - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : How you doing John? John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Morning. So we did \u2013 I guess we had originally planned to do $40 million of restructuring in Hydraulics and we did $15 million. And so I'm just trying to understand here. The incremental restructuring, did you guys \u2013 was the idea that Hydraulics restructuring was not structural so have you replaced that program with the new restructuring numbers? I don't know if I'm being clear, but the $120 million is obviously inclusive of the extra $25 million we were including. Is that not correct? And then is there a mix sort of in terms of how you're restructuring within the Hydraulics segment? Alexander M. Cutler - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Let me address Hydraulics first, is that no significant change in what we were and are doing in Hydraulics. And we've been working obviously on trying to get the business properly sized for what we think has been a weaker market conditions that weren't going to go away. So I'd say no change there, John, in terms of what we're trying to get done. And the reason we broke the $15 million out for everyone's benefit today is that we wanted you to be able to get a feel for what the full year restructuring in the company was for 2015 so you'd be able to compare it to the prospective run rate in 2016. But no, I'd say the Hydraulics what we plan to do in Hydraulics is within that $120 million. We've never said exactly what it was going to be but we tried to provide some ranges for people. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: And so, Sandy, is the extra $80 million, is that proportionately spread? I apologize if you said this before. Or did you sort of take Hydraulics as a template and spread it into the other businesses then? Alexander M. Cutler - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : No. Each business has got its own priorities and areas where we thought we needed to address structural cost, and that's true at the corporate level. So I'd say what is common and what we're trying to do in all the businesses and the corporate areas is really get at structural costs, because we're not as interested in a variable cost reduction. We're really looking to take a layer of cost out that doesn't creep back into the business as volumes come back. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yep. And then just to go back to the organic growth comments for the year, so we were pretty flat in the first half. You're thinking the year is now flat to up a little bit, but do you think the third quarter \u2013 I realize your comment's sequential versus year-over-year, but you have said the third quarter's up 2% to 3%. So does that imply the fourth quarter is flat to possibly down? And I realize there's a very slightly tougher compare, or is there anything beyond seasonality to read into the fourth quarter trend? Alexander M. Cutler - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : No, and we think that the fourth quarter's likely to look a lot like the third quarter on a sequential basis, not a year-to-year basis, so that you step up this kind of 2% to 3% in the third and then generally the fourth quarter is close or just a little bit less than the third quarter. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Just lastly then, the capital allocation for M&A, Sandy. All of this is sort of a free cash flow capital allocation. What are your thoughts toward possibly raising that debt if opportunistically some acquisition opportunities were to come along? We're starting to see that a little bit with a couple of your peers, so would you rule that out until you're paying off this Cooper debt or possibly would you think about possibly raising some debt to do a larger deal in the second half? Alexander M. Cutler - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, we've got a $600 million debt payment in November of this year and we're committed to make that payment. Frankly, if we were going to be working on some deal, the likelihood that it would close in the near-term is fairly low. So I think it really gets to be more of an issue of in early 2016 would we prospectively look at some other financing alternatives. And I'd say honestly, that would depend upon the quality of the opportunity. We obviously have got the ability to do that but, again, our top priorities here, again, are maintaining a strong dividend and having this 4% to 5% annual return to shareholders and then once we can do all of that, it's looking at the M&A alternatives. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got it. Okay. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it. Donald H. Bullock - Senior Vice President- Investor Relations : I recognize this morning we have a number of earnings releases. So we're going to have time on the call for one more question and at that point in time we'll be available afterward to answer any follow-up questions. Our next question is from Shannon O'Callaghan with UBS. Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC : Morning, guys. Alexander M. Cutler - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Morning. Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC : Hey. One just quick follow-up kind of on Julian's question a little bit. I mean we're going to have, I guess, Electrical profit down this year even with the $115 million of Cooper synergies and I understand the points around FX and mix. I'm just wondering if \u2013 I just want to make sure we're actually getting the FX hit right. I mean, do you have what that impact is to this year? That's one part of it. And then also in terms of this mix dynamic, I mean, do you see anything changing that? It seems like lighting probably is going to continue outgrow industrial MRO for a while. So just maybe some thoughts on anything that could change that mix. Richard H. Fearon - Vice Chairman, Chief Financial & Planning Officer : As I think Sandy commented, Shannon, other than the normal sequential uptick the mix is not likely to change dramatically and we don't have a detailed forecast on FX by segment for the whole year. I mean it's pretty darn hard to forecast it for the quarter coming up just given all of the volatility. But I would expect that you're going to see, as we've said, overall a decline of about 5% due to FX so you can roughly back into that based upon the first half. Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC : Yeah. I just didn't know if you were getting an extra high level of margin hit or something like that, but that's fine. In terms of Vehicle going from sort of 4% first half, flat second half, maybe just a little more commentary on the dynamics there. Thanks. Alexander M. Cutler - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Well the big \u2013 as we mentioned at the end of last quarter is there are some years in which the North American heavy-duty truck market is either accelerating or decelerating quarter-to-quarter. We had thought this year would be relatively flat. It looks like a little bit more volume got pulled into the second quarter and so the third and fourth quarter will actually be lower activity levels there than it was in the second quarter. On the North American light vehicle marketplace, fairly flattish as you look through this year, obviously at very attractive levels. And then I guess the market many people have been keeping their eye on right now is the Chinese market in terms of having seen the month-to-month volume crack here in the last month in terms of light vehicle so when we put it all together and of course we've talked about South America probably enough that we see the volumes being relatively flattish as we go through the back half of this year. Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Great. Thanks. Donald H. Bullock - Senior Vice President- Investor Relations : I want to thank you all for joining us on the call this morning. As always, we will be available to take follow-up questions after the call. Thank you very much. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the presentation here for today. We do thank you for participating and you may now disconnect.",

Welcome to the Eaton Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode, later we\u2019ll conduct the question-and-answer session; instructions will be provided at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today\u2019s conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Don Bullock, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Don Bullock : Good morning. I\u2019m Don Bullock, Eaton\u2019s Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you for joining us for Eaton\u2019s third quarter 2015 earnings call. With me today are Sandy Cutler, Chairman and CEO; Craig Arnold, Chief Operating Officer and President; and Rick Fearon, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer. Our agenda today includes opening remarks by Sandy, highlighting the Company\u2019s performance in the third quarter along with our outlook for the remainder of 2015 and some preliminary thoughts on 2016. As we\u2019ve done on our past calls, we\u2019ll be taking questions at the end of Sandy\u2019s comments. The press release from our earnings announcement this morning and the presentation we\u2019ll go through today have been posted on our website at www.eaton.com. Please note that both the press release and the presentation include reconciliations to non-GAAP measures. And a webcast to this call is accessible on our website will be available for replay. Before we get started, I\u2019d like to remind you that our comments today do include statements related to expected future results of the Company and as so, should be therefore be treated as forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our forecasts or projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties and those are described in both earnings release, the presentation and also in the related 8-K. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Sandy. Sandy Cutler : Great. Thanks Don, and I\u2019m going to work from the presentation we posted earlier this morning, and if I could ask you all to turn to page three of that presentation that\u2019s entitled highlights of Q3 results. Couple of comments in terms of our third quarter results. So, we\u2019re with our margins, we\u2019re particularly pleased with the great cost control and all the restructuring work that\u2019s going on across the Company. And that allowed us to offset the lower volumes that we had outlined in our earnings revision just a week and a half ago as well as more negative FX. I think the big news is that we continued markets. And as you saw, our weaker bookings have really caused us to drop our second half guidance. And I\u2019ll talk more about the implications for that for 2016 as well. Our operating earnings per share we reported at this morning at $0.97 was in line with our revised guidance. As you saw, our sales were down a 9% with 6 points of those 9 points due to ForEx the other three organic revenue decline. Segment margins of 14.5% that\u2019s a little bit below the 15% that we had guided to original life of the third quarter and that\u2019s really due simply to the volume impact being down as far as it was from our expectation. I think the very good news is when you take out the net restructuring impact, and I\u2019ll be talking more about those restructuring plans as I go through my comments this morning, our margins were 16.2%. Those net restructuring costs, so that\u2019s the costs minus the benefits for about $98 million in the quarter, about $8 million higher than we had provided in our guidance for the third quarter. So that\u2019s all really due to timing and as you all see as we talk through those results for this morning. We really quite pleased with the overall restructuring program and it\u2019s actually going to drive even more benefits that we had shared with you initially. A quarterly record operating cash flow; really pleased with that $973 million, obviously a reflection of the work we\u2019re doing in terms of not only improving profitability but also really pulling dollars out of our working capital. And doing that allowed us during the quarter to buy back about $284 million of shares. That brings our year-to-date repurchases to $454 million. That\u2019s about 1.5% of our outstanding shares. And I know you\u2019ll all recall that in 2014, we also bought back about 650 million shares. If I could ask you to turn to the next chart entitled financial summary. One number -- I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve looked at these already but I wanted o reference on this chart is if you look in the green box in the lower left hand corner, our organic sales of negative 3, if we go back and look at the second quarter, our organic sales were up positive 1. And this really reflects I think well what we\u2019re seeing in the downshift in the number of our end markets where we saw positive organic growth in the first half and now we\u2019re seeing negative growth here in the second half. If we turn to the next page and let\u2019s talk through our five reporting segments. I\u2019m on a page titled Electrical Products Segment. Really great margin performance here this quarter. As you can see, we reported 18.5%. And if we don\u2019t include again the net restructuring and the savings that came from that, 19%, I think really demonstrating the strong performance and margin position and cost position we have in this business. Again this business is a third of the Company, so it\u2019s really significant for us. The bookings were flat this quarter. And I think if you look back over the last several quarters, you recall that in the second quarter, they were 4%; in the first quarter they were 5%; then all during the previous year, they were 4%, 5% or 6%. So, clearly we\u2019ve seen a downshift. As we\u2019ve talked with so many of our distributors around the world, they have been seeing a slowing in their end demand. They clearly are not comfortable taking on more inventory in this environment. And we saw this slow as we went through the third quarter. And so I\u2019ll comment more about that when we get to our fourth quarter guidance. Still positive in the Americas and in Europe but Asia was particularly weak, and it was not simply China; we saw weakness across the region. We told you in our second quarter conference call, we would share with you the specific restructuring costs and the benefits by segment. You see them detailed here. So, I simply won\u2019t go through repeating them. I think you\u2019ll they are stayed on a consistent basis as we go through each of the segments here. When we get inside the bookings, the strength has been where hit has been historically, a strong residential here in the U.S., strong lighting activity, weak industrial, weak oil and gas. We get into the Middle East and Europe; clearly the Middle East is the strongest of that region. We also saw some pretty good demand in the single phase UPS market. And then Asia was basically weak across the board and was the primary reason that the total bookings were flat instead of slightly positive. If we go to the next chart labeled Electrical Systems & Services Segment, again a large segment for the Company, about 28% of the overall Company. And if you look at this particular chart, I want to call out a couple items. Let me start with the organic growth again in the lower left hand green box. It was a negative 4% last quarter, negative 5% this year. Again if you look at the bookings being down 3%, and if you back just last several quarters and look at the trends there, it was down 7% in the second quarter; it was flat in both the first and in the fourth quarter -- fourth quarter of last year. So we\u2019ve been seeing weakness in this segment, it has continued. You\u2019ll recall that we report our Crouse-Hinds business in this segment which has a very large oil and gas exposure. We\u2019ve also seen weakness in the power quality market this year and the utility market\u2019s been pretty flattish this year. Finally, we\u2019re seeing that the large industrial projects within the overall construction market remain weak. And that\u2019s an area that also affects this particular business. Bright spots in the quarter for us where we saw our systems business and bookings up very substantially. That\u2019s something we normally look for in the third quarter because there is quite a lot of work that gets completed during the fourth quarter for many of our customers and also on the private side as well as on the government side. And we were pleased and in spite of fairly flattish conditions in the utility area, we had a good quarter of booking there, our one of the stronger areas. And then finally, our own three-phase UPS business, these tend to go into these larger installations, had a very good quarter of bookings as well. Crouse however was down very substantially and that obviously affects the margin. So, if you flip up to the margins here and you compare the third quarter to fourth quarter, you\u2019ll see that we reported margins of 11.2%. Without the restructuring costs and the restructuring savings, they were 12.8% but a 180 basis points lower than last year. And I would say really the factors I mentioned in bookings are exactly what is influencing the margins here that\u2019s the weaker mix and activity for Crouse oil and gas related, it\u2019s the weaker activity from the industrial side, and then we have not had strong bookings for couple of quarters, so they were operating at lower utilization levels. If we move then on next chart labeled Hydraulics Segment, about 12% of our Company. I don\u2019t think much new news here from what we\u2019ve been chatting with you all about here as these markets continue to be weak, commodity markets across the board around the world are weak. If we simply look at the bookings number are down 13%, not a whole lot different region to region around the world, nor is it substantially different between OEMs and distributors, as you can see in the comment below. Within the overall mobile area is again as mentioned, most of these commodity markets continued to be weak and on the stationary side clearly oil and gas are still a negative. Last quarter, again if I can ask you to look at the green box on the left, organic growth was negative 11% this quarter and negative 10%. And you can see in the yellow box, the magnitude of the restructuring that we\u2019re doing in this business to respond to these weaker markets. You can obviously see that\u2019s significantly affected the reported margin versus the margin without our restructuring costs and benefits. If we move to the next chart, Aerospace, about 90% of the Company, really good quarter. I think when you look at the margin performance, whether it\u2019s the 17.6% that we reported or the 18.7% that would not include the restructuring costs and the benefits. Bookings down some 16%, not different than you\u2019re seeing from most of the companies in the aerospace industry during this quarter. OEM activity order placement on both the commercial and the military side weak, whether it\u2019s a matter of comparables or whether it\u2019s a matter of weak, it was a weak quarter. The one bright spot here, a couple of you have noted was in aftermarket, up solid 11%. And we are making progress towards getting the aftermarket business up toward that historic mix of 40% of total. Again restructuring not as much elsewhere really responding primarily to as programs start to diminish or come to a lower level in this industry. We\u2019re obviously tuning our manpower and structural costs as well. If we could move to the next chart, the Vehicle Segment, about 18% of Eaton. You can see another very strong quarter in terms of margin performance, 15.2% and then 18.2% when we take out the restructuring costs and benefits. Our organic growth was a negative 3; you\u2019ll recall, it was negative 4 last quarter. We are seeing a downshift in terms of NAFTA heavy duty truck market build. If I could comment on that just for a moment, you\u2019ve known that our forecast throughout this year has been 330,000 units. We think it\u2019s coming off here in the fourth quarter. We have dropped our forecast to 325, so a reduction of 5,000 units. And if you look at the third quarter production rate of roughly 83,000 units, our best estimate at this time is it\u2019ll come down to about 74,000 units in the fourth quarter, so down about 11% quarter-to-quarter. And you get a sense for that when you look at the whole third quarter NAFTA Class 8 orders were about 65,000 for the industry and the backlog has come down approximately 20,000 units during this last quarter. If we move to chart 10, if we look at our markets this year and we review our organic growth, we do expect -- and I\u2019ll cover more of this on the next chart that our organic revenues will shrink about 1% this year. And that\u2019s driven by our markets coming down approximately 2% during 2015 compared to 2014 and that we will outgrow them by about 1. So that\u2019s how we get the net of a negative 1%. They\u2019re detailed here in terms of the total organic growth segment-by-segment. I won\u2019t go through each of those. I\u2019ll be glad to answer the questions little later this morning. And the next chart, our chart 11, which is labeled 2015 Segment Operating Margin Expectations. You\u2019ll recall when we provided segment margin, a guidance at the end of the second quarter; the segment guidance we gave you did not include the restructuring costs or benefits because we had not yet announced those specific plans internally. These now do, and to help you kind of bridge between the last quarter and this current quarter, the electrical products margins here are affected about by about 20 basis points from the restructuring and savings Electrical Systems and Services, similar at about 20 basis points, Hydraulics at 80 basis points, Aerospace at 20 basis points, Vehicle at 60 and then the total consolidated at 30. So, you obviously can get a feel of the biggest restructuring that we\u2019re doing proportional to the businesses are in Hydraulics and in Vehicle at this point. If we turn to the next chart, and I want to spend a little bit of time on this chart and the next chart to be sure that how we have displayed our restructuring is easy for you to understand. Let me start with just a couple of summary comments. Program is on track that we announced to you at the end of the second quarter; it is indeed going to produce even more savings than we had shared with you, at that time. We are reducing our employment by approximately 2,900 employees; we\u2019re closing eight manufacturing plants. And if you look at this particular chart, you will see that -- you\u2019ve got the actual numbers displayed for both costs and savings and you can see that we actually had higher net cost of about $8 million in the third quarter than we had in our plan, that\u2019s the 98 million versus the 90 million. We do expect in the fourth quarter that we will have slightly higher net savings and that\u2019s the result obviously you see us taking our savings in that quarter up by $10 million. And if you shift to 2016, you will see the difference that we\u2019ll spend about $5 million more than we thought originally, but we\u2019re going to get about $20 million more savings that\u2019s the $100 million versus the $80 million. So, when you go to the bottom of this chart and we say total restructuring program that we announced at the end of the second quarter, we\u2019ll have a program cost of approximately $153 million, up $8 million, $3 million of the $8 million occurs in 2015, $5 million of the $8 million occurs in 2016. Similarly when you look at the savings of $150 million; of the $25 million of increase of savings, 5 million occurs in 2015, $20 million in 2016. So, that is the program that we\u2019ve announced to you, again about 2,900 employees and closing eight manufacturing plants. But based upon what we have seen, if we could go to the next page, it\u2019s labeled With Continuation of Weaker Markets. We had originally shared with you on our second quarter conference call when we were talking about 2016 that in these weak market conditions, we would ordinarily undertake about $50 million to $60 million of restructuring on an annual basis. We have mentioned that to you so that if you were trying to look at estimates of respective earnings next year, you wouldn\u2019t drop restructuring out of the program. What we had not shared with you is what the anticipated savings it would come from that $50 million to $60 million will do. So today what we\u2019re doing with this second set of actions which is labeled on this chart, the 2016 program, it is a second set of actions; it\u2019s not any of the same actions that we were taking before; these are actions in addition to those actions, is that we\u2019re going to increase the expected cost of restructuring for these new actions from $50 million to $60 million to $90 million to $100 million. So if you\u2019ve taken the midpoint of $50 to $60 and had $55 in your estimates and you now take the midpoint of 90 to 100, you have 95; it\u2019s about $40 million more restructuring next year than we had provided you before. We do expect over a two-year time period that we\u2019ll get dollar-for-dollar benefits for this $95 million. So, if you see on this chart and if you look to the second line from the bottom that\u2019s in the green box, you see that we expect to get $40 million of savings in 2016 and we\u2019ll get the full 95 by the second year, in 2017. So again, we have two sets of actions, the set of actions which was announced at the end of the second quarter that is resulting in reducing employment by 2,900 people and eight manufacturing plants being closed; and a new supplemental set of actions labeled here as 2016 program. When you add the two together, you\u2019ll see that from 2015 to 2016, there is a year-to-year benefit of $138 million. Then when you move from 2016 to 2017, there is a year-to-year benefit of $190 million. Now, I would urge you, don\u2019t use the whole $190 million in your estimates because there will be some regular restructuring action that will go on within the Company as it does on an ordinary basis, in 2017. I think for planning purposes, you might assume that that could be on the order of $50 million to $60 million, so a midpoint of $55 million, and then we might get on the order of $25 million of cost. I mentioned those numbers not because they are our forecasts but we don\u2019t want you to simply drop any net cost estimate which is probably on the order of about 30 million bucks out of this comparison, so you might take that $190 million and reduce it to a net of something on the order of $160 million. So, I hope that\u2019s helpful. I know Don will be able to walk through this individually with you. I understand it can be a little confusing when you think about initial set of actions and a second set of actions. But clearly the reason we\u2019re undertaking an even larger set of additional actions prospectively here in 2016 is the fact that these markets have fallen off more than we had anticipated at the middle of this year as I\u2019ll detail in just a moment; we think we\u2019re likely to see continued shrinkage of our markets in 2016. So, we are working hard to get out ahead of these reductions in markets with these very aggressive and I think well led out and being very well executed restructuring programs. With that as a base, let\u2019s move to chart 14, which is labeled Operating EPS Guidance. Our guidance for the fourth quarter is the $1.05 to a $1.15 operating EPS. And probably the two most significant items here in terms of our thinking on this is, we think organic revenues will come down another 3% from third quarter level. This is not year-to-year; this is compared to the third quarter. And we get there really that\u2019s more than what normally happens if you look at our seasonal patterns by the fact that we\u2019ve seen bookings obviously decelerate in this last quarter. And we continue to hear from specific markets, I cited one but it\u2019s just one, the heavy duty truck market, that there are many more days being scheduled now to be closed from our customers than they were just three months ago. And so we\u2019re basing our guidance that our organic revenue will come off 3%; the tax rate will be between 5% to 6% and the reason that\u2019s lower than we\u2019ve run in some of the other quarters is that our best estimate is we\u2019re going to have a lower mix of income in some of the high tax countries. And some of you may have seen just yesterday the recent reduction in the UK tax rate and there is a legislation going through on that. And so we\u2019ve tried to pick the benefit of that as well. And then last very importantly, the very prudent actions that we kicked off earlier this year in the second quarter are going to allow us to have a net restructuring benefit between the third quarter and the fourth quarter of $123 million as was detailed on the previous chart and that\u2019s about $0.25 that gives us -- helps our run rate during the fourth quarter. That brings our full year guidance to $4.20 to $4.30 operating EPS and that does include the full net restructuring charge from this initial set of actions that we announced at the end of the second of $73 million net charge or net impact of the negative $0.14. Next page titled 2015 Outlook Summary, just the basic summary that we provide you here. Obviously the big change on this one is that we had thought in July that our organic revenue growth would be zero to negative 1 and it\u2019s clearly going to be negative 1. We\u2019ve been working really hard on all of our expenses in the Company, so that whole collection of pension, interest general corporate expense we believe will be $30 million below last year that\u2019s more than we had told you before and the tax rate is a little lower. And then very importantly with all this change, if you look at the operating cash flow, we had told you 2.4 billion to 2.8 billion at the end of July and that is still our guidance for this year. The team\u2019s really doing a great job in that regard. And because we\u2019re operating at lower levels of activity, we\u2019ve taken another $100 million out of CapEx, not unlike many industrial firms in this weaker environment that we just don\u2019t need to spend that extra capital. So we actually have taken our guidance up for free cash flow in spite of all this weakness by $100 million. So, it was $1.8 billion to $2.2 billion, it\u2019s now $1.9 billion to $2.3 billion. So, if we turn to next chart, 2015 Summary, I covered most of these points. Organic growth at about 1% that assumes our markets go down. It clearly reflects what I\u2019ve been commenting on in terms of the slowdown here over the back half of the year. I already commented on the restructuring program, and that the operating margins are depressed by above 30 basis points for the net restructuring impact. We have repurchased 7.2 million shares through the third quarter of this year. We will pay down this large tranche that we\u2019ve talked about for some time of $600 million of debt in November. And I think the really good news is, based upon the strong cash flow, we were able to do this level of repurchasing in the third quarter and we\u2019ve got the flexibility to continue to repurchase in the fourth quarter if we deem that\u2019s prudent. Last chart is very important looking forward. And clearly I think this is the Ouija ball that we are all trying to get a good handle on currently in terms of with the second half of this year having them slower, what are the implications for 2016. And clearly my comments here very inform our decision to go ahead with an even larger second set of actions in terms of restructuring in the Company. We expect our markets in 2016 compared to 2015 to be slightly negative. And our best thinking -- and please don\u2019t put a decimal point on this, this early time because we\u2019re in the process of trying to get all of this tuned up ourselves, is it\u2019s likely to be on the order of down to 1% to 2%. This year it was down 2%. And as you try to think through our businesses, because I can hear each of your enquiries of can you give me some color about how might that lay out across your different businesses. Our best thinking -- but please, it is initial thinking at this point, is that to support that we think that the electric business be up on the order of 1, hydraulic is going to have another down year, we think on the order of roughly 7, aerospace will continue to be strong on the order of about 3 positive and vehicle will come off about 5 and we\u2019re anticipating that the North America heavy duty class 8 business comes off about 15% from this year\u2019s 325. Now, all of that frankly would get you to a number that feels a little bit more than just one, I think prudence, having watched what\u2019s happened to markets this year is what leads us to believe that we need to be planning based on a negative 1 to negative 2. We\u2019ll obviously have more to say about that as we work through our profit plans and share guidance with you after the New Year. The restructuring program highlights just what I talked to you before. The way to read this chart is -- because we didn\u2019t get the labeling quite correct on the little small bullet under the restructuring year-to-year benefits is between 2015 and 2016, we get the $138 million of benefit; between 2016 and 2017, we get a $190 million of incremental savings but remember by caveat, you probably want to take that 190 and reduce it to something closer to 160 because it is highly likely the Company would continue to do some former restructuring on an annual basis which is sort of normal fair. The Cooper integration savings of about $45 million; the free cash flow up from 2015 by 10% to 15%. And you say how can you feel relatively confident about that? We will not have a U.S. qualified pension contribution; it won\u2019t be required in January. Recall, last year it was about 200 million. If you look at our guidance for this year and take the midpoint of 2.1 billion, 200 million over 2.1 billion gets you pretty close to 10%. And so, we obviously think we\u2019ll do a little better than that. We do have one more debt repayment in January of 2016; we\u2019ve disclosed this to you before, 240 million. And then the really good news is that as we\u2019ve shared with you at midyear in 2015, we\u2019re going to continue to have very strong cash flow. You saw that in our third quarter, really exceptional cash flow. That\u2019s going to give us the capacity to deploy over $1 billion of capital through either stock repurchases or acquisition. And we\u2019ve a strong bias toward repurchases, obviously with our price -- stock price into the range of this at this point. So in total, I would say that I think we\u2019re being realistic about what\u2019s happening in our end-markets. We are taking the restructuring actions, both with the first set of actions we took and now the second set which will kick off next year. As the timing, we would expect to kick off those restructuring actions, the new actions we\u2019ve talked about in 2016, will get at them early in the year that means probably the first quarter which obviously means that we can pull more savings into the year as well. The company is really focused on getting cost down to ensure that obviously we can be competitive and produce the kind of returns that we hold ourselves accountable to as well. And so with that Don, I\u2019ll turn things back to you and look forward to everybody\u2019s questions. Don Bullock : Before we begin the Q&A and have the operator guide for the Q&A portion of the call today, we do have a number of individuals that are queued with questions. Given our time constrains of an hour for the call today and our desire to get as many of those questions as possible voiced, please limit your questions to the single question and a follow-up. And thanks in advanced for your cooperation. With that I\u2019ll turn it over to the operator to provide guidance on the Q&A. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Don Bullock : With that our first question comes from Scott Davis with Barclays. Scott Davis : Can you give us a sense of what your view is on -- I guess the first part of the question is your benefit from price cost in the quarter. But probably more importantly, what your view is, as you look out in 2016 on potential price weakness in some of your markets? Sandy Cutler : I think let me start with the commodity side. We continue to believe we\u2019re in a period of weak commodity and obviously to inform some of the demand side for us in our hydraulics business, we don\u2019t see -- and of course we\u2019ll all guess wrong when the interest rates will begin to start to be increased but it feels like that\u2019s coming sooner rather than later. We don\u2019t see pressure on the commodity side. Hence, we don\u2019t see a lot of pricing actions that are likely to be successful out in the marketplace. So relatively neutral in that regard. I think the key is going to be for us all to understand when that commodity pressure starts to come back. But we\u2019re not seeing any evidence of that at the present time. Scott Davis : And can you quantify the benefit that you saw this quarter on price cost spread? Sandy Cutler : I wouldn\u2019t say we were seeing a benefit because in terms of we can\u2019t do it -- I think you know our mode; we tend to keep our pricing pretty much in line with the commodity side. So, we\u2019ve not been getting net price increase, if you will. Scott Davis : And just quickly, any color you have for us on U.S. non-res? I mean it seems like it\u2019s still reasonably good but you\u2019re outlook there? Sandy Cutler : On the light side, if I could cut it into maybe three pieces, on the light side and that\u2019s the portion that was attached to residential, I would say continues to be quite strong and looks a lot like the residential demand. On the really large commercial projects, not all that strong. On the industrial large projects that\u2019s where the weakness has been. And if you look at the Dodge reports, part of the reason we commented in our press release that we saw bookings get weaker through the quarter. Some of the Dodge information about future activity has been concerning. We don\u2019t think that means that we\u2019re going to see a negative number from non-res. So, we do think it may not grow quite as quickly as it has been. Don Bullock : Our next comes from Steve Winoker with Bernstein. Steve Winoker : Couple of questions. First, on the 2016 thinking, assuming that organic growth does come in, let\u2019s say flat at best or a little bit down for you specifically, what kind of incremental margins do you think you can hold excluding the restructuring and excluding the Cooper synergies? Sandy Cutler : Yes, we\u2019ve not -- you\u2019re right on point with the question, Steve, and we\u2019ve not really tuned it formally at this point. But we\u2019re getting down this far in the cycle, earlier on we were able to hold 20% decrementals; we think it\u2019s more on the order of 30 but we\u2019ll have a better chance as we get out. That\u2019s obviously why we\u2019ve been launching the restructuring we have. I think there always are capacity issues any company that has sort of knees in them and both in the way up and the way down. And with this having come down this far we need to take another knee out. So I think for planning you might use 30% at this point. Steve Winoker : And then on the Cooper side, am I correct in looking at the $45 million of integration savings you put on slide 17, is that comparable to the 115 you talked about before? Sandy Cutler : You\u2019re absolutely correct. And two issues that are leading to lower synergy as we get out here towards the end of the four-year time period. The first is with the lower volumes that we\u2019re seeing -- we had obviously hoped we would see some market growth with this time period. There is a scaling effect on procurement and plant savings. We also have experienced negative CapEx and it\u2019s not only affecting the base business, it\u2019s also affecting the synergy. And frankly, we just had enrolled it through to the synergies. And as we\u2019ve been tuning all those stuff, it was clear to us that we had missed the piece of that as it has to do with the synergies. The last has to do with the oil and gas industry, as well as three regions that have really slowed far more than others. Canada as you know is really been hit very hard in terms of being a natural resource area. Latin America, let me just say, it\u2019s been gutted and leave it right there. And those are the issues that have led to the change. So, we do think at this point, a more realistic number for next year is about $45 million incremental savings over this year. Once again, Steve, that all informs part of our feeling for why we\u2019ve got to do more restructuring. Steve Winoker : And is most of that cost savings now or is there any revenue in that 45? Sandy Cutler : There is a very little revenue. Most of it coming right out of the large plant closings that we\u2019re finishing up. Don Bullock : Our next question comes from Ann Duignan with JP Morgan. Ann Duignan : Just a follow-up, quick question on the Copper synergies. Can you just remind us, Sandy, what were the synergies for 2015 versus 150 million as expected? Sandy Cutler : We think they will be on the order of about 135 million versus the 150 million and then we think next year it\u2019s this 45 million versus the 115 million. Ann Duignan : And then my question is really around Brazil and the impact that financing programs might have on -- particularly on your vehicle business. How are you thinking about that both into year-end and for 2016? Sandy Cutler : We have been a bear on the Brazilian economy, as you know for a couple of years. And while I think it\u2019s salutatory that they are trying to find some ways to turn the economy, our base assumption is that Brazil continues to be weaker next year than this year. And we just think there are so many macroeconomic issues that have to be addressed, we\u2019re not planning on an upturn effect; we\u2019re planning on it still sliding some more in 2016 versus 2015. Ann Duignan : And that\u2019s embedded in your hydraulic outlook I presume; are there any other businesses? Sandy Cutler : Hydraulic and vehicle. Ann Duignan : And vehicle? Okay, thank you. Don Bullock : Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Jeff Sprague : I was wondering first just on working capital, Sandy or Rick, if you can give us a little bit of color how much you actually got out in the quarter and what kind of opportunity that is in the next year? Rick Fearon : Jeff, we\u2019re just shy of 300 million from Q2 to Q3 and change in I guess what you talk classic working capital, we really put a full court press on receivables and manage down inventory but we think much more is possible partly because when you\u2019re sales slide off is very hard to keep the inventories going down in line with unexpected sales decline. So, we would look into next year and view additional opportunities for working capital liquidation and we also do have inventories -- bank inventories we built up for some of these Cooper plant consolidations and we would expect that most of those would be removed by the end of the year. So, I think you\u2019ll see continued strong management of working capital. Jeff Sprague : And then maybe flipping it more to the customer level, Sandy, you made a comment about inventories at the customer level. It seems pretty clear there has been a drawdown going on across a lot of these channels. Do you think your customers are properly sized to current state of end demand or is there still more inventory liquidation that needs to take place in these channels? Sandy Cutler : Let me talk to the two channels if I could, Jeff. I agree with your comment on the distributor issue. I think that industry was maybe buying in a little too strongly in the first quarter and second quarter. And as things began to back up here in the second half, they are obviously not buying or trying to window down our inventory. And our feedback is they\u2019ve got little bit more to do before they\u2019re going to really feel they\u2019re going to optimally sized. When you get out to the end markets, some of these end markets have been week for quite some time and you would hope that they are starting to get it right. But our view is when markets are falling off like this, it usually takes a while for people to catch up and get right-sized. And so that\u2019s all kind of big into our view in a number of these markets in 2016, we\u2019re still going to see some negative numbers on the growth side. Don\u2019t know that we\u2019re going to be absolutely right on that, but we think we\u2019re better to plan with that outlook and we\u2019ll get the cost out of the Company, and we can manage up if we need to. If we\u2019re wrong in this market, it\u2019s always harder to manage down. Don Bullock : Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse. Julian Mitchell : I may just -- your point around capital deployment is more buyback focused, but just taking a step back, the EPS top line is down a bit, your earnings next year 4ish or so. So that\u2019s the way you were before the Cooper acquisition back in 2011. So, I just wanted how happy you\u2019re with the current state of portfolio, or if your view is that times are tough, so we take out cost for new buybacks and then maybe in a couple of years time where there is clearer macro, you can do something with the portfolio? Sandy Cutler : Without giving confirmation one way or the other to your 4 number, I would say our focus right now is that we\u2019re seeing markets have weakened and we need to get the cost out of our overall corporate portfolio that\u2019s at the corporate level and each of our individual businesses. And we think with the stock not creating at the levels that we think it\u2019s worth, we need to get this cost right so we\u2019re in a position to drive earnings growth in 2016 over 2015. We\u2019ve not finished our planning on that. But that is our primary focus right now is to drive the restructuring program. We have a singular focus on getting these costs right at this point. We\u2019ll continue to look at the issues of portfolio, as I\u2019ve mentioned a couple of times, there is nothing that prevents us from making changes in our portfolio on a taxable basis at this point. Part of that change is then when we get out to November 2007 when we have other alternatives that are available to us. But I would say for right now Julian our primary focus that we are driving with single minded purposes across the Company is to get our cost right. Julian Mitchell : And then just a follow-up on the ESS business, margins under pressure for those volumes I guess. Is anything happening there on pricing on some of the large projects activity as well, or is it just a volume driven mix phenomenon? Sandy Cutler : I\u2019d say a couple of things, Julian, remember that is the sector where we put Crouse-Hinds in and you may recall when we gave our guidance for this year and indicated that about 6% of Eaton\u2019s revenues are in oil and gas, and that we expected that marker would be off about 25%, we\u2019d also said that we thought the primary impact of that would be in the second half of 2015 and that is indeed what we\u2019re experiencing. While bookings weakened early in the year, we really seeing that impact come through in terms of the shipment side. So that\u2019s the first area. Second area has been this continued weakness in what I would call power systems and in the power quality three-phase market on shipments. We are encouraged that there is some fairly significant projects that we think will indeed be built and shipped -- they\u2019ll be asking us to ship on next year. So, we see that three-phase issue potentially turning around next year. And the last but not least is the industrial construction big projects have been weaker this year. That\u2019s part of what\u2019s infecting this as well. And so whenever -- and I\u2019ve candid before that whenever you see weakness in these end markets, you do get more price competition. And so, there is more of a beta of that. And I would say the industry is operating at lower levels of utilization right now. Don Bullock : Our next question comes from Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc. Jeff Hammond : So, I know it\u2019s early on \u201816 when you give some color on the segments. But just given the downtick in orders in electrical, what\u2019s the comfort level that you do get growth there in to \u201816 and maybe where do you have the most confidence that you will see that growth? Sandy Cutler : Jeff, obviously we\u2019re in the midst of all of our planning and once we start trying to pull that string of yarn, we\u2019re into an awful lot of detail that we don\u2019t feel we\u2019ve got fully vetted enough. I think the biggest issue to think about in electrical is what\u2019s happened in the second half in terms of distributors destocking. And at some point we all know that that comes to a conclusion and you get rid of that negative impact. But there is so many end markets there. I did mention before that we do think that residential will continue to expand. And certainly that area of non-residential that surrounds residential, so that light side looks pretty solid. And then I did mention that we\u2019re seeing some better activity obviously out ahead of us in terms of the power quality markets. But I think beyond that we need to really finish the reviews that Craig and I are heavily involved in, in terms of looking at the operating plans for this next year. And we\u2019ll have a better set of insights when we give you our full guidance for next year. Don Bullock : Next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC. Deane Dray : With regard to the second phase of the restructuring plan, was there any consideration to doing some of that now in the fourth quarter and get a jump start on this? Sandy Cutler : Yes clearly, we obviously have thought that through very, Deane. Part of this is the issue of just how much capacity there is to do how much all at one time, and that\u2019s what we really felt. And our best judgment is laid out the right sequence for trying to assure that we not only forecast savings but that we indeed execute them well. So, Company has been really busy during the third and fourth quarter getting this first group done. And we\u2019ll kick off with second group as I said most likely right in the first quarter. But we really felt that was the right timing and we\u2019re trying to be transparent about the fact as to how the timing of these will feel through. But that\u2019s our best estimate, the best way to do this. Deane Dray : And then just so we have a perspective on how the third quarter did play out, can you share with us the cadence of the months on an organic basis and how you arrived at the decision that you did need to negatively pre-announce? Sandy Cutler : What we had indicated in a number of forms both Craig and Rick and I were in sometimes together and sometimes in different locations is that we saw July and August continue to be very slow. And as we came through the end of August, it was evident that September was going to have to really strengthen substantially. Now, it did strengthen but it didn\u2019t strengthen enough and that\u2019s where Rick was out at a conference in the middle of September, we shared at that point that we were concerned that revenues looked like they were going to fall short. We\u2019re right in the midst obviously of working through all of those actions that we had announced in restructuring from the second quarter. But at that point, we believe be looking at whether we were going to need more in terms of restructuring to get cost down. So that\u2019s sort of how it laid out over the time period. I\u2019d say September was a good month and it\u2019s always a disproportionately big month in the third quarter. It just didn\u2019t come through like we thought it would. And it wasn\u2019t in just one business. I\u2019ve had that question from a number of investors as was the 300 million just in one line of business. No, it was fairly broadly. And so, our concern that we think we\u2019re correctly responding to is that this is a general slowdown and then you GDP numbers come out lower than people thought again; you saw the industrial production numbers come out now lower than people thought and not seeing a lot of different news from around the world. So, we\u2019re trying to get ahead of this as fast as we can. And no one likes having negative markets but the way you deal with them as you get the cost out and you manage your cash and you be sure you\u2019ve got a strong balance sheet for this time period. And that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re doing. Don Bullock : Our next question comes from Shannon O\u2019Callaghan with UBS. Shannon O\u2019Callaghan: Maybe one for Rick, just initially. You talked about the UK tax change; you also have BEPS going on. Maybe just an update on the implications of recent global tax activity and how we should think about any implications for Eaton going forward? Rick Fearon : You\u2019re right to focus on some of these changes. It is interesting that despite the BEPS initiative, you still have places like the UK in the process of lowering their tax rate. So, it is an evolving tableau. The impact from BEPS, frankly, is going to turn out we believe to mainly for us be around all the additional information requirements, the filings for the calendar year 2016 of detailed country-by-country tax reports and increase in required transfer pricing documentation. So that\u2019s going to require some extra manpower, some extra efforts. We think we have a good plan to do that cost effectively. And we are working right now to put all those resources in place. I think you\u2019ll also see additional audit activity just because that\u2019s been focus we\u2019ve seen over the last year around the world that countries are needing more revenue, so they\u2019re going to do more audit. So I think that\u2019s another part. All-in-all though the biggest impact on Eaton year-to-year let\u2019s say from 2015 to 2016 is simply likely to be mix, where the income is actually earned and we don\u2019t yet have a good handle on mix for 2016. It is possible that our rate could move up a small amount from the 7 to 9 that we expect right now, but I wouldn\u2019t expect anything very dramatic. Shannon O\u2019Callaghan: And then on the hydraulic, minus 8% new organic guidance for the year, it seems like that implies a somewhat more favorable 4Q before we start to get worse again next year. Is there anything going on in the fourth quarter that I\u2019m missing on hydraulic? Sandy Cutler : No. And Craig, maybe you want to comment. Craig Arnold : No, I would say no. I think if you take a look at how hydraulics performed during the course of 2014, I think you\u2019ll find that Q4 2014 was also quite a low quarter. So, I think the denominator in this case helps a bit but we certainly are and when we take a look at the sequential performance of hydraulics, what we\u2019re forecasting is that Q4 will in fact be weaker than Q3. And if you take a look at the seasonality of the business, it\u2019s consistent with what we seen in prior years. And we\u2019re not assuming any of our end markets get any better. Don Bullock : Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Nigel Coe : So obviously Sandy, recognizing that you\u2019re still in the midst of plan of the next year, the detail you\u2019ve given is really helpful. Just if next year doesn\u2019t turn out to be a down 1% to 2% type of situation for Eaton, it feels like you\u2019ve taken enough cost out to achieve your aim of growing earnings next year. Is there anything from a mix perspective or maybe from a pension or tax that maybe hold earnings flat to maybe down next year with these reconstruction actions in place? Sandy Cutler : Yes, we don\u2019t -- at this point again, it\u2019s really early Nigel but we don\u2019t see any headwinds if you will in those areas, and little too early to call whether they all be positive. But we\u2019re relatively confident they are not headwinds in those particular areas. So I think your premise is right. Nigel Coe : And then just picking up on Deane\u2019s question about how the quarter played out, as we went into October, did some of that relatively good news from September filter through into October? And how would you describe your confidence levels on the down 3% for 4Q which is obviously in line with 3Q but down 3 for 4Q in light of the possibility of extended holiday shutdowns. Do you think there is a bias to the upside or the downside the number or based on your visibility today either in backlog or trends you\u2019re seeing today the down 3 feels really good. Sandy Cutler : Typically where we\u2019ll see this practice and we\u2019ve talked about this in previous years where major OEM customer of ours will decide on either the Thanksgiving or the Christmas holidays to add a couple of days of shutdown. We tended to see that in our vehicle business; we\u2019ve tended to see that in our hydraulics business. And so we\u2019re starting to hear and we did during the month of October what I\u2019ll call a little bit of rolling thunder in terms of people adding additional days. Normal our experience has been when people start to add a couple, they are going to add a couple more. And so our 3% is more than we would normally see our fourth quarter revenues come down from the third quarter. We\u2019re trying to be very realistic about in a market that -- in a economy that appears to be slowing and more so, clearly on the industrial side than what I am going to call the retail consumer side that we\u2019ve got to anticipate that. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve tried to say we\u2019ve got to learn to live within 3% volume down is the most likely case here for the fourth quarter. We\u2019ll know more week by week because these things tend to -- they don\u2019t give you a lot of warning. But I\u2019d say our history tells us this is likely to be a whole lot closer to the negative 3 than just the flat quarter-to-quarter. Don Bullock : The next question comes from John Inch with Deutsche Bank. John Inch : Could we get a little more color on just the broad based Asian weakness in electrical? And maybe just what\u2019s going on under the hood in that region; is it starting in China and spread or just anything Sandy that maybe you sort of observed there throughout the quarter that could lead to some conclusion one way or another? Sandy Cutler : Maybe a couple of items, John. You\u2019ve heard us say before is that we actually think that manufacturing IP in China is growing much slower than has been stated. Having said that, now you look within it and look what\u2019s going on, most of the infrastructure projects have been pulled back. There is not much manufacturing capacity. And many people are talking about the construction side -- I\u2019m talking commercial construction that has gotten much slower. We\u2019re not seeing the export; this will be machine tool activity, be particularly strong either and that has to do with the receiving countries, not being that strong. And last but not least, the corruption investigations that resulted in a lot of practices that are -- let say, it\u2019s causing delay in projects and it\u2019s causing very intense price construction because they\u2019re really trying to sure of price pressures because they\u2019re trying to be sure that there are not reasons that awards are being made at a higher price level, be it for futures quality delivery, none of that is accepted at this point. So, I\u2019d say China is -- I think you\u2019ve seen it from just about everyone was reported on the industrial side has had a very weak third quarter, and it doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s going to be significantly different next quarter. I\u2019d say if you go down through Indonesia, Malaysia, wherever else, clearly the oil situation is acting as a depressant in that particular area. You get up into Korea and of course there\u2019re not a whole lot of ships being built currently and you\u2019re seeing this back up again. And so, we\u2019re not a real big player in Indian market. And so I would site those three as the primary reasons where same things be slow in that area. John Inch : Sandy, since you\u2019ve been CEO, you\u2019ve seen a couple of U.S. recessions, maybe in 2001 it was little more traditional and 2008 was a credit crisis. And what\u2019s going on now seems to be different still. If I think about your own forecast of markets down very low single digit next year, it\u2019s not that bad but it also begs the question why is it only not that bad, if we\u2019ve seen the sequential deterioration. I am trying to draw a little bit on your own experience and then the backdrop of what got us to here. So, it\u2019s really just understand why isn\u2019t next year possibly more like a classical recession that\u2019s down perhaps more analogously to 2001; why things are only holding it down smaller level than might be otherwise the case based on historical precedent? Sandy Cutler : I think, John, it\u2019s the great macro that we\u2019re all trying to understand. I think there are a couple of salient reasons why they\u2019re different. We don\u2019t see significant bubbles having been created out of this very long, low grinding growth rates. The banks are in awfully good shape and a lot of the regulations are ensuring very fulsome capital ratios in that regard. We have not yet seen any form of inflation and the prospect that we could get a couple of quarter point interest rate increases doesn\u2019t feel like the thing that will derail an economic growth at this point. Europe seems to be mending, albeit on a slow basis and a frustratingly slow basis. India is clearly getting better but it\u2019s not big enough to make a difference worldwide. South America is just a washout, let me just take that and put on the side. So, the issue really gets to be how much more a negative impact does China have upon global growth. And that\u2019s a hard one to put our fingers on. I would say in addition if you look at some of the other issues that we think are influencing things is very big currency changes. It clearly affected capacity assessment. If you were a person exporting out of U.S. at the beginning of this year versus now, you\u2019re 18% less competitive. That has caused a lot of people to back up. At some point that capacity appraisal will be made and people decide what they\u2019re going to do. And then the last item which we\u2019ve almost all forgotten about is with natural gas dropped two-three years ago, people speculated on the reindustrialization in United States. We cautioned at that time that that\u2019s going to take five years because designing these plants and building these plants and putting them into production is a five year cycle. Guess what, end of \u201816 and early \u201817 is when a lot of that starts. And so there is a phase of construction going to come here in the country that\u2019s going to be of a very large size and that is traditionally an area where Eaton has participated quite well but it\u2019s not quite yet. So again, we don\u2019t see this very slow grinding recession that doesn\u2019t have a monetary crisis attached to it, we don\u2019t see a reason why that goes dramatically negative. But it is a difficult, frustrating, grinding environment, and that\u2019s why we say again, our strategy has to be built upon on this point. We\u2019re not going to change the markets but we can get our cost down and we can drive superlative cash flow performance that gives us the ability, both to maintain a strong dividend, buy back shares and invest in the business selectively where it makes sense. John Inch : A: Sandy Cutler : We have to watch because we\u2019re in a couple of different lines of this. We\u2019ve got to watch a bunch of different things. But I think the likelihood we\u2019re going to see these commodity businesses change substantially during 2016 is probably pretty low. So you talk about ag and construction and mining et cetera. So, we\u2019ll be watching industrial investment, industrial capacity, MRO spending. I think those are issues that will help inform all of us as to what\u2019s the nature of this going to be. I suspect that residential and light commercial, non-residential constructions will be relatively steady. I think it\u2019s going to be more around this industrial side that is going to be the area to watch. Don Bullock : Unfortunately we have run out of time for our question session today. But we\u2019ll be available to answer questions following up the call today. But I want to thank you all for joining us. We appreciate your time. And as I said, we\u2019ll be able to address your follow-up questions afterwards. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Teleconference service. You may now disconnect.",

Welcome to the Eaton Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode, and later we\u2019ll conduct the question-and-answer session and instructions will be provided at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Vice President of Investor Relations, Don Bullock. Please go ahead. Don Bullock : Good morning. I\u2019m Don Bullock, Eaton\u2019s Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you all for joining us for Eaton\u2019s fourth quarter 2015 earnings call. With me today are Sandy Cutler, Chairman and CEO; Craig Arnold, President and COO; and Rick Fearon, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer. Our agenda today will include opening remarks by Sandy, highlighting the performance in the fourth quarter along with our outlook for the 2016. As we\u2019ve done on our past calls, we\u2019ll take questions at the end of Sandy\u2019s comments. The press release from our earnings announcement this morning and the presentation we\u2019ll go through today have been posted on our website at www.eaton.com. Please note that both the press release and the presentation include reconciliations to non-GAAP measures. In addition a webcast of this call is accessible on our website and will be available for replay. Before we get started, I\u2019d like to remind you that our comments today will include statements related to expected future results of the Company and are therefore forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those forecasted projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and our presentation. They are also outlined in the related 8-K filing. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Sandy. Sandy Cutler : Great, Don. Thanks very much and thank you all for joining this morning. I\u2019m going to work from the presentation that was posted at our investor portal earlier today, and for the sake of brevity, I'll start right on page three, the highlights of fourth quarter results. As you saw we exceeded the guidance we gave for our revenue guidance, we achieved record fourth quarter segment margins. We generated $742 million in operating cash flow and we repurchased $228 million our own shares. We think a very strong quarter in the midst of pretty choppy end markets and I think it concludes the year on strong basis. If you flip to the second chart just a couple of the highlights in terms of the reconciliation to the midpoint of our guidance that we provided for the fourth quarter. You\u2019ll recall the mid-point of our guidance was $1.10. Our volume came in just slightly higher than we had guided to you, recall we had guided organic sales being down 3% from the third quarter, it actually came in at 2%. The net of our restructuring costs and our savings came in about $0.02 better, we got all the savings and more than we were looking for and we actually done at a little bit less costs.  Our tax rate did come in a little bit lower about $0.02, that\u2019s 3.9% versus the roughly 5.5% we had guided to. And then our corporate expenses reflecting that same orientation towards really getting our structural costs down that you saw also manifest itself in our very strong segment performance contributed $0.02. So $0.07 peak [ph] for the quarter, a nice way to finish up the year. If we turn to Page 5, just the overall financial numbers I am sure you had an opportunity to study these. I would just reference one numbers in particular here because it does tie in to a lot to our thinking relative to having increased our restructuring over the next couple of year. The organic growth number which you see in the green box to the lower left of the chart, down some 4%, it was down 3% last year. So, our last quarter, third quarter. So, again if you think through the year last year we actually started up with a first quarter that was slightly up and then the second, third and fourth quarter we've seen our markets weaken. Just a quick run through the individual segments and we\u2019ll get on to the guidance for \u201916, which I think most of you are most interested in trying to get some additional color around. Let start with the electrical product segment that\u2019s on Page 6.  As you can see organic growth was down 1%, it was actually flat in the third quarter. You can see very strong margin performance, 17.7% volume relationship to last year down 5%. And obviously C4X was four point of that. Looking in the bookings, booking were down 1% and it\u2019s interesting if you look around the world, quite different conditions by regions. Americas were flattish, Europe was up nicely, and Asia-Pacific both in this segment as well as in our system and services lateral segment down fairly higher. And we think that reflects the real weakness that\u2019s been going on in China and we'll talk a little bit more about that as we go on in the call. Our net restructuring if you\u2019ll see slight positive to the quarter, a good solid quarter and as you get down within the individual area clearly we\u2019re continuing to see strengthen in our lighting products, our residential continues to be strong in U.S., Canada is weak, Middle East was quite strong which was one of the thing that helped Europe and across Asia Pacific whether it would be in China or whether it would be in some of the electronic products we supply as well, a weaker quarter.  If we flip to Page 7. Electrical System and Services segment. We think a good quarter performance, a nice rebound from the third quarter if you look at the margins, up 13.9%. So one of the stronger quarters we've had this year in that segment. The story is much the same however in terms of the markets. If you look at the box in the lower hand corner again the organic sales down 5%, it was down 5% last quarter as well and the bookings being down 2%. The play out is fairly similar that the real week region was Asia-Pacific once again. As we have talked over the last couple of years we off course see that the bookings over the last couple of quarters are a fairly good predictor of revenue levels in the next several quarters and so if you look back to the third quarter of 2015 our bookings were down some 3%, now they\u2019re down 2% and I think that will help you understand our thinking relative to markets when we talk about that and organic for 2016.  If we move to the next page, page eight our Hydraulics Segment very strong margin performance here as well in spite of a very weak market conditions you may recall that in the third quarter we reported organic sales down 10%, during the fourth quarter they\u2019re down 12%. Our bookings down 22% and that's pretty much a worldwide story. I mean if you go around whether it would be the Americas or Asia-Pacific the numbers are all negative and they\u2019re negative also when we look at both the distributor and the OEM cuts. So these markets continue to be very weak and I think our team has done a really terrific job in terms of really containing cost and driving structural change and that's why you see we think it was stronger than most people expected margins and a segment of 11.2%. If we move to the Chart 9, the Aerospace Segment. Great quarter for Aerospace business as its continuing to having really very-very strong margins. Our bookings were up 6% and we\u2019re particularly pleased in the aftermarket which you know is an area that we've been working hard to continue to bolster. It was up both on the commercial and the military side for an average about 14%. A lot of discussion over the last couple of weeks about what's happening in the commercial aerospace activity, we\u2019ll talk a little bit more about that when we talk about our guidance for next year, but we continue to see that outlook being strong as we move into 2016 and 2017.  And if we move to Chart 10, our Vehicle segment. Really strong quarter performance from a margin perspective again and I know a number of you have had concerns that as this business begins to turn down that it would have a disproportionate impact upon our margins. I think you see here in the fourth quarter our operating plans and the great job our teams have been doing in structural cost out is really having a positive impact not only here on the fourth quarter but once again in our guidance for next year. NAFTA Class 8 shipments in fact were down in the fourth quarter, they were down 6% and -- but you see that the really 18.4%, the margins here in the quarter. As we look into next year we\u2019ll talk a little bit more about it in just a moment, but our forecast is that we\u2019ll see the NAFTA heavy duty market beyond the order of 250,000 units, that's down about 23% from this year. So that is fully incorporated in our planning for next year. If we move to Chart 11, maybe just to kind of cap off 2015. We obviously saw organic growth be negative throughout this year, but in fact that we moved in the second quarter, this is a start to really driven structural cost reduction across the company, is why you\u2019re seeing the real benefits here in the fourth quarter and that obviously sets up a really important part of our operating plans for 2016. Segment margins were 15.2%, free cash flows slightly below our target of 100%. As we look at this year, we did repurchase a 2.4% of our shares outstanding that's about $682 million we spend on that during this year. We paid down $1 billion of debt this year and we have completed the Cooper integration and so really as we enter into this next year you\u2019ll see we virtually have no acquisition integration costs anticipated during 2016 as well. 2012 really -- just for your records really gives you the kind of breakout on how are restructuring plan laid out during 2015 and as I mentioned upfront our net benefits in the fourth quarter were better than we had laid out for you earlier and I think reflect the momentum we have with an overall restructuring program. Page 13, titled 2015 Restructuring Cost and Benefit, really gave you a view of that full year activity more for your historical background as you think of our performance across the segments. Now jump to Chart 14, as we start to talk about our thoughts about 2016. With the weaker markets that we had anticipated in October you may recall those number, I'll go back over them for you in a just a moment on a subsequent chart, we've now accelerated and in fact expanded our restructuring actions and as our view that a couple of you had commented on your write-ups this morning that 2016 and 2017 will remain somewhat challenged time periods in terms of end market growth and so our focus is getting the cost out and using our balance sheet to buy back shares and to really get the company in well positioned in what will be a period of lower growth then we had seen in previous years. So what you see in that chart up top, we\u2019ve tried to lay out for your ease, here is our 2015 actuals, than our 2016 and 2017 costs and then the incremental benefits that occur in each year, it's incremental to the previous year and you can see the total. The big news here is that we\u2019ve expanded the program to a three year program, we\u2019re going to spend about $400 million, we\u2019ll get benefits of just over $400 million over this time period. And as you think about 2016 because I know that\u2019s of real interest to you, we\u2019ll spend about $70 million of that $140 million in the first quarter of this year. Above 50% of the balanced, so of the balance of the $70 million will be spend in the second quarter and then during the third quarter and fourth quarter the spending is fairly equal. The benefits however, not much of those incremental benefits of 185 occur in the first quarter because we\u2019re just kicking off this second phase of actions and it builds through the balance of the year. So it is a reasonable expectation that it has a bigger contribution to operating earnings per share in the third quarter and fourth quarter than it would have in the second quarter. Let's jump to Chart 15. And I mentioned before our view of our markets and organic growth opportunities are lower than they were when we last discussed this with you in October. You recall that we haven\u2019t laid out a formal forecast, but we had shared with you some early thoughts on 2016 in our October earnings conference call and at that time we talked about organic revenues being down on the order of 1% to 2%. We now, with the benefit of the last several months and I think all weaker and after [ph] news, it\u2019s not only we but you also have been reading as well our detailed discussions with our customers around the world. We think a better expectation tuned up for that doubt is that our organic revenues would decline on the order of 2% to 4%.  As you go through these individuals segments let me just give you a sense for what has changed. As you can see the rate on the chart our organic revenue growth projections for the individual five segments we report. For Electrical Products, we think the organic growth will be in the range of 0% to 2%. In Electrical Systems and Services, a negative 2% to negative 4%. In October we had said if you put those two together we thought the growth would be about 1%. In the Hydraulics areas we are now forecasting organic growth of negative 9% to negative 11%, in October we had said we thought it would be about negative 7%. In Aerospace we're saying 1% to 3% not that much as change, we thought it would be 3%. And in Vehicle we had thought it would be negative 5% in October, we now think it will be 7% to 9%. So what are the big drivers here, let me start from a bottom where I ended with Vehicle. We now think the North American heavy duty market will decline to about 250,000 units that's the whole market for NAFTA down 23% from where we finished up just over 320,000 units in 2015. We think light vehicle markets in the U.S. are going to remain strong kind of flat to 1% up, we think China will continue to move along fairly well in terms of its light vehicle markets. We think Europe, we\u2019re in agreement with most of the consensus that\u2019s out there that its probably up on the order of something like 2% and we continue to feel that Latin America is a very troubled area and really when we talk about the vehicle market, we\u2019re talking really about Brazil and so those numbers will be down 10% to 15% this year. That\u2019s what brings us to our 7% and 9%.  Within the hydraulics market I would say really a continuation of the negative expectations in terms of the world wide Ag equipment market and the construction equipment market and not much positive on the industrial side. Then I would say again 9% to 11% is our best approximation having talked to our customers and you've seen many of them release their own guidance for 2016. We think this is very much in line with our own projections.  If you move to Chart 16. Titled Segment Operating Margin Expectations, I think it's really noteworthy that in the fourth quarter we increased our operating margins in spite of negative organic growth and that is indeed exactly our plan again in 2016. In spite of about $1 billion volume decline and again that's about 600 million in organic growth and about 400 million from Forex, we expect to expand our segment margins. They finished at 15.2% last year and as you can see the midpoint of our guidance is 15.6%, so about 40 basis points expansion. We can obviously talk about each of these as we field your questions, but I would call your attention to Vehicle because I know many of you are concerned in terms of looking at the year of 2016 is that we would see a several hundred point contraction in vehicle margins as the overall market place began to decline and as you can see we\u2019re confident with our operating plan and the benefit of all the restructuring we\u2019re doing and the fine jobs been done by our team there that we\u2019re going to hold very attractive margins in that segment. And I think it\u2019s really a key element in terms of thinking about the evaluation of [indiscernible] because this is one that you\u2019ve been concerned about historically from a volatility point of view. If we turn to Chart 17, labeled our Multiyear Share Purchase Program. You\u2019ll recall in July we laid out our new capital plan which outlined on an annual basis repurchasing 1% to 2% of our outstanding shares per year. We paid of this last year as I mentioned about $1 billion of debt and we repurchased $682 million or about 2.4% of our outstanding shares and we have commented through the fall that in this period of time where we're seeing such weakness in equity pricing and specifically on our own that we were tilting our balanced plan that we had of spending about 50% on the share repurchase and about 50% on acquisitions that we were tilting it towards buying back more of our shares. And what we\u2019re announcing today obviously is that we\u2019re targeting a $3 billion share repurchase program and those are for the years 2015 through 2018 and so what that means was also having purchased back obviously 682 million last year this is about $2.3 billion of purchases over these next three years about 10% of our outstanding share. That does move us a little closer to sort of an annual buyback that on the order of more like 2.5% versus 1.5%.  Specifically in terms of 2016 and you\u2019ll recall that I just mentioned the numbers in 2015, we bought back 682 million, we would expect the buyback about that same levels this year, roughly $700 million. It will as it normally is for us be backend loaded in terms of how are cash flow lays out through the year. But it does play an important part in terms of how we offset a slightly higher tax rate and I'll talk about that in just a moment. You\u2019ll recall at yearend's 2015 our share count was 460.4 million shares and so we\u2019ll leave at you to kind of figure out backend loaded buying back about whether to pull out full shares, but we think its worth around about $0.09 of positive impact. So if you move to Chart 18 to kind of pull this all together in terms of our EPS guidance for 2016, let's start with the first quarter. Our operating and fully diluted EPS this year is the same because we don\u2019t have acquisition integration across this year. We think our organic revenue compared to the fourth quarter so the actual numbers we just reported will come down about 5%, for those of you who are already calculating that means it\u2019s down about 8% from last year in the first quarter. The tax rate will be between 8% to 10% and the segment margin including the restructuring cost of the $70 million will be somewhere between 13.5% and 14%. That's what supports our $0.80 to $0.90 operating and fully diluted guidance for the first quarter.  In terms of the full year again no acquisition to raise [ph] cost so the $4.15 to $4.45 with the midpoint of obviously $4.30. The guidance does include the full net restructuring benefit that we outlined for you that\u2019s on the previous charts of $174 million that's a year-to-year benefit from our restructuring. And the $45 million from the Cooper integration savings which is primarily the full year benefit of the plant closings that we were concluding in the back half of last year.  So the operating EPS and I think this is really the best way to think about our operating plan. We\u2019ll have flat operating EPS year-to-year, will actually be up 2% in terms of fully diluted. So we don\u2019t have acquisition integration charges. But that flat operating EPS year-to-year really incorporates having revenues down $1 billion, $600 million of organic, $400 million of FX, margin\u2019s up 40 basis points, driven by all the restructuring work that we got a good head start on by starting early in 2015 and then the share repurchases of approximately 700 million are basically going to offset the impact of what we anticipate is going to be an increase in the tax rate from roughly 8% last year to roughly 10% as the midpoint of our range this year. So if you turn to Page 19. Just to recap again organic revenue down 2% to 4%. You\u2019ll recall we had a couple of very small acquisitions so we had a little positive in terms of $35 million in terms of additional revenue. 2% negative Forex, that\u2019s that $400 million top line impact that I mentioned negative. Operating margins with the 40 basis points expansion from last year. Corporate expenses continuing to reflect all of the work that we're doing to get our cost down not only in our operating units but across the corporation as well. Tax rate ticking up slightly from last year, I just mentioned the flat operating EPS and the 2% increase in net income per share. Operating cash flow 2.6 billion to 2.8 billion, free cash flow of 2.1 billion to 2.3 billion, obviously that looks like it's been as a cash conversion ratio of greater than 1 and yes that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re targeting.  Then CapEx of about 525 million, I can understand some of you may have a question, gee that's pretty similar to what you spent last year, if your volumes are coming down, why are you spending as much CapEx? We do have some capital that is involved in all of this restructuring actions and that's really the difference to facilitate getting them done in areas where we may be closing and consolidating facilities. So that\u2019s our outlook for 2016 and we think it's a tight plan. We obviously have had the benefit of looking very hard at these markets and we\u2019re really confident about the restructuring plan that we put together. And so that restructuring plan and our share buyback, very much in our own control and those are the kind of variables we\u2019re trying to control as we move into it into 2016. Don with that I\u2019ll turn things back to you for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Don Bullock : Before we begin the Q&A session today, I do notice that we have a significant number of questions in the queue. So given our time constrain today of an hour for the call, and the desire to get to as many of these questions that you have as possible, I\u2019d ask that you limit your questions to a single question and a follow up. I appreciate your cooperate in advance. With that we\u2019ll open the questions with Scott Davis from Barclays. Scott Davis : Sandy you only have I think four months left or so of your tenure and you\u2019ve seen a bunch of cycles and I\u2019d love to get your opinion on how does the world get better? I mean how do we -- back here, your bookings are getting less negative for sure, but how do we get back to positive growth, what\u2019s it going to take in your opinion at least from a world perspective to have a recovery insight? Sandy Cutler : That\u2019s probably almost a [indiscernible] question. But I think clearly we\u2019ve got a couple of big issues going on and we\u2019re in a commodity cycle and it doesn\u2019t matter whether it be oil and gas, whether it be metals, whether it\u2019d be Ag, we\u2019ve seen as the world has slowed down it's not having a fairly profound effect on a lot of these commodities. This too will bottom we\u2019ve been -- lived through a bunch of these. It just our view that we\u2019re not going to see that end in \u201916, that\u2019s why we said that it's so important really to get -- to take these restructuring actions in \u201915 and \u201916. Hard to forecast right now, Scott, whether that turn up is in \u201917 or whether that turn up is in \u201918, I think most forecasts have always proved to be wrong, but I think that the benefit of where we are right now, we\u2019re in the second year of this fairly deep commodity cycle. And as we pointed out in our earnings release, this is really only the second time that we have seen our end markets be negative in consecutive years and we got to go all the way back to the 2000-2001 time period; people were pretty mopey then and by 2002-2003 we popped back out of that. And so I think you will see this cycle come back out. Scott Davis : And then Vehicle, I\u2019m one of the guys who\u2019ve been skeptical in margins and you\u2019ve proven us wrong here. Help us just understand, is this all a function of restructuring? Is there other benefits here, whether it\u2019d LIFO accounting or mix or something else? Sandy Cutler : No change in accounting. This is just plain old hard way of running a business really well, and the teams have really been working hard on restructuring and making sure that new products we introduce have attractive value propositions and just I\u2019d say it's doing it the hard way. Scott Davis : So, some of it is new products that are not [multiple speakers]. Sandy Cutler : But remember in the automotive business you tend to -- we have pretty good automotive and truck business. We have pretty good visibility forward wise in terms of what we win. So, I think we\u2019ve had another very good year of bookings in 2015 really on a global basis. And so we feel comfortable both on that revenue side of how we\u2019re doing with our customers. But I feel really good about the work that\u2019s been done in the business on all of the cost work. Don Bullock : Our next question comes from Ann Duignan with JP Morgan. Ann Duignan : Good morning and thanks for the color on the Vehicle side and Hydraulics side. Sandy could you give us similar color regarding your subsectors in Electrical Products and Electrical Systems? What you\u2019re seeing in the different end markets? Sandy Cutler : I think our comments probably aren\u2019t going to sound vastly different from many of our peers who have announced, we\u2019re looking at the residential market in the U.S. as being one that will continue to be a positive on the order of say 3% to 4% next year, non-res is probably the hardest one of all of those numbers to figure out particularly here in the U.S. there are so many different opinions on non-res we think much of what\u2019s been published is perhaps a little too bullish. We\u2019re more in the 3% to 5%. I know there is some people that are at 8%, gosh I hope they\u2019re right, but that\u2019s not what we\u2019re basing our expectations on. Utilities is a little better than we\u2019ve seen it the last couple of years, but it's still a 0% to 2%. Industrial is quite troubled still in terms of just not seeing a lot going through that, so that\u2019s probably a 0% to a negative number. As you get into harsh and hazardous applications that have large portions of oil and gas around them, those are numbers that are like negative 15 type number. And then when we look in the large power quality areas, I\u2019d say those markets are likely to be slightly negative again this next year. Last comment I would say is that we just don\u2019t see the big large industrial construction numbers that are being so quantitatively [ph] reported in many of the government\u2019s statistics. We\u2019re out there bidding on them all and we aren\u2019t seeing what they\u2019re talking about. So that\u2019s our view as to how we look. We don\u2019t see Asia Pacific getting substantially stronger, we think still that\u2019s going to be weakened up by the lack of the big projects there. EMEA is coming back and I mentioned in the fourth quarter we saw pretty good tone there and again we\u2019re at a very low single-digit but it's better than a negative. Ann Duignan : Thanks for the color Sandy. And just a quick follow up, you had mentioned previously that on the manufacturing side in the U.S. the downstream built up from oil and gas. But maybe you start to see orders in that business pickup towards the back assets this year for deliver in '17, is that still your expectations? Sandy Cutler : The big natural gas and exploring terminals that we are committed [technical difficulty] to us like those are going ahead here in the second half, that\u2019s still our expectations. You are starting to see some of the big integrator are really clashing capital budgets again and that\u2019s why our view has been that you have a second year of a negative in the oil and gas industry broadly in this year. And once you start these big cycles it takes a couple of years for them to swing back. Ann Duignan : Okay. Thank you, I leave it there and get back into queue. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Steve Winoker with Bernstein. Steve Winoker : Maybe a little bit more on the margin front. So, given the ambitious margin expansion you've got set up for next year, the way I use to think about it with you was decrementals I think 20 to 30 normally, plus you got pricing here soon productivity kind of costs inflation. Could you give us -- or deflation -- give us a sense for some of the pieces of this, obviously with restructuring being the baggiest positive, but just help us work through how you\u2019re getting there? Sandy Cutler : I think Steve the way is, as we have watched volumes come down as strongly as they have all the way through '15 and then '16. Those incrementals or decrementals are getting bigger because you\u2019re getting down to points where you really have big knee curves. And so our own thinking is it\u2019s probably a 35% at this point so that\u2019s how we sort look at the decrementals. It hasn\u2019t changed degree to yield for us in terms of Forex but those are more like 10% to 11% types numbers. And then the rest basically comes from the cost reductions that we\u2019re getting. And remember to add in the $45 million of the acquisition integration benefits into the two electrical segments. Steve Winoker : Okay. And then the other pieces like pricing, what that in there? Sandy Cutler : It's fairly neutrally, I would say our expectations is that we do expect some tailwinds this year and that\u2019s really because commodity prices have come off as hard as they have in the fourth quarter and January sure look that way all the numbers we can see, commodity didn\u2019t do much recovery in the month of January. So, I\u2019d say a slight tailwind from commodity on margins this year as well. Steve Winoker : And just a follow up. That restructuring for the fourth quarter, I guess you did $2 million of costs and you saved about $10 million more versus planned. Was that all timing in those two line items on Page 12? Sandy Cutler : No, I would say that the big issue is that we were able to complete that restructuring at a lower cost than we had thought it was going to take, it\u2019s wasn\u2019t that we pushed something out, it wasn't that we didn\u2019t take some action, it\u2019s just sort of the actual cost turned out to be less than we had thought it was going to originally take. Steve Winoker : Okay, okay thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse. Julian Mitchell : Just starting with Electrical Products. You are guiding for a reasonable margin development in 2016, but looking at the moving parts lighting probably outgrows the rest that\u2019s a mix drag, it often has been, could be very difficult. So, why do you -- is there something in the mix or is it purely restructuring that you think can give you that margin uplift in Electrical Product? Sandy Cutler : Our [indiscernible] numbers is in Electrical Systems and Services. But I would say it's the restructuring and it\u2019s the benefits from the Cooper. So, remember those first two segments Electrical Product, Electoral S&S that have both the restructuring savings and then you'll have about $45 million to put between the two and it's likely to be pretty equal between the two this year the $45 million. Julian Mitchell : Understood. And then my follow up would be on Vehicle, not so much the margins but just the top-line. So, in Q4 you had a 6% organic decline, NAFTA Class 8 shipments were also down six. For 2016 you are saying that NAFTA Class 8 down over 20, but your organic sales guide for the year is only down high single-digit for vehicle. So, I guess what's changing in 2016 versus Q4 leaving aside Class 8? Sandy Cutler : You get a little bit a seasonal here too as well. And remember in the fourth quarter you have a bit of what I will call second half December shutdowns that occurred. So, that\u2019s a piece of it, remember that North American part of that fall of actually occurred in the fourth quarter to. So, of the 23 we talked about reduction you had a 6 points fall off from a year ago occur in the fourth quarter and we\u2019re talking about full year 23. But I think it's more seasonal and Craig any other color on that? Craig Arnold : Obviously, you just need the metrics [ph] to tell, the 6 was the Delta from Q3. If you actually take look at North America classic truck, year-over-year it was down much more in line with what the forecast in 2016 and the North America Class 8 truck number is obviously an important number for the vehicle business but as Sandy went through that point one of the many segments that make up our vehicle business. And we continue to see around the world pretty robust numbers in growth in our automotive markets around the world, and so just one piece of the equation. And then the other piece as we start to anniversary some of the really weak numbers that we\u2019ve seen in South America which is the biggest piece of our Vehicle business or Company's exposure in South America and Brazil, those comparatives just get much easier. Don Bullock : Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Evelyn Chan : Good morning. This is actually Evelyn Chan for Joe. Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to touch on capital allocation and the 3 billion share buyback program, not to put words in your mouth, but I think the view on the priority of investment has been first to address weaker marketing that cost out and as than if you get our to 2017 maybe there are other alternative to running your business or portfolio that are available to you. So I guess what's the impedes to commit so much of your cash now towards buyback for the next few years? Sandy Cutler : And again it's not all of our capital, it's -- we\u2019re tilting it towards that and our view is that this time of relatively weak equity performance and weak market prospects is a time when we can take advantage of really buying back shares and creating value for our customers at a time when I think certainty is something that everyone is looking for and so that's our view in terms of tilting over this point. Evelyn Chan : That makes sense Sandy. And then I guess maybe switching gears it looks like bookings trends are moving in the right direction and we've heard a lot of surprisingly positive commentary from the industrial peers on short cycle trends in January. Can you address what you\u2019re seeing in your business here at the start of the year and what you maybe see in your front-log to drive back 8% year-over-year decline in 1Q? Sandy Cutler : Our view is that there are couple of distributors that have come out and talked about things being a little bit more positive. Actually our direct business peers, I don\u2019t think you've heard as much commentary coming out about the first quarter. I don\u2019t think we're seeing anything at this point that causes us to think that markets are better than what we\u2019re forecasting here. This is a -- we've seen markets coming off each quarter throughout 2015 typically our first quarter is seasonally weaker than our fourth quarter, it's our weakest quarter of the year and that's how we've laid out our guidance for this year. So I think it's a little early to call the year. Fortunately, we haven\u2019t had a major snow event this year which hasn\u2019t given us a big hit in January, but I\u2019d say no were not seeing anything different than our guidance at this point. Evelyn Chan : Okay, thanks very much. Don Bullock : Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Jeff Sprague : Thank you. Good morning everyone. I wonder Sandy if you can come back around to price. So I think it was an earlier question on price and I think you answered it more around kind of cost relief, but when you were saying you see a tailwind there, where you kind of commenting that price cost net is the tailwind? Can you just price [ph] that together for us and provide a little bit of color actually on the pricing side. Sandy Cutler : Yes. I would say yes the price cost net, a slight tailwind. And [indiscernible] conditions are very different in every one of our market segments some have long-term contracts, some have price adjusters and then they\u2019re based in contracts, were not seeing the environment being one where there I would say there is undo price competition. Obviously markets are down, things are tough and if we see the market is behaving pretty well. Jeff Sprague : And then on the comment about the corporate expenses down maybe towards the $80 million decline is that all in across corporate options and pension and everything or is that actually just the corporate expense line? Sandy Cutler : Yes. So that's interest amortization, pension and corporate cost, so that whole complex of cost. Jeff Sprague : Great, thank you. Don Bullock : Our next question comes from John Inch with Deutsche Bank. John Inch : Look I realize this is not a direct comp, but it is the big industrial, Emersion more or less suggested that we were approaching a bottom with respect to its various markets and they expect orders to actually turn positive after March. Sandy, it's kind of ductailing on Scott's point, I mean do you think we are approaching a bottom, it doesn\u2019t suggest there is recovery coming anytime soon. But do you think we\u2019re approaching an overall bottom and then what are you thinking about your own orders, are we looking at a positive inflection at some point this year? Sandy Cutler : Perhaps it's the best indication, we've talked about this point a lot John and our own planning is as we put the plans together this fall were not counting on an economic rebound in the second half. We think that's been kind of an unwise premise to go into these markets where if it does gets stronger, so much the better, we can scramble up, we've done that well in the past, but the restructuring actions that we\u2019re taking, this commitment to a three year restructuring plan says that we think 2016 doesn\u2019t recover when we get to the second half. John Inch : First I wanted to echo some of the other comments so I think your margin performance in the pace of while which is actually pretty commendable. The one business that does take out is Hydraulics right, it does appear whether it's because of Asia or pricing or whatever it appears to be getting worst and it appears margin, but I mean your margins are down despite the heavy emphasis of restructuring your margins is still down a point year-over-year. So what I'd be interested in is really your thought process about and maybe Craig\u2019s even, add to this. Hydraulic strategically I mean I guess if we have had this perspective that's the world was going to be this difficult we may not have built this businesses, there is some of the M&A we get kind of more recently, but instead you\u2019ve made the comment that you can\u2019t really adjust your portfolio in terms of spins until what 2017 because of Cooper. But you can always still do something with the business on a sale basis or something else. How should we be thinking about Hydraulics? Because it really is sticking out negatively, unfortunately versus the other segments at this juncture. Sandy Cutler : Let me come back to couple of the elements that you mentioned. You are right is that we are not able to do tax free spins until after the five year anniversary. We have indicated that we do have the strategic flexibility that if we decide to we can sell businesses on a taxable basis just as we did the two aerospace businesses that Craig led last year that we felt we could better step out of because they weren\u2019t strategically managed. There is no question on hydraulics. We\u2019re dealing with a very difficult end market. We commented on that last year, we don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to change this year. We actually think the margin performance is pretty commendable in light of where the volumes have been, but we understand it's not at the mid-teen levels right now that we would like to see it at. We do think with the actions that the team is undertaking and if we get into the later part of this year, you\u2019re going to see some far more attractive margins than you will see in the early part of this year because we\u2019re taking some very-very significant steps within that business. We\u2019re trying to get this business sized so that you can perform well without having to have a market rebound because again we think we are in a commodity cycle and clearly we don\u2019t have the benefit of the revenues that we had number of years ago, when it was the high point. And Craig do you want to add anything to that? Craig Arnold : No, the only thing I would add to what you said is we really are living through what I would argue is a really unprecedented period in the Hydraulic markets and you can\u2019t find the hydraulic end market today that hasn\u2019t gone through a pretty perceptive downturn, whether it's Ag or it's China construction, or its mining the oil and gas. Most recently anything tied to capital purchases and on the industrial side the business. And so when we take a look at the end markets that we serve inside our Hydraulics periods, but for the great recession over the last 15 years we\u2019ve never seen a period like this in Hydraulics business and to say this point they have a business that in this environment that can still stand up clearly margins got on it the Company average, but margins that are 10% to 11% we think is pretty remarkable performance from that business. And at some point these markets will turn and whether or not that end of \u201916, \u201917 but to Sandy\u2019s point we\u2019re putting together a plan today that says we\u2019re going to make sure that this business deliveries attract the margins at this level of economic activity and when it turns it will throw up very handsome new commendable profits. And so today clearly we\u2019re living in a period in the hydraulics space that we don\u2019t like it any more than you do, we\u2019re doing what we think we need to do, but we think this will be a very attractive business when markets turn and they will turn. John Inch : And Craig would it also be fair to say, I mean Sandy intimated you, we\u2019re still dealing with a little bit of M&A even though you\u2019ve stepped up share repurchase. Rather than just ride out Hydraulics and the cyclicality, would it be fair to say you might want to make up for some of those other deals in terms of the timing and do some acquisitions in this space? Is that on the table still? Sandy Cutler : So what we said really is, until we get a real sense for where markets are going to bottom out, it\u2019s really difficult at this point in the cycle to really value Hydraulic assets. And so to your point, we made a couple of acquisitions in this space a number of years ago and quite frankly we and the whole world got markets wrong. And so I would say as we think about hydraulics today in M&A it really is a piece that\u2019s off the table until we get a sense for where markets are and nothing bottomed out and we can really then predict the future. Don Bullock : Our next question comes from [indiscernible] with Longbow. Unidentified Analyst : Just following that up everybody picks on the toughest segment in the bottom and with every turn people say who benefits and you have good sector to benefit. But when we talk about hydraulics in front of the rest of the Company, can we talk about where inventories are, what did you see during the quarter as far as inventory liquidation and most of it\u2019s over or are we close to doing it? And where do you think inventories are as you go through this year for you guys into channels and particularly with lower volume maintenance [ph], so we\u2019re probably coming down some more? Sandy Cutler : Our best sense and talk about the two segments where there are distributor inventories, I think that to answer your question is on the electrical side people have been seeing markets be tighter than they were a number of years ago. And so we actually think there hasn\u2019t been substantial change in inventory. They\u2019ve been low. We don\u2019t think we\u2019re either suffering from liquidation or there is a lot more liquidation to go on. On the hydraulic side, clearly the point Craig just made, our distributors have been dealing with this for prolonged period of time. I think the one segment where you find when you travel regionally and you talk to different customers, if an individual distributor whether they were electrical or whether they were hydraulic had an unusually high exposure to oil and gas area. They may still be struggling with some inventories because I think that has continued to move in a way that many people didn\u2019t predict it would. But I\u2019d say outside of that, I think they\u2019re fairly balanced. I think people have got their hatches buttoned down tight and they too are trying to live through a period of time when growth is less than they\u2019d hoped it might be a couple of years ago. Unidentified Analyst : So, we're looking at production, it will effectively end market demand? [Multiple speakers]. Sandy Cutler : Pretty similar. I think the major OEMs are very much that way too, they've been at this for some time as well. So, with the exception of what I\u2019d call you'll find in some OEMs the big issue isn't the inventory, it's that the equipment they have shift is being utilized at a very low level. So there the utilization rates has to come up before their demand, before new equipment comes up. But I think it's less of an inventory issue today and that was just very low levels of utilization. Unidentified Analyst : And just a follow up, I mean we talked going up a little bit with Emerson's said yesterday in their numbers. But the one market that they pointed to was that datacenter market had bottomed and they talked about improving datacenter markets, I don\u2019t know if you are seeing that\u2019s or has that just happened, is probably better than what you are anticipating. Are you seeing any movements in the datacenter sector here or in Asia or so or is that still a hope that\u2019s happening rather than [indiscernible]? Sandy Cutler : And we had action last fall and it\u2019s continued for us, that they were -- during a first half kind a disappointing year in terms of significant bookings. We saw really good activity and good wins in the second half of the last year that is going to help us with our shipments this year. And we've been very pleased with the fact that I think I've mentioned on several occasions that we came out with the new high-end three phase UPS which had an even higher energy saving component which was really sized for the web point, a 2.0 type of datacenter. So, it is allowing us to compete very advantageously there. Unidentified Analyst : You have forecasted improving datacenter markets as we go through this year as part of the Electrical forecast of this month? Sandy Cutler : Yeah. And I will say the overall PC market is not that great but some of that top end stuff is getting better. Operator : Our next question comes from Joshua Pokrzywinski with Buckingham. Joshua Pokrzywinski : So, just on the follow-up to kind of some of these comments on when we bottom and when comps will be easier. I guess maybe this is still down a little bit Sandy, do you think we exit 2016 just given the comp influence of maybe a little bit of destocking obviously not that much based on your last comment on easier comp. Do we start to see a business like hydraulics inflect positive by the fourth quarter? Sandy Cutler : We are not forecasting it at this point, it's just we would love to be able to answer to the question, believe us for our own utilization as well but we just -- we think we're better the plan on the fact that we aren't going to see the rebound at that point. And if we do it will be an upside, there is so much time between now and the fourth quarter in terms of seeing what happens to crop prices, what happens to commodity prices and we've seen the volatility in these areas. So, we are not able to forecast that so, we are not assuming it's going to occur. Joshua Pokrzywinski : Got you. And then maybe from the margin perspective on the other side of that. As restructuring yields out, I mean by the time we get to the fourth quarter you should be running well above that 10% just given the timing now and maybe any help you can give on that? Sandy Cutler : Yeah. Very definitely, and again as we go back to the comments I made about the restructuring if you recall that of the $140 million of restructuring costs that we\u2019re going to incur during 2016, $70 million is in the first quarter, roughly $35 million in the second quarter, then the balance in last two. So that just itself helps margins. Now, you put the savings which their whole incremental savings occurs over the quarters of two, three and four and it gets bigger as three and four go on. So, yes each of the margins should deal and very distinctly in Hydraulics, back to Craig's position you will start to see how this plan manifests itself. I think the real big takeaway from yours and many other people's question is that we are not counting on an economic rebound to drive our plan nor our earnings. What we are counting on is the things that we can control and that\u2019s the very important change that we made at the second quarter of last year when we announced that we were going to drive very significant restructuring and that we've now added another year to that, but then we've also announced an enlarged buyback. Those are two things we can control and we think in this environment where there is so much that people are so uncertain about, we are putting the premium on, let's deliver certainty where we can. Operator : Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Nigel Coe : Thanks good morning and kudos on the cost control. Couple of things just wanted to go back for restructuring and I am just wondering does the nature of the restructuring change over the next couple of years and I am just wondering if we move from headcount to more facility based restructuring. And within that maybe just to make a comment on the CapEx, although the CapEx\u2019s comments around restructuring was interesting. I am wondering are we seeing some capital perfect use of labor here or just primarily consolidating small some of these into larger ones? Craig Arnold : Hi Nigel, this is Craig Arnold. Maybe I'll take that one for you. The way we think about kind of this whole roadmap to reducing our cost is, we really think about it in three buckets. These was a big buckets around facilities. Our manufacturing footprint around the world and distribution centers and offices, and we have a pretty healthy appetite and the backlog of opportunities to continue to right size our facility footprints. So that\u2019s one big bucket of activity that is undergoing today and we think that continues for the next several years or so. There is another bucket that really gets to what we call support costs, a numbers of management layers that we have and the span of control of our leaders, the size of our corporate infrastructure and that\u2019s a whole another element of activities that has done a lot to improve it in 2015 and we think that also plays out continually in 2016 and perhaps a little bit in 2017 as well. And then there is the third bucket that I\u2019m put the category of really optimizing where you do, what should do and actually moving more of our activities to low cost centers and as we\u2019re opening up shared servicing [ph] in low cost countries and putting various activities that we do today that simply putting them in places and where we can do it to a much lower cost and in many case more efficiently. And those are really the three bucket of activities that we\u2019re undertaking across the company and we think it continuous being part of our go forward plans. Nigel Coe : Okay. That's good color. And then secondly I appreciate the color on the cash deployment over the next three years. On the free cash conversion roughly $0.107 [ph] for next year what gives you confidence that that you can get the work to capital other system as your sales are declining 4% or so? Craig Arnold : I'll take that Nigel. They are really two big elements to the improvement in free cash flow from 2015 to 2016. First of all we are not going to make a U.S. pension contribution and so that's is an improvement of about a $160 million and then secondly with sales going down generally classic working capital is about 18% of sales so as the 420 million or so of organic sales decline gets around $80 million and then we do have inventories that we have built up as part of Cooper that come out and frankly we ended the year with a little bit more inventories than we had hoped simply because of the speed of which sales had come down and so all of that leads us to say the expectation of a 160 million from lower pension contribution and another roughly a 140 million of working capital liquidation, that's how you get from this 1.9 to 2.2 midpoint of free cash flow. Don Bullock : Our question comes from Andy Casey with Wells Fargo. Andrew Casey : Sandy I'm wondering within the nonresidential commentary that you gave little bit earlier whether you've seen any of the weakness being seen in some of your industrial end markets in the U.S. starting to impact any of the really nonmanufacturing sectors of nonresidential construction. Sandy Cutler : Let me take oil and gas kind of offset the table but if you speak to the other nonmanufacturing we obviously had a very good quarter, fourth quarter in terms of quotations. When we look at all quotations and negotiations we\u2019re involved in the stronger part of the commercial market from our perspective and we've got a very big window looking at, I'm speaking to the U.S. here has been the smaller project so it's been project that you could say or it kind of start off the residential base and they get up into kind of medium size projects is the really big ones that are intended to be a little bit less strong in the marketplace now you are seeing a number of big stadiums build around the U.S. that really started in the second quarter of last year and that's going to continue through this year. What I'd say the weakness we've seen in kind of construction in the U.S. has been very big power using construction where a lot of medium vaults are just used and that tends to be industrial or very big-big commercial and the strength has been more towards the smaller projects. Andrew Casey : Thanks. And then I think kind of going back to some of the other questions but taking a different view point on it, if we look back at prior cycles you see some of the things that are weakening fairly significantly off of peak conditions, like truck. What sort of probability would you put on the U.S. instead of staying in this stagnate and just starting to go into recession, not this year but maybe next year? Sandy Cutler : We don\u2019t see that as the high probability, We do think that we are in this frustratingly slow environment that can often cause people to use the recession word, but I think that's almost a more of a kind of an emotional issues than it is a the factual basis, we think that GDP is likely to grow in the mid-two's again this year. However as we are on the industrial side of the economy were seeing industrial production numbers that are more like 1. So all that we\u2019ve been and I'm just repeating what we probably all read is that there has been more action on the kind of the consumer and services side then there has been on the industrial side and that's what's been leading to the lack of capital investment for this MRO industrial malaise and that is clearly been affecting ours and many of our peers market. So I think I would say that's more of the tone and you compare the U.S. growth to around the world it's not significantly different in the total global GDP so there are countries slower and faster, but that's how we see it. We just think this is it is the time when it's really critical that companies get their cost base adjusted that they don\u2019t assume that economic growth is going to bail them out hence they control those things that they can control and that\u2019s exactly what our plan\u2019s all about, but it's not based on and nor do we think it's the high probability that there is a recession. Don Bullock : Next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC. Deane Dray : Thank you. I had a question on the Aerospace number of the booking up 14%. How does that split between commercial and military, and how much of that will flow into 2016? Sandy Cutler : The commercial side, Deane, continues to be the stronger side. If we look at the three elements of booking within Aerospace, we were seeing commercial be up on the order of roughly 7, military was down on the order of about 6, and then aftermarket was up the 14. That\u2019s not a bad way to think about how things work going forward. As we think about a market we\u2019re seeing will be up too next year, you\u2019d assume the commercials is going to be a slight premium to that market and the military is going to be a slight discount to it. And we would hope that the aftermarket that we could grow a little faster in the average, it won\u2019t be like the 14% or 15% number, but it\u2019d be slightly above our average number. Deane Dray : And then for Rick the tax rate for 2016 seeing a lift from 8% to 10%. Maybe just comment on what\u2019s going on there? And is there any update on what might be the natural rate that Eaton would level out to? Rick Fearon : Our rate as you point was 8% for \u201915, the midpoint of our guidance of 10% for \u201916. And really that\u2019s the function of more U.S. income it's the function of the restructuring actions a lot of which do increase U.S. income. As well as the fact that the U.S. is -- some parts of our U.S. business that are still growing pretty healthily certainly relative to some other parts of the world. If you look longer term, I continue to believe that the rates will be somewhere between 10% and 15%, it\u2019ll probably slowly tick up. But I would emphasize slowly not like more than 1 or 2 percentage point moves in a given year. Don Bullock : Our next question comes from Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc. Jeff Hammond : Just have a quick follow up here in corporate expense. Can you split out of that $80 million, how much is restructuring savings that we should put in the restructuring bucket and how much is something else like lower pension? Sandy Cutler : I think there is very little that\u2019s restructuring at this point. And so I would regard that as principally the core corporate cost Jeff. Jeff Hammond : So, we can figure that as a separate bucket from the incremental restructuring savings? Sandy Cutler : No, it's all built into the total number that we gave you. But I guess what I am just indicating is that the amount of actual corporate cost for restructuring in \u201916 are very-very tiny part of that $140 million, it's single-digit million. Jeff Hammond : How much is pension going to be down year-on-year? Sandy Cutler : There is going to be a substantial improvement in pension or reduction in pension costs. And it's a number that will be -- for two reasons it will be a number that is down on the order of north of $50 million and the biggest part of that is going to be that we did move to the split rate pension that so many of our peers have moved to, we think it's better accounting. And so that\u2019s the biggest driver of that. And then also the U.S. discount rate has gone up about 25 basis points, simply a reflection of where interest rates ended the year. Don Bullock : Our next question comes from Chris Glynn with Oppenheimer. Chris Glynn : So with the kind of commentary on the multiyear share repurchase plan, you opened up to some longer term, just looking at the capital structure. I think in 2017, you\u2019ve got a hefty debt coming due, billion of that. Is that extremely low rate? Are we looking at roll over to stay consistent with comments on excess cash to repurchase, or is the current 2.5 times leverage still above a sustainable zone, so more of a bevy of commentary than a single question there. Rick Fearon : Our expectation Chris is that we would refinancing the debt coming due in 2017. Chris Glynn : And then lastly on the split from the first half, second half. Given the highly strategic year and period of restructuring program, maybe give color on the ramp of benefits into the second half just in terms of perhaps an earnings split of the first half and the second half within the annual context? Sandy Cutler : As I mentioned, the restructuring cost is 70 in the first, 35 in the second, and then the last 35 across the last two. And then from a benefits point of view, all of the benefits occurs in quarters two, three and four, and they build as you go from quarter-to-quarter. So the higher savings will be out in the third and fourth quarter. Don Bullock : Thank you all for joining us today. Unfortunately we\u2019ve reached the end of our allotted time for the call today. As always, we\u2019ll be available for follow up calls for the remainder of the day and the rest of the week. And again thank you very much for joining us today. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference today. We\u2019d like to thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Teleconference. You may now disconnect.",

Any of the areas of uncertainty around those will be outlined in our 8-K. And with that, I'll turn the comments over to Sandy. Sandy Cutler : Great, thanks Donny. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. I'll be working again from the presentation that was posted earlier this morning and why don't we turn to Page 3, it's entitled Highlights of Q1 Results. I think as you saw from our earnings release. Our quarter was slightly ahead of original expectations coming in the upper half of our range. It positions us very much on plan for our full year guidance and really not much has changed in terms of our view of either how markets will progress this year. We're seeing the economy, nor how we see our prospects for this year. You saw the operating earnings per share were $0.88. Our sales of $4.8 million were down 8% from a year ago organic revenue was down 6%. You may recall it, as compared to the fourth quarter. We had said that we had expected our first quarter sales to be down about 5%. We actually came in a little bit better than that. And then the Forex impact down 2%. Really strong segment margins, exactly in line with what we'd outlined in terms of our guidance and when you exclude the restructuring cost that are part of our three-year restructuring program margins were actually 15.1%, that are really quite strong for our business mix in the first quarter. Very pleased with our cash flow, the first quarter $371 million. We were able to purchase back $100 million. We recall our full year plan as a $700 million buyback and then we announced the dividend increase a 4% increase in February. If we move on to Page 4 and just to comparison to our guidance, pretty simple. Higher revenue, than we expected primarily organic, a little bit FX for $0.02. And then we did spend a little bit less than we had anticipated. We had shared with you, that we were going to spend on the order of $70 million in the first quarter for restructuring expense that total came in closer to $63 million. So that contributed about a $0.01 was up. I'll mention in just a couple minutes. We do expect to spend those dollars of later in the year and I'll come back and talk a little bit more about that. But overall, $0.88 great start for the year. Turning to Page 5, I think you saw most of these numbers in the press release. I would remind you, that our fourth quarter volume, fourth quarter 2015 was $5.057 billion and so as you can see, came off just a little bit less than the 5%, we had guided to. Our organic growth in the fourth quarter was 4%. Here in the first quarter, it was a negative 6%. We anticipate this is the worst quarter in terms of the year-over-year. You know that our full year guidance is a negative 2% to a negative 4%. Clearly, the comparisons in the second half get quite a bit easier than they are here in the first part of the year. If we could flip to the individual segments. Now and we'll start with the Electrical Products segment, you'll find that on Page 6 of the packet. Clearly, a very good quarter. A number of you commented on that already, this morning that we're very pleased with the 16.1% operating margin, 17.1% without restructuring cost. If you look at our organic sales growth, it was zero or flat, this quarter. It was a negative 1% last quarter. And we're encouraged that our bookings in the first quarter were 2%. You may recall, that in the fourth quarter of last year they were negative 1% and they were flat in the third quarter of last year. So a little bit of an acceleration. And as you look around the world and I'm sure you're all interested in terms of trying to understand sort of the tenor of the business and where the strength or weaknesses around the world. The US continues to be stronger than that average of 2%. We're very pleased, what we saw or may have begun to tick up a little bit and I think that's in line with what you saw in some of releases last night, early this morning about more economic strength in the European region. The weakness continues to be in Asia. Where we've seen double-digit downs in Asia and I think, not only us, but you've heard from other companies\u2019 conditions in Asia continue to be quite weak. Among the individual products, we had talked to you that generally the theme that we've been seeing over the last nine months. There's been weakness in industrial markets, more strength in residential and non-residential construction. We actually had a very good quarter in our single phase of power quality in our comment, when we get to systems and services. We also did in our three phase in that area. If we flip to the next chart please, which is Chart 7, Electrical Systems and Services segment, the volume of $1.342 billion down about 10% from the fourth quarter. You remember the fourth quarter was $1.494 billion and I think as we told you, a good way to think about this segment in terms of shipment in prospective shipment volumes is to look at bookings. And so bookings were down 2%, this quarter. You recall in the fourth quarter, they were also down 2%. In the third quarter, they were down 3%. So we continue to see weakness here and a number of traces to some of the macros that we've all discussed. Our Crouse-Hinds business it has a significant oil and gas exposure is in this segment. Some of the large industrial projects that we would tend to work on are in this area. We continue to see those weak as well. And so that as we continue to look to the year, I'll talk to you a little bit about segment margins. We started off a little lower then we'd anticipated. With might, that's why we revised our margins for the year. I'll comment more on that, as we get to the next couple charts. Within the regional area again, the US and EMEA being stronger areas, our weaker areas being Asia Pacific at this point. So our common theme and you'll hear that in number of our businesses. Moving to next chart, Chart number 8 or Page 8, our Hydraulics segment. Sales of $551 million. Virtually flat with what we saw in the fourth quarter. You remembered it was $552 million at that point. You'll see the operating margin is 7.4% and when you exclude the restructuring 10.3%, obviously we're doing a lot of work in this segment has we had shared with you and as Craig and his team had outlined at our February, New York Analyst Meeting. The organic sales down to 14%. We recall they were down 12% in the fourth quarter. Bookings down some 10% and here we saw weakness in the US, as well as in Asia Pacific. I don't think the story is much different here in terms of our seeing weakness both on the distributor and on the OEM side. And we've seen weakness both on the stationary and the mobile side. So to the question, we bottomed in our hydraulic end markets. We don't have the visibility to see that it has bottomed at this point. We're comfortable and we shared with you some revised views of market growth in this area and so, our plan is very much the same to continue to restructure this business, during 2016 and not to count on a upturn in terms of volume. Turning to Page number 9, our Aerospace segment. Volume is up just slightly from the fourth quarter down from a year ago, but really terrific, terrific results in terms of our operating margins 18% in the quarter, 18.9% without the restructuring. Very solid second quarter in a row, bookings up 6%. Our aftermarket was down in this particular quarter. But we really believed that's much more of an issue having had a very large quarter of aftermarket booking in the first quarter 2015. So we don't think this is trend. We think it's really much of a comparable issue. Organic growth was down 3%. It was positive in the fourth quarter about 2%. So little lower growth but really strong margins and strong bookings. If we turn to Page 10, our vehicles segment. Cleary, we're beginning to see some of the impact of our original forecast of the North American heavy duty truck market coming down to 250. We've actually now changed our full year forecast of coming down to 230,000 units. At first quarter, it was relatively strong but and we can talk more in the Q&A, as we've seen production schedules and orders progress into this year. It's our sense that this market is going to be closer to 230 range than the 250 range, all this is already in our guidance. Strong margin performance, you see the organic sales down some 13%. We recall they were down 6% in the fourth quarter as we've begun to see this kind of roll over if you will in the heavy duty market. If we move to the next page, Page 11. No change in terms of our view of total organic revenues for this year. Still we believe they'll come down 2% to 4%. Obviously, for the first quarter was down 6%. This does anticipate and we do believe, that we'll see much better comparisons as the year come on, so this center point of negative 3%. As we looked at our first quarter experience and our update of looking at individual markets, you'll see two changes on this page from the guidance we provided you earlier this year. We've raised the guidance in terms of organic growth in electrical products, a great first quarter, residential markets stronger than we've had originally anticipated. Those being the two big contributors to our increasing our guidance for electrical products. Then in the vehicle markets, really two changes there. That's a North American heavy duty market as I mentioned to you, would be down at about 230,000 units of production versus the 250,000, we had originally anticipated. So that's about 29% reduction the 230 over last year. And then Latin America continues to be weak and clearly we all are I think up-to-date with the tremendous problems in Brazil currently, and that's done nothing but weaker markets further and so, those really being the two changes within the vehicle market. Overall, sales 2% to 4%. Quick update on our restructuring actions on Page 12. We recall again a three-year program. That is the work that's going on by teams all across the company, really well done. Keeping very much to our schedules, we did as I mentioned in my original comments this morning. We incurred bout $63 million of restructuring expense versus the guidance we had provided you of roughly $70 million. We really have that, that expense of that $7 million will move out to the second half. We've got one project that's really moved from Q1 to Q3 but overall, we think that we will still be at about $140 million through restructuring cost. And as you look at the $42 million in the second half just to give you some sense for pacing, we think about 70% roughly of that is likely to be in the third quarter, with the remaining roughly 30% will be in the fourth quarter. Importantly, our overall year-to-year incremental annual benefits of $185 million remained unchanged. Some of you may ask, how can you have a project move out and it doesn't change your overall, benefits. Remember that these incremental $185 million of savings included both carryover benefits from actions we had taken last year in 2015, as well as the new actions, we've taken in 2016. It was in that overall mix, there are obviously our projects moving ahead and back and quite lot of activity overall, we're very comfortable with $185 million still being realized here in 2016. On Page 13, its titled segment operating margins expectations. I mentioned to you, we made a couple changes here that relate to changes really what's going on in the market again. Our electrical products, as you can see we've moved our guidance up to 17.4% to 18.0% for margins after the very strong first quarter that we've had. You recall it, it was 17.0% to 17.6%. In our electrical systems and services, we've moved down to 13.1% to 13.7%. It previously had been 13.7% to 14.3%. Really just a couple items driving that, a little bigger commercial mix, a little weaker industrial mix and continued pressure in the oil and gas markets. No change in hydraulics, no change in aerospace. Then our vehicle business, we've moved it down to 16.2% to 16.8%, it was 16.7% to 17.3% and that's really the impact of the 230,000 units production for NAFTA heavy duty Class 8 versus our earlier forecast of 250,000 units. Looking ahead to the second quarter, after what we think, that is a very solid and good start to the year in the first quarter, Page 14 its entitled EPS guidance. On second quarter, our guidance is the range to a $1 to $1.10 operating EPS and it's virtually the same as net income because we don't have acquisition restructuring expense. Organic revenue sequentially moving up 5% from Q1, 2016 to Q2, 2016. As we've talked last couple of years, that is a pretty normal season for us, is that 5% step up from the first quarter to the second quarter. The first quarter is always our weakest quarter in terms of revenue. And then we would expect, this FX is turning out to be less than we had forecast earlier this year. That we expect, we'll get about a point bump up from Forex too, so likely revenue is up on the order is 6%. Our segment margins, including all the restructuring expense and the restructuring benefits as well as incremental on the higher volume in the second quarter between 15% to 16%. And a tax rate that will be between 10% to 12%. Our guidance for the year remains unchanged and each of the comments underneath the guidance on this page, are the same that you saw from us in our first quarter guidance, so no change there as well. If we move to Page 15, in 2016 outlook summary. Again, only changes that you find on this page, really no changes of this page. We just had some change, what I call the mix under a couple of these numbers. Once again, the operating EPS for this year is flat with a year ago and the net income per share is up some 2%. So if you move to Page 16, a quick summary of our report today. Again, we think a really strong start to the year's solid first quarter. Record, first quarter cash flow and continuing to buy back shares as well as obviously have a dividend increase. 2016, as I mentioned earlier. We really don't see the year much differently than we did, when we laid out the guidance first year and laid out our operating plan and that's why we're continuing to work on our $400 million restructuring plan and the $3 billion share buyback plan because I think they're exactly what's needed during a period of this type of economic weakness. We tuned two things within 2016, one is the modestly weaker NAFTA heavy duty production forecast and the second is that, we think Forex is now likely to be impact our revenues by negative $200 million versus the original negative $400 million. I'm sure, we'll have questions about why our EPS full year guidance hasn't changed and the very easy way to think about this is, roughly the reduction in Forex negative impact on sales and profit, basically offsets the lower market expectation now for the NAFTA heavy duty truck forecast. Our restructuring program just full of good news here, continues to be very much as we thought, being able to realize the potential. Our teams are really creating great results around the world and our full year incremental benefits remain unchanged at $185 million and the cost remain unchanged at $140 million. And as I said several times, already this morning, our capital allocation plan to buy back 700 million shares following the 682 million that we bought back last year remains unchanged. So with that, Don I'll turn things back to you. Don Bullock : With that, I'll turn it to the operator, who will then provide instructions for our question-and-answer session. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Don Bullock : Our first question this morning comes from Steve Winoker with Bernstein. Steve Winoker : I appreciate you moving that with lightning speed. And Sandy, I want to of course start by congratulating this might be your last earnings call, as CEO. Retiring and moving on. So fantastic, I think the stock is up like four times since you took over or more. So well done. I guess I'll just start also with tax and the treasury rules and regulations. Haven't really got a clear picture and how you're thinking about, how your tax rate may be impacted by this, the timing of intercompany loans etc. on a perspective go forward basis. If those proposed rules become final. Sandy Cutler : Great, thanks. Steve. I'll ask Rick to pick that up, it's obviously something we've given a lot of consideration to. Rick Fearon : Hi, Steve. We've obviously studied this at some gap and the conclusion we come to, we don't see any material financial impact to Eaton from the new regulations. We believe, our guidance for 2016 will not be impacted and in fact, the guidance I gave on the last call longer term, which is a tax rate between 10% and 15%, with the rate stepping up slowly from the 9% to 11% for this year. We think it's still the appropriate guidance for later year. So in some, we don't see any material financial impact from the regulations. We do however see the need for additional administrative actions to meet the documentation requirement, for the new regulation for new debt that you put in place. I think as you know, the regulations only impact new debt, they don't impact debt already in place, but those administrative actions won't have any material financial impact on Eaton. Steve Winoker : Okay, that's good to hear. Could you maybe dig into the electrical product improvement that you're seeing and I'm trying to get a sense also for what is and in this, probably goes some of the other segments? What sort of comp driven versus really fundamental demand changes. In this case, obviously LED penetration, large projects. Maybe just give us a stance for where the strength is business wise as opposed to just geography. Rick Fearon : I'll be glad to, as I mentioned. The couple areas clearly the residential businesses have been doing very well for us and so that's both in terms of the load center circuit breakers, pull outs as well as wiring devices. Lighting continues to be quite strong, the single phase power quality which we report in our electrical products area, has been strong as well and it has helped. That, what we've seen over the last couple of years is we've seen strengthen these areas in the US, that haven't seen much strength in Europe in that regard. Europe's had a far better quarter in that regard as well. So I would point to those as being the areas of real strength. The areas that have offset it, because you look at 2% and say that's not kind of growth we were seeing a couple years ago, then still the industrial markets. So that's both industrial MRO and industrial OEM continued to be the weak spots and so we see that on a number of our products, we sell directly into those markets. Steve Winoker : Okay, all right. Thank you. I'll pass it on. Don Bullock : Our next question comes from Ann Duignan with JP Morgan. Ann Duignan : Can we dig into the vehicle business a little bit Sandy or whomever wants to address it? That business, that Brazil piece is trucks and agriculture. Can you just talk about what you're seeing in the fundamental both of those businesses? Any either of them reaching trough [ph], any signs of life standard [ph] in either of those end markets, please. Sandy Cutler : Yes, I think its signs of life is maybe the right way to describe. Obviously the political and economic situation is so difficult in the country right now and to say, that we've got better transparency than anybody else on what's going to happen there. When we overestimate our capabilities to have those insights, so we continue to see this year's that, a year that is actually declining in Brazil. In our view of Brazil at this point, where our vehicle markets is, as I mentioned upfront worse than it was starting the year. So no, we're not seeing a turn in Brazil. Ann Duignan : Okay, thank you and then just a follow-up. Asia is a large place. When you talk about Asia across your different businesses is it all China or is there any other markets that are worth noting? Sandy Cutler : I think, China is clearly one of the big players in that regard and you know, we have for several years, felt that the China economic data was maybe a little bit more bullish then we were actually seeing at the street level. That continues to be true but, we're not seeing our business in China growing at this point and in fact, we've seen it pull back slightly. So and when you get into certain segments, you're seeing in our electrical business or example some of the utility activity in China has pulled back. And in our vehicle businesses, the markets on the light vehicle side has stayed relatively strong. They've been pretty choppy in the commercial vehicles, over the last couple of years. That's probably the biggest piece of, but I would say that Asia in general is not been stronger in this time period. Craig, would you want to add anything to that? Craig Arnold : No, I think you've covered. I mean, I think it's maybe a green shoot or two, in terms of what's going on in some of the hydraulic market. It's too early to really to call that we've hit bottom. But we certainly saw in the month of March and probably some of the other data that you follow as well that, perhaps some bottoming in some of the construction equipment markets in Q1, but once again probably too early to call if we've really reached bottom or not. Sandy Cutler : Say the one area maybe [indiscernible] didn't mention Ann is, that the aerospace markets really outside the US and that does include Asia, it remains strong. Ann Duignan : Right, thank you. That was pretty broad. So I'll leave it at there. Don Bullock : Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse. Julian Mitchell : Just on the vehicle segments again. Obviously, you went through last year in hydraulics in each quarter you were cutting the sales and or the margin guidance as you went through the year. One quarter in for vehicles you've cut the sales and the margin guidance. So I guess, what issues do you think different for this year, when you're looking at vehicles, guidance and the assumptions behind it versus where you were on hydraulics one year ago. Craig Arnold : Maybe I'll grab that one, Sandy, if you're okay, with that. But I say Julian the big change for us at vehicle this year really is centered largely on North America class 8 truck. The other market buy in large are performing as we anticipated. The light vehicle market in China is doing fine. Europe's in light vehicle is doing well. As you probably saw on some of the data, we're not a big player, but the truck market in Europe is doing well. Yes, we had some perhaps a little bit of another leg down in South America, but at this point the denominator is so small that it really doesn't matter a lot. And so really it's a function of the North America class 8 market, and coming into the year. We had a 250 number out there for the market, which was quite frankly one of the weaker numbers of anybody forecasting the market and coming into the earlier part of this year. It appears that we have about 20,000 units of inventory overhang, that's fundamentally affecting the North America class 8. If you take a look at 80 [ph] truck tonnage, where some of the key markets that are the indictors for those markets for longer term. Those markets are doing okay and so we're really, we're going to a bit of inventory correction right now, in North America class 8 and that's principally reading, we reduced our forecast. And that's 230, we think once again, we have one of the more conservative numbers out there. So at this juncture, we think we're well positioned in terms of the year and so we don't think, that there's going to be a case of every quarter another down to revision. Julian Mitchell : Thanks, Craig and then just my follow-up with the on the electrical businesses. Just wondered if you saw any change in demand trend as you went through the last few months in any of the major regions or verticals? Sandy Cutler : Yes, we've seen nothing substantial, Julian. And I think, a more broadly a number of people I'm sure are curious about how do we see March difference than January, February and I'd say that, not significantly different than we would normally see it, first quarter. So we have not seen an acceleration in demand if you will, that has been unusual in the month of March. And if go back to the comments that we made right at beginning of the call, is that. We see the year letting out very much as we did, number of you thought we were conservative in terms of our economic outlook for this year, but when we see US GDP coming up, the kind of numbers that did the other day. We think it's more confirmation that, this is likely to be a slow growth the year on the industrial side and the real premium has to be placed upon getting cost out and then trying to buy back shares and that's very much, what our plan is built around. Julian Mitchell : Very clear, thank you. Don Bullock : Our next question comes from Scott Davis with Barclays. Scott Davis : We've seen a bit of pop up in steel prices, copper things like that and I think at least in the US, your LIFO accounting, I think. Memory serves me right. But, are we at the point of cycle where you can go out and get price even potential a little bit more than just a pass through. Are we still just trying to get a pass through here and can you, probably get a pass through I guess particularly when you think about things like vehicle or hydraulics. Sandy Cutler : It maybe, these things have issues of timing and there is usually some sort of lag. I think, when I'll ask Craig to comment as well. We're more a view at this point, that we're getting slight positive in terms of margins as we mentioned our guidance this year from the tailwind. Yes, some things have picked up but I think you have to see pick up a little longer in this before you'd really see price traction from commodities. I don't know, Craig. How do you feel? Craig Arnold : And I absolutely agree with that. Despite the fact that we have seen a little bit of pick up you know over the last 30 days from a standpoint of planning assumption. We're still within in many cases below our original assumptions for the year around where commodities are going to go. So at this point, I think it'll be clearly premature to think about, we're moving into an inflationary piece of the cycle. Only balance that we've set in the past, we think our net between material cost coming down in price are about a net neutral for the company and we continue to believe that's where we're positioned. Scott Davis : Got it, fair enough. And, I don't think you guys mentioned M&A in your prepared remarks. At least, I didn't hear and no one's asked about it yet. But are there, transactions out there that you guys could perceive getting done by the end of the year? Craig Arnold : Yes, I'd say on the M&A front, what we said is that from a priority standpoint today. You know we're really focused on first and foremost, you know investing in our businesses to drive organic growth. We think we have plenty of opportunities to do that. Secondly, we said we're really focused on making sure that we maintain a strong dividend and then we also said, that share buyback in this environment where our stock is trading at below the valuation that we think is fair, is the priority. And so at this juncture, we continue to be focused on those priorities. We've committed to buy back $700 million worth of stock this year. And quite frankly, given our priorities right now we don't think there's going to be a lot of latitude from balance sheet standpoint to do much in the M&A front. There's always things that we're looking at on the margin and we'll continue to look, but today that's not the priority. Scott Davis : I'll pass it on to Sandy, congrats in your retirement and it's been a pleasure. So I'll pass it on. Sandy Cutler : Thanks, Scott. Don Bullock : The next question comes from Eli Lustgarten with Longbow Securities. Operator : Your line is open, sir. Eli Lustgarten : I'm sorry, can you hear me? Don Bullock : Yes. Eli Lustgarten : My best wishes to Sandy, upon retirement and I just hope you need to survive this summer. Sandy Cutler : Thank you. Eli Lustgarten : Other things also. We just started talking about, we're hearing a lot of price competition coming in a lot of markets in a break [ph]. Can you give us some idea, I mean, there's a lot of mentality among competitors that nobody wants to lose a deal, and pricing particularly outside this country is getting very, very competitive in what we're hearing. Can you give us some idea? I know you just talk about these, but you're still kind of neutral, but are we seeing any real changes in pricing competition around the markets. Sandy Cutler : I think if you see, if you look at our margins in the first quarter. That's maybe the best way to give you some sense, I'd say not that we haven't anticipated and with the benefit of all the work we're doing on restructuring. I think you're seeing our decrementals be extraordinarily low. And so, there's no question when commodities come down. You're going to see some impact. We talked about that in our last calls, but I don't think it's anything that we haven't really anticipated at this point. Craig Arnold : I agree completely, Sandy. And certainly in the negotiated project piece of the business there's always on the margins of some places where you're being more or less competitive and there's some regional differences, but on balance and across the company nothing that would not be consistent with the guidance that we provided, no indications that anything is changed. Eli Lustgarten : Okay, not much going on. And one of the things we're hearing a follow-up from lot of companies is, [indiscernible] are getting better but a decelerating decline across market and is that what you're seeing of course, anything. There's no expectation for things getting better very quickly it's part of the guidance. But are you seeing things stabilizing and even in the oil and gas sector. The question is, when do we anniversary the big declines that things begin to be more stable across the company. Sandy Cutler : I think the best, Eli to think about our volume forecast for this year is, while you've seen an organic decline for us in the first quarter 6% and then I mentioned to you, if you looked at our guidance for the second quarter and if you were to calculate it versus a year ago because I gave it you versus the first quarter and it will be less in the 6%. The comps for the second half get a lot easier and that's how we get to this down 2% to 4%. Now that's kind of quarter-to-quarter look, but I don't think we're saying that we're seeing markets begin to accelerate at this point. So we think we're kind of cruising down towards the bottom, if you will at this point. And we don't see a significant market growth at this point and so that's the kind of tough scenario we find ourselves in this low growth global environment and that's why again we put the premium on taking this time to do the restructuring and do the share buybacks. Eli Lustgarten : All right. Thank you very much. Don Bullock : Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Nigel Coe : Just wanted to holding on electrical. And firstly just on the system side. The down 2% to 3% order trends, I guess over the last two or three quarters. What should we expect revenue growth to recouple to that kind of cadence and then second part of that question would be on the Canadian Dollar. We've seen a pretty sharp strengthening of the Canadian Dollar. And I remember last year, you had some struggles with margin deleverage due to that weakening. So I'm just wondering the reversal of that trend, does that help you on the margin front. Sandy Cutler : Yes, first on the volume level and kind of the looking ahead. I do think as we mentioned Nigel, you correctly referenced it as at, looking at our bookings is a pretty good way to think about what's coming out ahead of in terms of these, the electrical systems and services segment. There is a portion of that business that does come in during the quarter and go out and that's the piece, it's a little higher for us to forecast. And in some cases, that is MRO for the oil and gas area. So that's an area it's a little harder for us to look ahead. I think and we entered this year, thinking oil and gas will be down on the basis of 15%. It's every bit of that, whether it turns out to be more than that, I guess we'll know come year end, but even though we've seen oil move up to the mid-40s. That segment is just not investing right now and there's still very much in a cutting back mode at this point. It's going to take some time before we see that start to come back from the other direction. I say the other issue for us to keep an eye on here as whether we start to see confidence in and around reinvestment in industrial projects and we're really not seeing that to-date and we think that's likely to take more time as well. You're right that the pricing is a Canadian Dollar versus the US because most of our production is in the US that we serve Canada with. It did hurt us last year. If it stays on a sustained basis and that's the key here, that will start to help us from a margin perspective. Nigel Coe : Okay, that's great and then just quickly. You gave us some good color on the end markets within electrical. You didn't talk about utility, which is about I think about 10% will serve your electrical sales, a bit more within systems. But it seems like distribution spending is coming back a little bit. I think first of all, have you seen that and how much of that's weather, what is your view going forward on distribution spending in the US? Sandy Cutler : Yes, we did see a little better quarter on bookings. So it comes in obviously bookings first on the distribution side. So you're correct. Have frankly seen that from a couple of our peers as well. There are some other issues going on within, what we call our Power Systems business currently in, you may recall there were regulations that were put in place about transformer last year. It caused sort of pop-up in bookings on the fourth quarter, a little bit of an overhang in the first quarter. We expect to see that stabilize as we go through the year. So, our original guidance of 0% to 2% for utilities, we did better than that in the first quarter. Nigel Coe : Great. Thank you very much. Don Bullock : Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with Buckingham Research. Josh Pokrzywinski : Just maybe to go back to some of the earlier questions on the complexion of business. Sandy, you touched on not a lot of appetite in the market place for project business. Are you seeing more stability though on the MRO and piece parts side, how would you characterize kind of the price or mixed dynamics between those as well? Sandy Cutler : Yes, I'd start and let me ask, Craig to comment on this too. But, I'll start with a couple of high level issues. Construction is better than industrial activity. So industrial activities around the user or the OEM side is weaker. And then when you get in fact, construction, construction is better on commercial than it is industrial and it's strong on residential. And when you get inside commercial, it's better in light commercial than it is in heavy commercial and that has been pretty much our experience through the much of last year, as well as we're seeing now. So we're not seeing strengthening on the industrial side and either the MRO or the user side. I think, you've seen that parallel on a number of our peers, who reported quite recently and their big weakness is been on the industrial side, both user and OEM and it's been on the large industrial project side, whereas strength has been moreover in the construction side, particularly light construction in residential. Josh Pokrzywinski : And would you characterize the light construction and I guess residential not as much as the business, but is that light construction profit mix favorable or because there ends up being more lighting in there and maybe a lower engineering content that it does hold down the margins and some of the strengths we're seeing is, really unrelated to that. Sandy Cutler : Again, I would say a lot of this industrial MRO and user it tends to flow into products and you typically in the industry you see products as a higher margin in systems and services. So it does play a little bit that way. Josh Pokrzywinski : All right, great. Thanks a lot guys. Craig Arnold : And that is more of a reason in terms of the margin guidance that we provided in electrical systems and services. Basically those margins and got it, really is that issue that the industrial sides of business, the MRO side of the business that tend to be a little bit more profitable and we're seeing relative weakness there and strength on the commercial side. Josh Pokrzywinski : All right. Great. I'll pass it along and Sandy, congratulations. Sandy Cutler : Thank you. Don Bullock : Next question comes from Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc. Jeff Hammond : Just back on the conversion changes, maybe two questions there. One, how do you think differently or not differently about tax re-spins and wanted or not wanted to do that, out beyond December 17. And then as you look at deals perceptively, how should we think about the ability? How do we look differently or the same at tax synergies within that? Rick Fearon : Yes, let me jump on that, Jeff. And I'll deal with your second question first. The new debt regulations as I said a bit earlier. Mainly impact us in having to have a more comprehensive documentation around newly issued intercompany debt and it doesn't seem likely that those requirements would significantly impact any financings, we would undertake as part of new acquisition. So we don't see much impact on future acquisition. In terms of, impact on spins those regulations haven't changed. It's a five-year some, five-year period from the time, that you undertake a transaction like the Cooper transaction. So as we get to the end of next year. We will be able to undertaken spin tax-free. Again there may be some more documentation for some of the financing around that, but we don't believe that the fundamental transaction will be impacted. Jeff Hammond : Okay, great. And then, Sandy or Craig, can you give us the quarterly cadence NAFTA truck production, how you're thinking about that? Sandy Cutler : That was 64 in the first quarter and where our thoughts, it's going to be approximately 60 in the second quarter and then approximately 54 in the third quarter and then 52 in the fourth quarter. Jeff Hammond : Okay, thanks guys. Rick Fearon : And all that's obviously in our guidance. Craig Arnold : Best guess recognizing, there could be a little bit of in precision [indiscernible]. Rick Fearon : Absolutely. Don Bullock : Our next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC. Deane Dray : And Sandy, you may have answered part of this question, in your response to Josh's question. But, it was interesting one of your big electrical products, should be there as yesterday talked about little more cautiously on non-res calling at flattish. But maybe, I don't believe they have as much exposure on the light commercial and residential. But just, how would you reconcile those comments among your distributors? Sandy Cutler : Obviously, we have many, many distributors across the country in Canada and most of the, my comments really to it NAFTA region is that, again for people who are participating in the really, really big projects on either the commercial side or the industrial side, it is not as strong. And so that it's really a quite a mix issues in terms of where you're exposed and again, it's the lighter commercial activity that's the stronger side of commercial and everyone's individual exposure will be little different depending upon which market and how they're rate in terms of services. We continue to see non-res as a pretty good year. We've talked about this kind of 3% to 5% growth here. So we're not talking about 10% year, but a good solid year. As we look at our negotiations and we talk about this, Deane over many years. Because of our very large sales force. We get a pretty good look at the projects that are out ahead of us as well and that's 10%, feels pretty good at this point. Deane Dray : Great, and then just second question. You called out the decremental this quarter and when we look at those, they really jump out as a positive in terms in tough markets in declining revenues, if you can manage somewhere in and around, a 25% decremental and you handedly did that. So with their actions, that you had to take within the quarter to manage to that, those numbers or was that prior restructuring. Sandy Cutler : Its' both. I mean, but thanks for asking the question. Because I think it is important for us all to remember that out of that $185 million of incremental savings year-to-year. A bunch of that is from actions we took last year. Remember we pivoted at the end of the first quarter and Craig and the whole team has really put in place the very aggressive set of restructuring. We obviously got benefits from that in the fourth quarter, we got benefits from that in the first quarter and obviously, will through this year. So in addition to that, now we've also kicked off this whole set of additional actions here in 2016. So we would not be able to have those light decrementals unless we have been working on this for some time at this point. Deane Dray : Great, thank you. Don Bullock : Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Jeff Sprague : Just wondering, if we could just go back one more time to tax. In particular, just thinking about the potential for spin off dynamic size. I appreciate that the five-year period may have not changed. But, I was also under the impression that perhaps there was just the high level of complexity, if you wanted to go down that path and I'm wondering is that complexity and kind of the disentangling of structures that you have in place currently, particularly in light of the treasury regulations would make us spin, especially difficult if not on economic. Rick Fearon : Yes, let me answer that. These new regulations really don't fundamentally affect a spin and disentangling any subsidiary to spin, is always a complicated exercise because sometimes the assets are not owned in a separate legal entity. Sometimes you need to sell a legal entity to another entity in order to create one vehicle that you could spin if you look at other companies that have gone through spins. It usually takes a period of month sometimes, even as much as a year to disentangle all that. but it's really is a function of just getting all the assets in businesses into a single legal entity and these new debt regulations won't have any significant impact on what you need to do. Craig Arnold : And maybe before we go too far down the path around kind of this magical line of demarcation that happens at the end of 2017. So we don't read too much in that, as we said in New York. We have a game plan for all of our businesses. And we have a game plan that we like. We laid out plan around, how we get these business to deliver significant market margin through the economic cycle, was due certainly participating in certain businesses that are most cyclical than other. But we're not sitting around waiting for 2017 to make some magical decision around what we do with our businesses. We have a game plan that we like and we think, each of these businesses will continue to contribute positively to the company as you've seen this year and then prior years. We know how to manage cyclical businesses and we know how to deliver growing margins despite the fact that, our markets are performing poorly right now. And so as we think about the company overall, we have to plan to run these businesses and I don't want to any much sitting around thinking that come the end of 2017 that we're going to announce some big transaction. We have a plan that we like, there's certainly risk in some of our markets as you saw in the vehicle discussion just recently. Clearly, we in some of markets being a little weaker than what we anticipated but we're not done with restructuring in the event that markets are a little weaker. We have lots of programs and plans lined up, to do more restructuring if we need to. So, we're very confident that we can deliver the margin targets that we laid out for each of our businesses independent of what happens with some of these end markets. Jeff Sprague : Thanks, Craig that's very helpful. Would it be also fair to say that, no plan so set in stone, that if there is significant economic value to be unlocked by doing something else, you would be open to doing that? Craig Arnold : Absolutely. It goes without question. We've done it many times in the history of the company as we shared with you in New York, in the event that we feel like these businesses no longer meet the expectation that we set out for everyone one them. Now we've demonstrated historically that we're willing to pivot and we're willing to divest it and so that's, it's still acquisition. Jeff Sprague : Thank you. Could I just have a little more color on lighting? I think Sandy just characterized it as strong, which I'm sure it is, but can you give us a little bit of color on how quickly it's growing, whether the LED penetration is, a couple metrics around the business. Sandy Cutler : Sure, maybe two that might be helpful to you, Jeff. Is that our LED business is not over 60% of our total lighting business and so, we really think see it continuing to leading that respect. That LED business grew it over 30% in the quarter and so it continues to be a very fast growing and exciting area. And part of the advantage and you've seen a lot of reports come out after light there is that, every one of our competitors has its own unique strengths and weakness. We again are the only company that's really able to combine all the advantages of independent lighting with the full power control and distribution system in the building and that's really where we think, we build very unique value for our customers. Jeff Sprague : Thank you very much. Don Bullock : Our next question comes from David Raso with Evercore. David Raso : Two question on cash flow. I thought the cash flow in the first quarter was pretty strong. Definitely one of your strongest first quarters on record, I think you said. The cash flow to the full year. I'm surprised it was an increase. I think from the analyst meeting one of the more interesting statements was, how much stronger you expect the cash flow to be, this five-year period versus the prior. What was going out with the lack of cash flow increase? Sandy Cutler : I would David, really and I would say this about a number of elements out of the first quarter. It's still early. We're - end of the first quarter and that we really, what we're seeing the danger in the kind of slow economic times is, just assuming that everything continuously get better. I think by the time you get to the end of the second quarter or middle of the year it's probably more appropriate time to look at this. David Raso : Okay, so it's fair to say that cash flow year-to-date is ahead of plan? Sandy Cutler : We had said that remember, a full year is that we would have a cash efficiency ratio of one or better and that's still very much our plan. David Raso : Okay, one last just housekeeping. Maybe I missed it. The net savings or if you want, even lay out the cadence of the $185 million of savings over the four quarters. How did it play on the first quarter and the rest of the year? Sandy Cutler : Yes, we'll give you a full accounting on this by quarter, when we get to the end of the year. But I think the best way to think about this is, approximately 45% of that savings is in the first half, approximately 55% to the second half. And you might say, how could you get that much in the first half, remember part of it is, the carryover for the full year benefit for actions that were initiated in 2015, that was our plan coming into the year. It's built into our quarterly guidance and so again, hopefully that plus the kind of layout we gave you for the restructuring expenses on the charts that are in the presentation, give you a sense for help out the cost and the benefits lay out over the year. David Raso : So the net actions in the first half are still slightly negative than the positive delta of second half? Sandy Cutler : Yes, I think, yes. Correct. David Raso : Okay, thank you very much. Don Bullock : Our next question comes from Shannon O'Callaghan with UBS. Shannon O'Callaghan: On hydraulics margins. Maybe just a little bit more color on how you feel the actions there taking hold and when do you think, you can get those to kind of the low teens expectation extra structuring when does, when sort of the demarcation line for them to be required to get there. Sandy Cutler : Yes, its' a great question and it's a as you appropriately pointed out. So much of restructuring, we're doing across the company today and going back into 2015 is absolutely focused on the hydraulics bit. And today we have margins that are running as you see, in the 10% to 11% when you look at both Q1 and Q4 less restructuring and we're, I'd say order of magnitude about half way through the restructuring opportunities that we're working through. So we really think, by time we get to the end of this year, for early next year that we ought to be having a business at this level of economic activity, not banking on any significant recovery markets that is running the low-teen rates. Shannon O'Callaghan: Okay, great, that's really helpful and then. Rick sorry to beat the tax thing to death here, but you know a lot about this. [indiscernible] more, is the fact that there is not an impact and you're still, your 10 to 15 is still hold, is that because potentially differing treatment within equity and things like that, doesn't have an impact or is it because you've already incorporated some tax-free into your range in the first place, when you say 10 to 15. Rick Fearon : Well we had very carefully put together our financing plan for Cooper and really all the financings we've done over the years. And we've been very careful to be compliant with all the different IRS, Safe Harbor's and IRS Regulations and so, these new debt regulations don't really impact if you follow carefully those prior rules and so that's why, it doesn't have much impact on us. Shannon O'Callaghan: Okay, great. Thanks a lot. Don Bullock : Our next question comes from Andrew Owen with Bank of America. Andrew Owen : Sandy, congratulations for great work over your tenure. Sandy Cutler : Thank you. Andrew Owen : Just question on aerospace aftermarket. Bookings were down on the first quarter, is it tough comp or what's driving it and any risk to aerospace margin in the second half of 2016 from lower aftermarket? Sandy Cutler : Really a tough comp on the aerospace aftermarket. We had a really exceptional first quarter last year, with a number of our large aerospace distributor. So we're not concerned that this is a bigger trend. Rick Fearon : And in fact, we take a look at what happened with revenue passenger miles and generally ii in Q1. It feels like the consumer is very much in the economy jumping on planes and those numbers were up solidly and perhaps little strong than we originally anticipated starting the year so. It's an encouraging sign, that consumers continue get on planes and ultimately that's good thing for aftermarket. Andrew Owen : And just a follow-up question on China particularly on the electrical side. You know because the way I think about the cycle by the time, machine manufacturers will places orders for your equipment, by the time you ship it, things are probably have been turning for a while, what are the leading indicators that you guys use internally to gauge the state of the Chinese market particularly on the electrical side? Sandy Cutler : So I'd say that, maybe there a couple there, there's a large project business obviously that goes on, it has a lot to do with utility and infrastructure, there you get some look and awful lot of our business in China though is daily flow business and whether that's on a power quality or whether it's in the power distribution side, that's a lot harder to gauge because it has a lot to do with how inventories are distribution and whether the OEM or the construction side of the market is moving very quickly. So we don't get a lot of lead time in China. We probably get a better view here in the US than we do in China in terms of future view. Andrew Owen : Thank you very much. Don Bullock : With that, we going to have time for one more question this morning and I'll ask, Andy Casey with Wells Fargo. Andy Casey : Good luck to you, Sandy. Sandy Cutler : Thanks very much, Andy. Andy Casey : Question on the ESS, you talked about weak industrial markets in the current period, but I'm wondering, if what you mentioned in the past conference calls about some of the large industrial projects maybe starting to come on during the second half. I'm wondering if that's still the case or have they just been pushed out again? Sandy Cutler : Yes, I would say outside of projects that we're committed that contracts behind when there were some of those natural gas in that, in that area and they may not like their contract so much today. I'd say, we aren't seeing the big projects come on for the second half. Andy Casey : Okay, thanks and then lastly, in vehicle. I just wanted to ask question about the automotive side specifically in North America. There is been some concern about current dealer inventory levels and I'm wondering, if you're starting to hear any commentary about potential changes in production schedules for some of your customers in the second half? Craig Arnold : Yes at this point, we think, we've really have not heard anything that would suggest that there's any concern in terms of our view. We still think, 17.3 million units is a good forecast for the North America auto market. Incentives have certainly creaked up a little bit. We track the number of dollars of incentives for vehicle that are being offered to encourage consumers to come and by and that maybe a little indication of some concerns. But by in large, at this point and we think our forecast is still valid and there is no real indication that the market won't grow - relatively modestly this year, but off of a high base. Andy Casey : Okay, thanks Craig and once again, Sandy. Thanks for all your help over the years. Sandy Cutler : Thanks, Andy. Don Bullock : And maybe a way of concluding today's call. This is I think, if I counted correctly it's my 59th earnings call with Eaton. And all of us here in the management team really appreciate your support. Your questions and your helping us sort of think through many of really key issue in and around running a business successfully. I've got enormous confidence in Craig and this team and I hope you're beginning to share that confidence at this point. A lot of experience here on this team and Eaton's best days are ahead of us. So we hope we'll continue to earn your support. Thanks very much. I've enjoyed working with all of you. Don? Don Bullock : With that, as always, we will be available for follow-up questions for the remainder day and all of next week. Thank you very much for joining us today. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. We thank you for your participation and using the AT&T Executive Teleconference. You may now disconnect.",

(Broker) Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Eaton Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to our host, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Don Bullock. Please go ahead, sir. Donald H. Bullock - Senior Vice President- Investor Relations : Good morning. I'm Don Bullock, Eaton's Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank all of you for joining us for Eaton's second quarter 2016 earnings call. With me today are Craig Arnold, our Chairman and CEO; and Rick Fearon, our Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer. The agenda today as normally includes opening remarks by Craig highlighting the company's performance in the second quarter and our outlook for the remainder of 2016. As we've done in our past calls, we'll be taking questions at the end of Craig's comments. Couple of quick housekeeping items. The press release today from our earnings announcement this morning and the presentation we'll go through have been posted on our website at www.eaton.com. Please note that both the press release and the presentation do include reconciliations to non-GAAP measures and a webcast of the call is accessible on our website and will be available for replay. Before we get started, I want to remind you that our comments today do include statements that are related to expected future results and as a result, are forward-looking statements. Our actual results that may differ from this for a wide range of uncertainties and risks, they're described in our earning release and in the 8-K. With that, I'm going to turn this over to Craig Arnold. Craig Arnold - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Okay. Hey. Thanks, Don. Hey, I'm sure you've all had an opportunity to work through the material and so I'll hit a few of the highlights and add a bit of color to the results. Operating earnings per share, we're really pleased with the results in the quarter at $1.07, $0.02 ahead of our guidance. And as we anticipated, sales in the quarter came in at $5.1 billion, down 5% organically \u2013 down 5% \u2013 organic revenue down from 4%, and this is really consistent with the normal patterns that we see. Q2 sales at 5% above Q1 and quite frankly, FX was a little better, 1% better than it was in Q1 as well. Segment operating profits came in at 15.4% versus our guidance of between 15% and 16%, and I'd say with particularly strong margins in Electrical Products as well as in Aerospace, both of which came in at 18.6% when you exclude some of the restructuring charges, and offsetting a bit of weakness in Electrical Systems and Services. Restructuring costs in the quarter came in right as expected at $35 million and reducing our margins by some 60 basis points. Adjusting for restructuring costs and FX, really strong decremental performance by the company overall in each of our businesses. And we're really pleased with the fact that we had record cash flow in Q2 with cash conversion of 124% of net income, so really strong cash performance in the quarter. We also repurchased some $225 million of our stock back, some 3.7 million shares in the quarter. Turning to the financial summary, we continue to see weakness in the number of our end markets versus 2015 but sequentially revenues were up some, as I mentioned, 6% from Q1. Organic revenue declines and FX headwinds are decelerating. Organic revenue was down some 6% from Q1 but \u2013 in Q1, but only 4% in Q2 and as I mentioned, FX also mitigating a little bit, down 1% in Q2 versus 2% in Q1. Margins, excluding restructuring costs, were some 16%. That's up 90 basis points from Q1, and an improvement over Q2 of 2015 by some 10 basis points. And this is despite some 4% weaker organic revenues, so a real indication that we're getting and we're holding onto the restructuring benefits that we're engaging in across the company. Turning our attention to Electrical Products segment, a really strong quarter of execution in this business. We're pleased with the Q2 results and we think strong overall performance that we continue to see in this business. Modest year-on-year organic growth, up some 1% offset by FX, but in acceleration sequentially with revenues up some 10% from Q1. We continue to see strong execution in the business as evidenced by the significant margin improvement. Excluding restructuring, our operating margins were up some 270 basis points and 150 basis points better than Q1. Bookings were down 2% in the quarter on weakness in the Americas' industrial markets and really broad-based weakness in the Asia Pacific region. We did continue to see strength in U.S. residential housing, in the lighting markets and in Europe generally. Looking at Electrical Systems and Services, revenues in the quarter were up some 6% from Q1 but 5% worse than Q2 2015. Margins were weaker in Q2 2015 on less favorable mix of projects and also on the impact of a litigation charge that we actually took in this particular business that reduced margins by some 70 basis points. So note margi7ns excluding restructuring costs were in fact flat with Q1. While somewhat offset by lower commodity prices, the pricing environment in this business does continue to be somewhat difficult and as we've characterized the net between the two, we'd say slightly negative on a net commodity cost basis but certainly manageable and well within our guidance. Bookings are down some 2% and we're seeing continued weakness here in large industrial projects, weakness in Canada in oil and gas markets, partially offset by strength in three phase UPS, principally in data centers. Light commercial orders continue to be strong as well as the Service business. In looking at Hydraulics, hydraulics markets, I'd say they appear to be stabilizing, but more importantly, I think our team is executing well here. Organic revenues are up some 7% from Q1 but down 7% from last year. 10% margins in the quarter but I think importantly 13% when you exclude restructuring costs and we think real proof point that the restructuring work that's being undertaken in the business delivering the margin improvements is really coming through. So ex restructuring costs, profits were essentially flat on 7% lower organic revenue growth, and so we think really strong performance. Bookings declined some 2% in the quarter. Really the best quarter that we've seen in bookings in the last two years, on particular strength in EMEA and positive bookings in Asia with the modest weakness continuing in the Americas. In the quarter, OEM orders were down 4%, distribution orders were down 1%, and really the area of greatest weakness in the business continues to be on the stationary side of the business where we had orders were down, in some cases, up to 33%. We did see strength in the quarter in ag, up 23%. Not sure how much of a read-through that is on the total year as we continue to see some concerns there. And construction orders in the quarter were up some 8%. In Aerospace, we think our strong operating result in the quarter. Organic revenues were flat with Q2 2015, principally on lower military OEM sales offset by strength in both large commercial transport and in aftermarket. Margins were once again very strong at 18.6%, up some 160 basis points over Q2 2015. Bookings were down 1% in the quarter, and this is on particular weakness in the bizjet segment, which was a little bit of some surprise weakness for us, but when you just for weakness in bizjet, bookings were up mid-single digits and aftermarket orders continue to be strong, up some 7%. We also continue to see strength in commercial transport segment, where we saw orders up some 10% in the quarter. In looking at Vehicles, organic revenues were down 14% versus Q2 2015, driven primarily by the 29% decline in Class 8 market and continued double digit market declines that we're seeing in the Brazilian market. Outside of Brazil, passenger car markets continue to hold up at very high levels and we expect markets in North America to be flat with modest growth in EMEA and in Asia. Margins, when you exclude restructuring costs, were down some 230 basis points versus 2015 but up 70 basis points versus Q1. So we think with or without restructuring costs, we think strong operating performance in this business and where you're really dealing with some pretty significant headwinds in terms of the Class 8 market and what's happening in Brazil in general. If we turn to the organic growth outlook for the year, maybe I'll spend a few extra minutes on this slide just to give you some color on the way we see the year unfolding. In general, we think markets on balance are performing as we expected, but we do expect the market to remain sluggish throughout the balance of the year. And looking at Electrical Products, we'd say here a really mixed story in terms of what's going on in our end markets. We see growth in residential and lighting in the U.S., growth in Europe, but we continue to see declines in industrial markets in the U.S., Canada and in Asia. More specifically, we're seeing growth in U.S. residential markets; we think growth in the 5% to 7% range. We're seeing growth in the U.S. lighting market which we'd say is mid-single digit, and we see growth in Europe and we think Europe, EMEA grows some 2% to 3%. And this is offset by weakness in U.S. industrial markets, which we think will be down mid-single digit; weakness in Canada, which we think is down low single digit; and continued weakness in the Asia Pacific region, which we think is also down low-single digit range. In Electrical Systems and Services, we continue to see declines in large industrial projects, in oil and gas, but some growth in three phase, in power quality in the U.S. market and in Europe with modest growth in Power Systems. More specifically, we see U.S. and EMEA three phase power quality up low-single digit. We see some real weakness in harsh and hazardous, we think down some 15% for the year. We think industrial projects continue to be down and light commercial continues to be a source of strength in the business and once again Asia Pac we think will be down low- to mid-single digits for the year. Turning our attention to Hydraulics, and certainly we had a relatively speaking stronger quarter in Hydraulics, and we think in many ways this is really a function of easier comps as we move forward during the course of 2016. We continue to see weakness in mobile, particularly in ag equipment, we see certainly continued weakness in oil and gas equipment markets, double-digit declines in China construction. So our call on the Hydraulics markets really has not changed materially from the way we originally saw the year. In Aerospace we're seeing low-single digit growth in commercial OE and in commercial aftermarket, offset by, as I'd mentioned earlier, some pretty significant declines in the bizjet segment, which really took orders down in Q2. Some small declines in U.S. defense OEM and some modest growth in defense aftermarket. In Vehicle, as we noted, NAFTA Class 8, we think 230,000 units this year, down some 29%. And we continue to see weakness in the Brazilian truck and bus market. We think down 20% for the year offset by low-single digit growth in NAFTA Class 6 production and some modest growth, as I mentioned, in the light vehicle markets around the world. If we turn our attention to restructuring, really good news here. Restructuring programs remain on track, Q2 spending came in right at plan at $35 million and our projects are clearly on track and we have great line of sight to delivering the benefits that we laid out. We did increase our second half spending by $5 million, primarily in Electrical Systems and Service to deal with some of the continued weakness that we're seeing in some of our markets, principally oil and gas and industrial markets. We expect to spend $27 million in Q3 and another $20 million in Q4, increasing our total spending for the year to $145 million, but we've also increased our annual benefits by $5 million and so really no net change in benefits for the year. So in total we now expect the program to cost $404 million in total with benefits of $423 million, both up $5 million from prior forecast. Turning our attention to the segment margin expectations, not much in the way of change here overall. On a consolidated basis unchanged from prior guidance, however we did make a minor adjustment in guidance for both Electrical Systems and Services and in Aerospace. ES&S down some 30 basis points on continued weakness, principally in the higher margin oil and gas and industrial projects. And Aerospace up some 30 basis points on the basis of ongoing strength in aftermarket and really tight control in development costs inside of the business. Each of the other businesses are expected to be within the ranges noted and you'll recall that these guidance numbers do in fact include restructuring expenses. Turning our attention to EPS guidance, guidance for Q3 reflects continuation of the current overall softness in a number of our end markets. We think organic revenues in Q3 and Q4 are essentially flat with Q2. Flat revenue, but the variances to last year will improve as a result of, as I mentioned earlier, easier comps. Margin expectations will be between 15.5% to 16.5% reflecting lower restructuring expenses and increased benefits from Q2 and Q3. We think the tax rate will be 8% to 10% in Q3 versus 11% in Q2 and the midpoint of our guidance remains unchanged at $4.30 but we did in fact narrow the range by $0.05 on both the high side and the low side. Turning our attention to the outlook for 2016, the summary table that we normally provide in these calls, I'd say here the key changes are once again we updated Q3 guidance $1.10 to $1.20, a slight increase in foreign exchange negative benefits by $25 million and as I mentioned before, simply narrowing the range but holding the guidance at $4.30. So in summary, we think really a strong quarter in Q2. The teams are executing extraordinarily well. Revenues came in more or less as expected with strong performance in Electrical Products and Aerospace offsetting some of the weakness that we're seeing in Electrical Systems and Services and Hydraulics really showing strong margin improvement excluding restructuring charges in the quarter. And once again, really importantly, record cash flow as the businesses are really doing a nice job of converting net income to cash. We remain committed to our $700 million of share repurchase. We repurchased 3.7 million shares in the quarter, $225 million. Markets are unfolding as we expected and the full-year outlook is unchanged at down 2% to 4%. And the restructuring programs are basically delivering. $174 million of incremental profit in 2016 over 2015 and it's setting up well for us to deliver another $120 million of incremental profit in 2017 over 2016. So I'll stop here, turn it back to Don, and we'll go to question and answer. Donald H. Bullock - Senior Vice President- Investor Relations : At this point would our \u2013 commentator will provide some guidance for you on the Q&A session. Operator : Thank you. Donald H. Bullock - Senior Vice President- Investor Relations : Before we enter into the question-and-answer session today, I did want to note that we have a number of people in the queue for questions, and to try to be able to keep things within the constraint of an hour for us, I would ask you that you limit your questions to a single question and a follow-up, and as always, we'll be available to go into more detailed questions or others throughout the remainder of the day or otherwise. With that, our first question today comes from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thanks a lot. Hi, Craig. Just firstly on the ESS margins, I think you're implying the second half margins are 14%-ish. Those are up maybe 150 points year on year and sequentially in the half. Revenues though, probably in the second half, probably not doing much year on year or sequentially. So maybe just clarify what it is you see in ESS that picks up in that second half. Craig Arnold - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, I'd say the first adjustment we'd say you need to make in terms of the underlying run rate of the business is the fact that we did have the legal settlement in ES&S in the quarter. That shaved some 70 basis points off of margin. Then secondly, as we move into the second half of the year, we will clearly see a little bit of volume lift but not dramatic, but the restructuring benefits that we've been undertaking during the course of the year also start to kick in and we will see a margin lift as a function of the restructuring benefits that are more backend loaded. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Got it. Thank you. And then just within the Electrical Products business, you did see that bookings turn down in Q2. It looks like the guidance for revenues has an acceleration in organic sales year on year in the second half. Are you seeing something in the bookings in Q3 already that suggests that that decline in bookings should be reversed now and that gives you the visibility on second half revenue? Craig Arnold - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, what I'd say on that one, Julian, is that when you take a look at the absolute level of revenue that we're forecasting for the back half of the year, it's really running essentially at Q2 levels. And so we don't really have a volume lift that's built into the second half of the year. And as I mentioned earlier, the comps in general get easier for all of our businesses. As you'll recall, we really saw a fall-off in our revenue during the course of 2015 in Q3 and Q4. So principally, we're saying we're going to be running at this current level of economic activity and revenue and it's a function of the comps versus prior period that appear to be a relatively change in the rate of change, but the absolute dollars don't really move much at all. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Great. Thank you. Donald H. Bullock - Senior Vice President- Investor Relations : Our second question comes from Rob McCarthy with Stifel. Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Good morning, Craig, and congratulations on a solid quarter and a good initial start. I guess the first question I would ask, with respect to ESS, aware of the litigation expense there and the margins. But could you talk \u2013 you did set the oil and gas exposure there, but could you talk about maybe the trends you're seeing there, oil and gas in general? And then as a follow-up to that, and this will constitute my follow-up, could you talk a little bit about the portfolio's oil and gas exposure beyond what the explicit exposure, what the implied exposure could be? Because I think what we struggle with sometimes is understanding what the second order effects of some of these industrials companies' oil and gas exposure is. So if you could comment on that, that would be very helpful. Craig Arnold - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, so I think there's three questions there, one, in terms of the margin impact in ES&S. We had this legal settlement related to a three-year old or so commercial negotiation that ended up impacting the Electrical Systems and Services segment. And so that did take our margins down by 70 basis points in the quarter. And just a commercial settlement from a prior matter. In terms of the company's exposure to oil and gas, most of our exposure that's inside of the electrical business is in the Electrical Systems and Services business. You'll recall that when we acquired Cooper, we also acquired a very large business called Crouse-Hinds that has a very big exposure to what we call harsh and hazardous markets including oil and gas. And so we're certainly seeing an impact in that business as well as in all of our businesses that are exposed to oil and gas. I'd say, in terms of the overall oil and gas market, I think at this juncture we'd say we certainly have not seen any improvement in oil and gas and maybe we've seen a little bit of deceleration in oil and gas. Not material changes from our original assumptions for the year, but clearly we've not seen any indications that that market has turned. And to your point around the second derivative and the other markets that are tied to oil and gas, I think we really have been experiencing all year that second derivative impact. And so yes, it's oil and gas but it's in many cases, oil and gas companies whether it's upstream or downstream, they all live under one roof. And so we've seen the other knock-on effects from oil and gas related industries already impact our business and is already reflected in our guidance. Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: I guess following up to that just briefly, do you think you have a number about, for planning purposes and otherwise, how you're thinking about that second order impact? Because I think you have a headline number for your oil and gas exposure, but do you have a number of about the outer ring of that penumbra? Craig Arnold - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, we really don't, Julian (sic) [Rob] (23:42). Appreciate the question and what you're trying to get at, but we really don't have a particular number. And once again, it's a really tough number to derive and we would just be hazarding a guess. And so what we try to think about today is, we understand the underlying run rate of our businesses and what we're experiencing today. We know that we're already experiencing the second derivative fall-off and that's the basis that we use to develop our guidance. Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: I'll leave it there. Thank you for your time. Craig Arnold - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Donald H. Bullock - Senior Vice President- Investor Relations : Our next question comes from Steven Winoker with Bernstein. Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hey, thanks, and good morning, guys. Just trying to understand here, on the margin front, you put up 10 basis points better ex restructuring. That's quite a performance given the volume leverage. So maybe just talk a little bit about what you're seeing, if you could give us some color around \u2013 you've mentioned price versus material, productivity versus wage inflation, leverage, mix, some stuff going on in corporate. Just a few of the puts and takes to help us understand how you get there and how sustainable it is. Craig Arnold - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. I'd say that principally, maybe if you cut through all the tape, more than anything, it's a function of restructuring, benefits, great cost control by the operating teams and good operational execution. Price versus commodity input costs, we mentioned that we are having a few challenges in Electrical Systems and Services, but if we think about the entire year, we think we're largely on plan and on expectations that there's that little bit of uncertainty around what the future looks like around commodity prices as you read all the same press clippings that I do. And we have seen a little bit of an uptick in some commodities in the last 30 days. We've seen others tick down. So we think, largely speaking, that commodity prices for the full year will be very much in line with what our expectations were. We're not getting leverage right now in the business because we're not, for the most part, growing volume, and so it really is a function of our business is doing a good job of flexing our costs in anticipation of this weak market environment that we're living in. Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. All right. We can follow up offline for some \u2013 maybe if we could put some numbers around some of that it'd be helpful. But on the cash side, maybe, look, that was also very strong performance. Maybe talk about some of the puts and takes there around working capital and others? Richard H. Fearon - Vice Chairman, Chief Financial & Planning Officer : Yeah, Steve, I'd be happy to. Really, quite a straightforward quarter from a cash standpoint. If you look at the combination of net income and depreciation and amortization, those two were almost $730 million of cash and then the balance is simply a small positive from working capital. As we've commented earlier in the year, we believe that we have opportunities to continue to take down inventory. We did take inventory dollars down some from Q1 to Q2, but we think we have further opportunities as we go through the year. So it's really just those three items : net income, D&A as well as a small positive from working capital. Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Great. Okay. Thanks. I'll pass it on. Donald H. Bullock - Senior Vice President- Investor Relations : Our next question comes from Ann Duignan with JPMorgan. Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yeah, good morning. You know you mentioned a few times some strength in Europe for different businesses. Could you just give us a little bit more color on that, where exactly and what segments that you're seeing strength? Craig Arnold - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, yeah, sure, Ann. Be more than happy to. I think what we've seen in almost every one of our businesses is relatively speaking versus our expectations for the year and all the geopolitical issues and everything else taking place in Europe, we've seen Europe generally perform slightly better than what we anticipated. And so it really does run the gamut. Certainly if you take a look at vehicle markets, and that's probably been a big standout this year, light vehicle production and sales has been up mid-single digit all year, so we're seeing real strength there. Hydraulics markets in Europe, while still negative, less negative than we anticipated. In fact, that market's we think down low-single digit this year which is a better outlook than we anticipated. On the Electrical side of the house, once again we're seeing growth for the most part in many of our end markets in Electrical Products and Electrical Systems and Services, and we think those markets grow slightly this year. We think up, once again, low single digit. So it's really, we'd say, been a broad-based kind of beat versus our internal expectations, modest but pretty broad, and at this point it's too early to say. And your follow-up question may be in terms of what happens with Brexit and the Turkey matter. At this point it's too early to say. On the positive side we are, today, a net exporter out of the UK so we don't think that is going to have a big issue and the same thing would be true of Turkey. So really it's been a broad-based, we'd say, beat where Europe in general has performed slightly better than what we anticipated. Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And since you answered my follow-up, I'll switch to a different follow-up then. Craig Arnold - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Okay. Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC : On the Hydraulics side, which specific end markets? Was it mobile, was it industrial hydraulics? Just a little bit of color on the Hydraulics side that was less negative. Craig Arnold - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, that's great. It was pretty much primarily the mobile side that came in for the quarter stronger than what we anticipated. As I mentioned, strong ag orders up from 23% in the quarter, strong construction orders up 8%, offset by ongoing and pretty significant weakness that we still see in the stationary side of the business. The process industries, oil and gas, large industrial, very much like what we're seeing in the Electrical side of business, and that continues to be quite weak. Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. I'll leave it there in the interest of time. Thank you. Craig Arnold - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Ann. Donald H. Bullock - Senior Vice President- Investor Relations : Our next question comes from Eli Lustgarten with Longbow Securities (sic) [Research] (30:01). Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC : Good morning, everyone. Can we just get a little more clarification? You just said ag up 23% but you said it's weak. Was that \u2013 and Europe performance has outperformed what the industry, and the industry was down a bit more than it. Is this picking up share? Was this just rebalancing of inventories in ag or something with anticipation of planned shut-downs which are coming this summer? So do you view the ag and the construction more of a one-off quarter as opposed to sustainability and can you talk a little bit about pricing there? Craig Arnold - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Yeah, it's a good question, Eli, and I wish we were really smart enough to be able to call it precisely, but I think it's more the way you articulated. We had a strong quarter of order input in ag and construction. We don't think that's in any way indicative of the underlying market performance, and so it's probably a function of a bit weaker comps that we had last year, and to your point, perhaps some pre-buying that's taking place in anticipation of summer shut-downs. And so that's why our call on the year for Hydraulics hasn't changed. And we still think that the guidance that we provided on the full year is very much consistent with what we're feeling and experiencing in the business. The pricing environment in Hydraulics is just fine. We're not seeing any particular or unusual pressures there with respect to the \u2013 once again, we always talk about it in terms of the net of commodity input costs and price and so we think it will be net about neutral. Price is not going to be a tailwind for us this year, or a headwind. Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC : And just as a follow-up, we're seeing some, a lot more pressure on input costs in the second half of the year, particularly the steel numbers really haven't changed much. They're up big, maybe less than the spot market, but they're still up significantly. Can you talk about cost price across the business? And in the context with the auto numbers that came out that were quite weak today across the board, have you had any concern about some weakness spilling over into Vehicle business besides the truck market, just from North American auto? Craig Arnold - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. As I said, you raise an excellent point, Eli, because we've absolutely seen steel prices move materially up order of magnitude 50%, a lot of that driven by some of the duties that have been put on imports coming out of China, and that's had a knock-on effect of steel prices around the world. In the near term we think we're fine in terms of the net impact to the company. We did some pre-buying. We do have some hedges in place. And so we think in the near term, we have the ability to mitigate the impact of steel price increases. We'll have to wait and see how long these increases stay in effect, whether this is a short-term blip or it's a long-term blip. And in the event that it's a longer term impact, we'd have to actually revisit our pricing assumption and we'd find a way to pass it on into the marketplace. And so, we think once again on balance, we'll do what we've always done in inflationary environments. We'll find a way to pass it on to the customer base. And I think it's been well publicized, it's well understood, and so we don't think that poses a risk to our margins. To your point around auto weakness, we certainly have seen a lot of the reports, reading the same ones that you have. We continue to take a very cautious view on the outlook for automotive markets. We think North America will be largely flat this year and Europe and Asia will be up slightly. But like you, we're taking a very cautious view of it and we're getting prepared that in the event that we do have a downturn, we're going to be well prepared to deal with it. I will add that there's a number of economic forecasters who do have a view that's already out for 2017 and we're not sure if they're right or wrong but whether it's IHS or some of the other economic forecasters, they think that the markets essentially continue at these high levels on into 2017 that essentially look flat or maybe up 1% or so, 1% or 2%. But we're watching it just like you and we'll be prepared in the event that it takes a turn for the worse. Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC : Thank you very much. Donald H. Bullock - Senior Vice President- Investor Relations : Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey. Good morning, guys, and nice job executing in a tough market. My first question, maybe just starting on Hydraulics for a second, I saw that you didn't take down the organic growth guide, yet one of your largest customers talked this quarter about underproducing real demand in the second half of the year. So I'm trying to marry those points. You guys are seeing some stabilization. It seems like things can get a little bit worse. So talk to us a little bit about, like, what you're seeing and what your expectation is for the second half. Craig Arnold - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, and I think generally speaking, I said we were really pleased with our Q2 performance in Hydraulics and as we look at the absolute level of change in revenue for the quarter, down some 7%, slightly better than we anticipated, and you take a look at our order input down some 2%. So we think a couple of really strong data points that would suggest that if there is in fact a little bit of weakness in the back end in certain markets, and we saw the same report that you did that came out of one of our major customers, there's another \u2013 there's enough breadth in the business and other segments that are performing a little bit better than that that on net, we think that the year will be very much in line with what our expectations have laid out. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Fair enough. And I guess maybe my follow-up, one of the things that has surprised us from a trend perspective this quarter was that June seemed to have gotten worse for a lot of our companies, especially on the industrial side. And so to the extent that you maybe can provide some color on what you saw in sequential trends and specifically talk about industrial, that would be helpful. Craig Arnold - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, I think from our perspective, industrial really has been a source of weakness really this year and for the entire quarter. I don't know that June was an especially stand-out month for us in terms of the industrial markets, but we are in fact seeing the same weakness that others are talking about. And it's one of the reasons why in our Industrial Systems and Services (sic) [Electrical Systems and Services] (36:29) business, that we've taken the guidance down and the reason why we continue to see some margin challenges in that business. And so we are absolutely seeing the weakness and experiencing it. I would not say that we saw any particular change in the rate of trajectory in the month of June. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Great. Thanks, guys. Donald H. Bullock - Senior Vice President- Investor Relations : Our next question comes from John Inch with Deutsche Bank. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Hey. How did ESS margins in the backlog, how do they look? And the order pricing, is there anything that you could provide us there, Craig, in terms of color? Craig Arnold - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, I'd say there's nothing in the backlog or environment that will in any way materially change the margin assumptions or are highly influencing our assumptions around margins for the balance of the year. Now we did in fact trim the margin guide to ES&S, but that's largely a function of the things that we talked about. We talked about the fact that large projects, large industrial projects, which tend to be more profitable, we're not selling as many of them. So we have a negative mix effect, and that's the one business where we are seeing a slight negative on the balance between commodity input costs and pricing. And so that was the other reason why we trimmed the guidance slightly in ES&S. But there's really nothing in the backlog that would suggest any particular heavy influence on the margins of the business on a go-forward basis. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: So other \u2013 just by inference then, other companies and not Eaton have called out that what projects are available. And I realize I'm not suggesting it's apples to apples, but just in general, right? What projects are available, but pricing is very tough, as you can imagine, right? Just because of the capacity that's out there for fewer projects. Sounds like that's not happening. Craig Arnold - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : No, and I think what we said is that price in that particular business, the net of price and commodity import prices, that is negative. So we are in fact experiencing a bit of price pressure in our Electrical Systems and Services business. So that would \u2013 we are in fact saying exactly what you're hearing from other companies. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Okay. And then maybe big picture, how was China in the quarter? Maybe you could dovetail a little bit of your commentary around construction and just in general in China, right, was it stable? Did it get better? Did it get worse? Just if you \u2013 anything you can tell us about it would be fantastic, Craig. Craig Arnold - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. I'd say in general what we're seeing in China is largely ongoing weakness. I think as you heard the commentary as I talked through the various end markets, but for let's call it the consumer-related market and passenger car markets, we continue to see weakness, mid-single digit weakness in the industrial markets in China. That's affecting our Electrical business, and we continue to see strong double-digit declines in many of the Hydraulic-related markets as they continue to work off excess inventory. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: I was going to ask you just lastly on inventory in China, I think at the Analyst Meeting earlier this year, there was a broad discussion around just a lot of systemic inventory in China, whether it be construction machines or other equipment. And it's just not Eaton, it's more market. Has that changed at all, do you think? Or is it still this overhang? Craig Arnold - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : So I think we're still living through a bit of overhang, and sales versus production I think continues to eat into the inventory overhang that we're dealing with in a lot of the capital equipment markets. Principally I think markets like excavators and road rollers and the other things that are really supporting this major building boom that China went through over the last ten years, but they continue to eat into it. Are inventories today at the level that I'd say are where the market needs them to be? I'd say no. I think they're still working through a bit of an inventory overhang, and that's why we're still dealing with these strong double-digit declines in a lot of the end markets in China. And that's very much what we're forecasting. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yup. Got it. Thanks very much. Donald H. Bullock - Senior Vice President- Investor Relations : Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks. Good morning. And good solid quarter here. Just wanted to come back to Hydraulics. This quarter, Craig, is the first we've seen any sort of hint of normal seasonality in this business for about three years. So I'm wondering maybe \u2013 obviously the orders down 2% is good news, but it's sometimes hard to define the underlying trend from order data alone. So I'm just wondering maybe address the issue of normal seasonality at lower levels and how did the book-to-bill this quarter compare to other quarters? Are we at a normal book-to-bill ratio here? Craig Arnold - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, I'd say that if we take a look at the business this quarter, we built a little backlog in the quarter, which would be expected to the extent that your orders are stronger than your sales out, and so \u2013 but once again, I think like you, we don't want to over-read one quarter of results in Hydraulics. And so it was a bit of a stronger quarter than we anticipated in the order intake. Is this a turn in the business? We don't know. And I think it's too early to call. I think we need to string together more than one data point before we know whether or not the Hydraulic end markets, the big important markets to this business which are ag and construction and oil and gas and mining, have these markets bottomed out? Are they ready for a turn? We're reading all of the same customer data that you read, which would suggest that we're still living in this period of really low economic activity. So I'd say in general it's just too early to call whether or not these markets have reached bottom and are prepared for a turn. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yeah, but stability is good news, I guess. Craig Arnold - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : (42:24) Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: And then \u2013 yeah. And on the restructuring, clearly you're getting some pretty tangible payback on the actions. You've raised by $5 million this year, you're getting $5 million more, so it's a wash, but 2017 you gave some color in terms of what do you expect, and I'm struggling for the numbers here, but I think it was $130 million of restructuring costs next year and $105 million of payback, incremental payback. Are we still on track for that next year? Craig Arnold - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, well, we're still on track and what we said is $120 million of net, so you think about the net profit improvement as a function of restructuring. We said it's $120 million, but your numbers are largely correct. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks, Craig. Craig Arnold - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : (43:08). Great. Donald H. Bullock - Senior Vice President- Investor Relations : Okay. Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Thank you. Good morning, guys. Hey, just a couple questions. Craig, on lighting, I think you described it as mid-single digit. I don't know if that was an outlook comment for what happened in the quarter. Could you just elaborate on that? And I was wondering if maybe you could bifurcate lighting a little bit. I think you have some harsh and hazardous in there that maybe is holding that business back a little bit. Any way to think about the underlying truly commercial part of lighting and how that's growing, commercial and res? Craig Arnold - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, we did say mid-single digit in my commentary. That's really a reflection of what we expect for the entire year and so it's our outlooks, but it's largely the way we think the market has been performing overall. When we quote the lighting numbers, it does in fact include all of our lighting which would include harsh and hazardous and the safety business as well, so it's a composite view. And certainly, if you took out harsh and hazardous, the business would be performing slightly better. I don't have the exact number handy, but it would certainly be performing slightly better than that. And we think the really important news is that LED penetration continues to grow inside of our overall lighting business and LED penetration in Q2 was approaching 70%. So we continue to see tremendous growth and penetration in LED lighting and we think that has a lot of room to run and we're really pleased with the way that business is performing. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Thanks. And Craig, I appreciate your comment on trying to go after price as laws maybe start to work against you a little bit. But can you help us frame that? Perhaps some idea of what percent of your COGS are raw metals or metal related or any kind of ballpark number you could give us there? Craig Arnold - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, it's not a number I have handy so what I would just say is that what we'll do is we'll find a way to offset it like we have historically. We could end up in any given quarter with a little timing challenge around inflation versus pricing in the market. But all of that thinking and the current commodity prices are factored into our guidance for the year, so it's all fully baked into 2016 at the current activity levels, at the current inflated levels of steel prices. And so I don't really have the number in terms of specifically the steel commodity itself and how much, in terms of bifurcating that from the rest of what we buy. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : And just one other quick one. Just thinking of Eaton Corp. as maybe a window on what industrial companies are thinking. Can you share any view on what you would expect your capital spending to do in 2017? Craig Arnold - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, it's really too early for us to make the call. We haven't even really begun the process of working through our internal plans at this point, so we'll certainly be in a position to give you perhaps a better look at that at the end of Q3. But at this point, it's just too early to call. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : All right. Thank you very much. Donald H. Bullock - Senior Vice President- Investor Relations : The next question comes from Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Hey, good morning, guys. Hey, can you hear me? Donald H. Bullock - Senior Vice President- Investor Relations : Yeah, yeah. We got you, Jeff. Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. Yep, sorry. Okay. So I really wanted to focus on EPG order rates. You went from plus 2 to minus 2 and I just want to understand what caused the delta because that was the one area within Electrical that had been more resilient. Richard H. Fearon - Vice Chairman, Chief Financial & Planning Officer : Well, we don't have that precise Q1 to Q2 comparison, but as Craig pointed out, if you look at order pattern in Electrical Products, it really was the industrial parts. It was those products that are in that segment that go into industrial controls for example, and APAC. Those are the two areas that showed particular weakness. And so without having the precise numbers, I would characterize those areas as being a bit softer than in Q1. Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: And how about just the non-res piece? Richard H. Fearon - Vice Chairman, Chief Financial & Planning Officer : Well, non-res of course goes across both segments and so much of non-res in Electrical Products tends to be in the lighter commercial type areas and that experienced good conditions. And as Craig mentioned, Europe in general, non-res as well as other markets, experienced pretty good conditions in Q2. Q2 orders. Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay, good. And then on slide 11, you gave the quarterly cadence of the restructuring cost. Do you have that similarly for the $190 million in savings? Craig Arnold - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, we don't have it particularly for savings and we haven't provided it other than to say that the savings will generally follow the spending in the business. And maybe to deal maybe the follow-on question, as you think about characterizing the restructuring spending for the back end of the year, I'd say that it's going into the businesses that you would likely expect. And so Electrical Systems and Services will be the recipient of the most money followed by Hydraulics and then Vehicle. And so that's, if you're thinking about modeling where the restructuring spending's going, that's really the way the current numbers line out in terms of where most of the cost will go. Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thanks guys. Donald H. Bullock - Senior Vice President- Investor Relations : Our next question comes from Andy Casey with Wells Fargo. Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thanks a lot. Good morning. Question on cash flow. Your really strong performance the first half, it's running about 40% of your annual operating cash guidance and in most years, it moves around a little bit, but it's usually between 20% and 30% full-year operating cash. And Rick mentioned the opportunity to draw down inventory in the back half. Are there any second half offsets of that inventory drawdown that we should consider? Richard H. Fearon - Vice Chairman, Chief Financial & Planning Officer : None that we're aware of. We think that, given that, as Craig commented, we think sequentially, revenue stays relatively flat going from Q2 to Q3 and Q3 to Q4. That would mean you wouldn't have a need to build working capital to deal with revenue going up. And so we would hope that we would be able to pull down a bit of inventories in that flattish revenue environment. But other than just the normal business characteristics, we wouldn't expect anything else to impact cash flow. Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks, Rick. And if at historical proportion of closer to 40% hold, if full-year guidance ends up being a little bit conservative, what sort of allocation priorities should we consider? Would it be an acceleration of maybe share repo or restructuring or something else? Craig Arnold - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, I'd say that, as we think about the company's capital priorities, I think very much consistent with what we said in New York. And our message all along is that if we think about capital allocation, we say the first priority is to invest in our businesses, to continue to invest to drive organic growth. The second priority was said is in fact to ensure that we continue to maintain a very strong dividend. The third priority we said was to buy back shares, especially in this environment. We think that our stock price is on sale and we think we can create a lot of value of buying back our shares. And then the fourth priority would be to do M&A. And so that prioritization has not changed and that's currently the way we would think about capital deployment. Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you very much. Donald H. Bullock - Senior Vice President- Investor Relations : Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with Buckingham Research. Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Hi. Good morning, guys. Just to come back to Hydraulics and the stationary market, it seems like you guys are trying to signal a bit more of a downbeat tone there, although when you talk about the weakness or the fresh weakness in industrial market, it seems to be directed more at ESS. So I guess I'm trying to determine one, in 2Q did you see a further loss of momentum in stationary or is it just trying to signal that hey, some of the mobile markets are hitting easier comps and stationary is now along for the ride? I guess first question, just trying to parse out that difference. Craig Arnold - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, I'd say in terms of Hydraulics, I think the right way to characterize what we're seeing in the stationary markets is that the oil and gas markets continue to be weak. They've been weak all year and we really have not seen a turn in those markets. We did see a little bit of some weakness in some of the process industries, but those orders tend to be lumpy. And we saw some strength in the mobile markets. And so I'd say the way we'd characterize Hydraulics is that not a downbeat tone at all. We're very much pleased with the fact that we posted better revenue than what we anticipated and we had better order performance than we anticipated. We do think it's important that we don't read that through to mean that a definitive bottom in the business and that the business has turned, but it's certainly a positive indicator for the business overall. Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Got you. And thinking about the potential margin mix of recovery, if mobile starts to look better or bounces off of a bottom here and stationary stays weak, is that a better outlook for the margins of the business? Is it all about the same? Maybe help us try to bridge that gap. Craig Arnold - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, I think the bigger indicator would be what's happening with the OEM business, whether it's mobile or stationary, and what's happening with distribution. The distribution business tends to be a bit more profitable than the OEM business, and that's really more what influenced the underlying profitability than anything else. And in the quarter, our distribution orders were actually slightly stronger than our OE orders. And so that's a positive sign. But once again, with one quarter, really too early to really make a call one way or the other. Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: I guess maybe to ask the question differently, is there more distribution exposure in stationary or mobile? Craig Arnold - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, they really do play across both segments and so our distributors sell mobile applications. They sell industrial applications, so really they play across both markets. Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Okay. Appreciate the question, guys. Craig Arnold - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Sure. Donald H. Bullock - Senior Vice President- Investor Relations : Our next question comes from Shannon O'Callaghan with UBS. Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC : Morning, guys. Hey, on Hydraulics, just on the margin side, getting that back to low teens margins ex restructuring has been a goal of yours. Was this sooner than you expected to get there? And now that you're there, has the 13.1% victory been achieved, or anything particularly favorable that got you there this quarter? Craig Arnold - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, no, I'd say the business largely performed on expectations for the quarter and we certainly continue to have work to do inside of that business with respect to restructuring. We're not done, and obviously the 13% at the low point in the cycle was the bottom of our threshold. And obviously our aspirations for the business are much stronger than that. So I'd say no, we're not done. We're not ready to declare a victory. It was a strong indicator that the restructuring work that we're doing is paying off, but we clearly still have work to do in that business at different volume levels to ensure that we can maintain the minimum of 13% at the bottom of the cycle, and obviously numbers that are closer to 16% in normal times. Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC : Okay, and then on Vehicle, on the margins there, you guys have worked to decapitalize that business and try to minimize the decrementals. They got a little tougher this quarter. You still feel good about the ability to keep modest decrementals in Vehicle? Craig Arnold - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, absolutely. And quite frankly, we're really pleased with the Vehicle business and the way it performed in the quarter. 17.1% return on sales excluding restructuring at a period of time when the North America Class 8 market is down 30%, at a time when the Brazilian markets are at all-time lows. We think that business continues to execute extraordinarily well and we're very much confident that we have the right formula. And to the point that you raised, it has been a formula of decapitalizing the business, changing the business model, moving more across from fixed to variable and we're very much comfortable that the business formula works there and that that business will continue to deliver strong margins in very difficult economic environments. Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC : Okay, thanks. Donald H. Bullock - Senior Vice President- Investor Relations : Our next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Hey, just like to touch on Aerospace if we could, some more specifics on the mix that you saw this quarter. The business jet weakness is certainly being felt industry-wide, but maybe some color on the offsets in the aftermarket, both military and commercial? Craig Arnold - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, as we said, Deane, appreciate the question. I think it's the weakness on the bizjet side caught us all a little bit off guard and that's really what's driving a little bit of underperformance in that business from a revenue and an order input standpoint. But offsetting that and helping the margins, we continue to see strong order input and results in aftermarket, commercial OE, commercial transport continues to be quite strong. It was roughly 10% in the quarter. Military OE was off modestly but very much in line with expectations. And Military aftermarket also growing in the mid-single digit range and so aftermarket continues to be a real source of strength. Commercial transport continues to be a real source of strength offsetting some weakness in bizjet and a little bit of weakness in regional jet as well. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thanks. And then, Craig, just on a bigger picture question, you've now had your first quarter as Chairman and CEO successfully completed. Is there anything different versus your expectations since taking the helm in June? Craig Arnold - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Deane. I appreciate that question as well. I'd really say no. Again, as you know as well, the transition between Sandy and myself was really over a period of about 12 months and during that period of time, we worked closely together and I was in the shadows of all the calls that have taken place over the last year or more. And so I'd say the job is largely what I expected. The business environment is largely what I expected and there's really been no big surprises. It's the way we like it by the way, in the job so far. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Terrific. Appreciate that. Thanks. Operator : Our next question is from Chris Glynn with Oppenheimer. Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thanks. On the guide I think I heard revenue flat or sequentially into the third quarter and again into the fourth quarter. That would seem to be a favorable in the fourth quarter relative to normal seasonality, if you could comment on that. Richard H. Fearon - Vice Chairman, Chief Financial & Planning Officer : It's relatively flat. It might be down just a tiny amount in Q4 possibly, but the reality is that it won't even be a material change and so as we see the balance of the year laying out, it's just Q2, Q3, Q4 are essentially flat revenue. Craig Arnold - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : And I appreciate the concern that a number of you are signaling around the second half volume pace. And what we've said all along is that in the event that the volume pace is any different than what we anticipate, we'll be more aggressive around the things that we will do around managing costs. And so as you can imagine, we have a contingency plan that we're working through as a leadership team around what happens if in fact we end up with a volume issue in the second half of the year. So we're well prepared for that contingency. Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. And then just in lighting I'm wondering if there's been a lot of transition over the last couple years. One of your competitors talked about some recent change in the competitive and pricing environment, are you seeing anything in that area? Craig Arnold - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : No. I'd say lighting, every year it's a business given that the input costs and the price of LEDs has continued to fall. So every year it's a business that basically sheds a bit of price, but also the input costs and the cost of that LED technology continues to drop and so I'd say in that business overall, in its ordinary course is that it's a competitive business and the technology cost continues to decline and our margins in that business, quite frankly are performing just fine. And we had another strong quarter of margins in Q2 and so we think that business is fine and very much consistent with the guidance that we laid out for products during the course of the year. Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thanks. Donald H. Bullock - Senior Vice President- Investor Relations : Thank you all for joining us today. We're at the top of the hour and wrapping, and would like to wrap up our call. As always we'll be available to take questions or follow-up item after the call, thank you very much for joining us today. Operator : And that does conclude the conference for today. Thanks for participation. Craig Arnold - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Operator : You may now disconnect.",

Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Eaton Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all telephone participants will be in a listen-only mode. Later we'll conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. And I'll now turn the conference over to our host, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Don Bullock. Please go ahead, sir. Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: Good morning. I'm Don Bullock, Eaton's Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you to all of you for joining us for Eaton's Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. With me today are Craig Arnold, our Chairman and CEO, and Rick Fearon, our Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer. Our agenda today, as normal, will typically include opening comments by Craig highlighting the company's performance in the quarter and an outlook for the remainder of 2016. As we've done in our past calls, we'll be taking questions at the end of Craig's comments. A couple of quick items before I turn it over to Craig. The press release for today's earnings announcement this morning and the presentation we'll go through have been posted on our website at www.eaton.com. Please note that both the press release and the presentation do contain reconciliations to non-GAAP measures. A webcast of today's call is accessible on our website and it'll be available for replay. Before we get started, I do want to remind you that our comments today do include statements that are related to expected future results. As a result, those are considered as forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ from those for a wide range of uncertainties and risks. All of those are described in the 8-K. With all that, I'll turn it over to Craig. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Thanks, Don. I know that most of you have worked through the earnings release and the details of our earnings already as I've seen a number of your reports already. So what I'll try to do this morning is hit the highlights and then maybe add some color commentary in and around the results. First of all, you noted that EPS did comment at the midpoint of our guidance of $1.15 and we're actually pleased with these results despite revenue coming in weaker than what we expected. We actually delivered strong operating margins at 16% and 16.5% excluding restructuring, largely as a result of better restructuring benefits and good cost control across the company. We had another strong cash quarter. Cash flows were $798 million in the quarter. Our cash conversion ratios in the quarter were 130%, driven by strong margins and the benefits of amortization. Year-to-date, our cash conversion ratio is 110%. We took advantage of our strong cash position and we repurchased 3.7 million shares, $243 million in the quarter, and this brings our full-year repurchases to 9.2 million shares or $560 million versus our target of $700 million for the year. Turning to page 4, the financial summary, as we've said, total revenues in the quarter came in weaker than we expected. If you recall from our earlier guidance, we expected Q3 revenues would be flat with Q2; and organic revenues actually came in down 1%, with less seasonal growth in both of our Electrical segments as well as weaker sales in Aerospace and Vehicle. Revenue is 4% lower than prior year with 3% of that coming from lower organic revenues. We did have strong operating performance, as I mentioned, in the quarter. A couple of points of reference for you. In comparison with Q2, we delivered $20 million more of additional segment operating profits on $93 million of lower revenue and, excluding restructuring costs, the improvement in profit was $7 million on, once again, $93 million of lower revenue. And one more comparison point for you. When you compare with Q3 of 2015, excluding restructuring costs we delivered strong decremental performance. Profits were actually down some $27 million on $216 million of lower revenue, a 12.5% decremental rate. So we continue to think that the businesses are executing extraordinarily well in a tough revenue environment. And as a result, we were able to deliver a small improvement in segment margins despite the decline in revenues. In turning our attention to the segments, we'll begin with Electrical Products. Here our revenues were flat year-on-year but down 1% versus Q2, largely on currency and continued weakness in our industrial markets. Areas of strength included LED lighting, up mid-double digits with LED sales now accounting for 68% of our total lighting revenue. Residential Construction was up mid-single digits year on year as well. And a key area of weakness here really continues to be industrial controls and the components that we make in our Electrical Products business and actually sell to the assembly side of our house. So really a continuation of the trends that we've seen all year. Margins continue to be strong at 18.8%. And if you take a look at bookings, bookings were down 1% in the quarter, a little better than last quarter where we were down 2%, but certainly not up to the expectation that we had, with strength in Lighting in residential markets, strength in the Middle East, Western Europe and continued weakness, as I noted, in Industrial Controls. In Electrical Systems and Services, revenues in the quarter were down 3%, 2% organically versus Q3 of 2015 and essentially flat sequentially from Q2. You will recall that in Q2 our bookings were down 2%, so we've clearly seen a bit of deterioration in this segment as bookings were down 5% in Q3, driven by once again a continuation of the pattern that we've seen all year, continued weakness in industrial projects in oil and gas offset by some strength in U.S. light commercial markets, Asia-Pacific, Northern Europe. But clearly these areas of strength were not large enough to offset the declines in the other markets. Margins were 14.2% excluding restructuring costs, and up from both prior year and Q2, really reflecting the benefits of the restructuring work that's going on across the company and in this segment. In the Hydraulics segment revenues were down 6% from prior year and down 5% from Q2. This Q2 to Q3 change is seasonality and is really consistent with prior years, so not at all unexpected. Q3 revenue shows about equal weakness in both OEM and distribution. And within the OEM channels, stationary was down more than the mobile side of the business, largely as a result of the ongoing weakness in the oil and gas market. Bookings declined 3% in the quarter, very similar to the levels that we've seen in Q2, which were down 2%. But here we do see some differences between OEM and distribution, with OEM orders up 2% and distribution orders down 8%. We're once again very pleased with our margins, which came in at 10.9% and 12.6% excluding restructuring. In Aerospace, revenues were flat organically and down 3% excluding FX. And the FX impact was entirely the result of the lower British pound. Revenues were down 2% from Q2 and down 1% organically from Q2. Encouragingly, we once again saw very strong margins, which were 20% in our Aerospace segment, and also strong quarterly bookings. Bookings were up some 15% in the quarter with continued strength in both Commercial and Military OEM, partially offset by continued weakness in business and regional jet activity. Aftermarket bookings were also up 5% in the quarter, with particular strength on the commercial side. And in the Vehicle segment, revenues were down 12% year on year, driven principally by the large decline that we're seeing in the NAFTA heavy-duty truck market. Production was down some 35% in Q3. Revenues were also down 5% versus Q2. So we now expect the NAFTA heavy-duty truck production to be approximately 225,000 units this year versus our prior thinking of 230,000 units. Passenger vehicle sales in the quarter remained strong with particular strength in China and modest strength in Europe. And margins, while certainly below prior year, remain at attractive levels at 15.5% and 16.2% excluding restructuring. If we take a look at the balance of the year, what we're really seeing here is industrial weakness, and industrial weakness that is continuing. And so we now have updated our overall revenue forecast to be down 4% for the year, and so we're really thinking that the year now comes in at the lower end of our guidance. And as you'll note from the chart on page 10, we did in fact make a number of meaningful adjustments to our full-year outlook. And I'll walk you through some of the detail here and some of the drivers. First, in Electrical Products, we took the midpoint of our guidance down 1.5 points. And this is really principally due to additional weakness in industrial components and industrial products such as fuses and structural support products, and as well as some softness in some particular geographies, notably in the Middle East and Canada. In Electrical Systems and Services, some tuning here, we took our guidance down 0.5 basis points and this is principally a result of continued weakness in the oil and gas projects, including the Middle East; and then large industrial project activity slowed even more than what we anticipated in the quarter. In Hydraulics, the one segment where we're actually taking our revenue guidance up for the year, up 1.5 points. And this is largely as a result of what we're seeing as stabilization in China and what we think is a bit of an inventory correction that's taking place in some of our customers in some of our markets. In Aerospace, we took the guidance down 1.5 points, and this is largely as a result of ongoing weakness in business and regional jets and lower military spending. And then lastly, in Vehicle, a couple of point reduction in our guidance for the year, and this is 100% a result of the ongoing weakness that we're seeing in the heavy-duty truck market and the reduction in the market from 230,000 to 225,000 units. And that'll cascades through to the company's revenue being down some 1% from prior guidance. If we turn our attention to page 11, restructuring, we're pleased to report that restructuring plan is going well. Costs are essentially coming in at planned levels at $145 million. We spent some $23 million in Q3 versus our original expectation of spending $27 million. And this is largely due to some timing. And we think at this point Q4 will be $24 million versus our previous guidance of $20 million, so a little bit of a flip between the quarters. We are, in fact, seeing benefits coming in slightly better than what we anticipated at $200 million for the year versus our previous guide of $190 million, and we saw these benefits largely come through in Q3. And a result of that is, clearly, we're updating our segment margin expectations for the year as well. And as a result of lower revenue and the decremental on that and a slightly different mix of restructuring in some of the businesses, we're also updating our full year forecast for segment margins. For Eaton overall, as you can see on this chart, it results in a 40 basis point reduction in operating margins versus our prior guidance. And then, if you just look at the different businesses, quickly I'll walk through them, Electrical Products, up slightly, basically on expectation, and Electrical Systems and Services, a 30 basis point reduction. And that's essentially decremental on the change in revenue. In Hydraulics, two things going on here, actually. One is higher restructuring costs in our Hydraulics business than we originally planned. And then, secondly, a little bit of a mix issue in terms of the mix between the OEM channel and the distribution channel that's playing through. And as I think most of you're aware, margins tend to be higher in the distribution channel than in the OEM channel. And in Aerospace, we're taking our margins up for the year, a 90 basis point increase, and two things really driving this change. One is timing on program spending. Program costs, as you know, tend to be lumpy over time, and then a little bit lower restructuring costs in Aerospace. And then lastly, in Vehicle, it's principally a function of lower volume and mix as most of the volume reduction is coming in the North America heavy-duty Class 8 market, which tends to be a little bit more profitable than the rest of the business overall. And so, once again, that'll cascade through to a 40 basis point reduction. If we take a look at our guidance and the outlook for Q4, as we reported, we now expect revenues to be down 1.5 points from Q3. We expect margins will be between 15.4% and 15.8%, driven largely by, once again, lower volumes and unfavorable mix, growth in lighting and some weakness in industrial controls and large industrial projects, and continued weakness in oil and gas. And we're reducing our Q4 guidance by $0.10 at the midpoint, with a range of $1.05 to $1.15. We expect our tax rates will be between 9% and 10% in Q4. And as we said earlier, for the full year, the updated revenue forecast is that organic growth will now be down 4%. And this $0.10 reduction in Q4 EPS amounts to about a 2% reduction in our EPS for the year and drives the change in the midpoint of our guidance, as reported. So in summary, the chart that we always provide is a summary of kind of the key assumptions for the year laid out on the chart on page 14. You can see the assumption on the revenue change. Corporate costs are now forecasted to come in at $90 million below 2015 levels versus the previous guidance of $80 million, so a little bit better cost control and a little bit better benefits in restructuring. And our full year tax rate is now expected to be between 9% and 10% versus the previous guidance of between 9% and 11%. And you can see the EPS forecast we talked about. And cash flow guidance unchanged. So while we're seeing a little bit lower profits, this is offset by better working capital management. So just stepping back from the year and a summary of Q3, we see this period of general weakness in industrial markets continuing. Despite this weakness we think that our team delivered solid results in Q3. This order weakness, however, that we saw in Q3 is reflected in our Q4 forecast, where we see EPS will be $0.05 below Q3 and $0.10 below our full-year guidance. These changes are obviously cascading through, but we do expect to maintain our guidance on cash flow and share repurchase for the year. Our initial thoughts and a look at 2017, I'd say while it's difficult to make a call on 2017, we do think this period of market uncertainty and caution on capital spending will extend into 2017. We're clearly dealing with a bit of a two-speed economy where the consumer side of the markets continue to do well, but industrial markets continue to be weak and uncertain at best. So in response, as you noted in our earnings release, we're expanding our restructuring program by $50 million in 2017 to $180 million total. Other areas where we're likely to face a bit of a headwind for 2017, our pension plan discount rate will likely be lower by 25 to 40 basis points. The 2016 discount rate was 4.25%. And the way to think about this is for every 25 basis points decline in the discount rate, it results in a $20 million increase in annual pension expense. We're likely to see slightly higher interest expense in 2017. LIBOR has risen, and as a result, changes in money market regulations, and this increases the cost of our floating-rate debt. We'll also potentially have some transitional interest expense related to refinancing some debt in 2017. And then we do expect a slightly higher tax rate as well next year. We certainly remain on track to generate very strong cash flow, and we expect cash conversion in 2017 to continue to be above 100%. And this will certainly allow us to stay on track with the share repurchase program that we've announced and to deliver the targets that we've laid out. This concludes my prepared remarks. And I'll turn it back to Don at this point. Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: Our operator will give you instructions for those of you who are going to be posing questions. Operator : Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: Our first question comes from Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good morning. So just as a quick clarification on some of the 2017 commentary, Craig, the $120 million of incremental profit, I'm assuming that's segment profits inclusive of restructuring, so inclusive of that increase in the restructuring. Is that correct? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: That is correct, Nigel, so we're obviously increasing our restructuring expenses by $50 million, but we expect to see benefits in the year that will offset that additional spending. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And I'm assuming that there's some underlying sales assumption that's forming the basis of that $120 million. Maybe you could share that with us as well, Craig? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: I think at this point, Nigel, all we'd really say about 2017 is that Q3 was certainly a bit of a disappointment when we took a look at a lot of our end markets and our order intake, and we expect that to continue into Q4. And we're in such a period of uncertainty right now, with so much volatility in many of our end markets that it really is difficult to make a call on 2017. And so we made the decision to increase our restructuring, because we think this period of uncertainty will continue. But we do think it's too early to make a call on what our revenues will be next year. I think once we get past the elections and a little bit of the uncertainty works its way through, we'll be in a better position to make a call on revenue next year. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. I have just a quick follow on that. So the $120 million, I'm just wondering what are the boundaries on sales that you feel comfortable with that range, because obviously there's a point by which you can't get that number. So I'm just wondering what the boundaries are around that connection to protect that range. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: I think the restructuring benefits are largely a function of taking out fixed costs, support costs, and really are not in any way a function of revenue. And so those benefits are essentially independent of revenue. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. I'll leave it there. Thanks. Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: Our next question comes from Ann Duignan with JPMorgan. Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Hi. Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Can you talk a little bit about your Aerospace outlook and the margins for 2016? Should we think about that as just the deferral of spending that will come back in 2017 so we don't take Q4 margins as a run rate into 2017? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yeah, and I think that's absolutely the right way to think about it. As you know this business especially well, that the program spending tends to be quite lumpy, and you can have periods where your spending go up, periods where your programs are deferred and it comes down. And so I do think \u2013 great performance by our team operationally so we don't want to take anything away from the strong performance but, certainly, a piece of this is a function of lower program spending that will come back next year. Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And I appreciate that. And then could you just comment on the Q4 guidance? Where did you get the biggest surprise across the businesses? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yeah, what I'd say, Ann, really throughout the summer months, we principally saw a weakness across most of our Electrical end markets. If you think about the markets that have been weak all along whether it's oil and gas or whether it's large industrial projects, industrial controls, we saw each of those markets essentially weaken up a little bit throughout the summer months, and that certainly cascaded through to the order input that we saw in our Electrical Systems and Services business, which, as we reported, was down 5%. And so we saw clearly weakness there. We saw additional weakness in the North America Class 8 truck market, and that's what resulted in us reducing our forecast for that market to 225,000 units, but those are the places where we principally saw the reductions. It was really pretty broad across many of the Electrical end markets, as well as the North America Class 8 truck business. Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And just quickly as a clarification on the weakness in the large industrial controls, is that related to the slowdown in investment in manufacturing, you know, LNG petrochemicals? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: You're absolutely right, and you see the C30 data just as well as we do in terms of the government data, the put in place numbers, and almost every category with the exception of health care and commercial went negative in Q3. And so you're absolutely right that across all of those end markets we saw weakening this summer. Question \u2013 is that a function of all the uncertainty in the current environment? In manufacturing capital equipment, everybody's taking a pause until the air clears a little bit here around which way the U.S. is headed, but it was principally in the U.S. that we saw the weakness and really across most of those markets. Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. I'll get back in queue, and then I'll root for the Indians. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yes. Thank you. Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thanks a lot. Craig, I guess I just wanted to follow up on something that you mentioned at the end of your prepared remarks about confidence in hitting targets. So if you look at 2017 overall, does that mean that you're still reasonably confident of that 8% to 9% EPS CAGR target that you laid out in February? Or you are referring to something else? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yeah, I mean, the 8% to 9% EPS CAGR was really over a five-year period, and so there's nothing that we've seen in this kind of temporary pause that we're seeing a lot of our end markets at in any way takes away from our confidence in delivering the longer-term EPS improvement that we laid out. I think there really is a question around 2017 with respect to where some of these end markets are headed, and, quite frankly, we were surprised and disappointed with our bookings and the way a lot of the end markets kind of played out in Q3. Question \u2013 is that a temporary pause or does that play through more thoroughly into 2017? We just think it's too early to make a call. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Understood. And then on Electrical Systems and Service, profits in dollars and also the margin percentage, it's on track to fall for the third year in a row. Orders are soft, so the revenue line probably can't turn around until mid next year at the earliest. How should we think about the approach in that business aside from just cost-cutting? Is there anything more proactive you can do in terms of project selectivity, change the end market focus, exit certain business lines or something? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yeah, I'd say in Electrical Systems and Services specifically, as you're aware, we are in fact undertaking a fairly significant amount of restructuring in that business. And so if you take a look at our margins in Q3, without restructuring, at 14.2%, we do see improvement in the underlying margins of that business. To your point around growth, in terms of this, certainly this is the business that is most closely tied to infrastructure spending, large projects, and so it is very difficult in the near-term to fundamentally delink this business or really any of our businesses from the secular trends that are taking place in these large end markets. Having said that, we have lots of growth initiatives that we're focused on in every one of our businesses, and Electrical Systems and Services included. So today, I'd say that in the short term it's going to be very difficult to fundamentally perform significantly different than the end markets that that business serves. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Very helpful. Thank you. Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: Our next question comes from Steve Winoker with Bernstein. Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thanks, and good morning, all. Let's get a little more detail around the restructuring actions. First, just the 3Q to 4Q shift, maybe just a little color on what was driving the shift? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: We had a $4 million shift between the quarters, as you'll note and as we talked about. In Q3 we actually delivered $10 million more benefits than what we forecasted. So the program is very much on track, and we're very happy and pleased with the way our teams are executing. But as you think about restructuring programs of this magnitude, there can always be timing associated with a number of the decisions that you make, negotiations that have to take place in some cases with work councils and unions around the world. So I would just say it's a small adjustment of timing of spending between the quarters but nothing to be concerned about. Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: And while there's always pro-restructuring programs to find across a large, complex organization, these are some big step-ups. What kinds of programs are you tapping into now when you do things like all of a sudden put another $50 million on the table for next year? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: And the way we would think about it, by the way, is it's really not all of a sudden, because as we've talked about in prior calls, our businesses today have a healthy backlog of opportunities to restructure. And so we are always working on a pipeline of opportunities that our businesses are advocating for, that make sense, and it's really a matter of metering these programs in, given the organization's capability of digesting all of the restructuring that's undergoing. And so today, the programs themselves, it's really more of the same. And we talked about looking at structural costs inside of our businesses, looking at management layers, span of control, taking out fixed costs, looking at the manufacturing footprint that we have around the world. So it's very much in line with the type of restructuring programs that we've done historically, which is why, quite frankly, you see a very strong payback on the program that we've announced. And so it's very much consistent with what we've done in the past. Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Is the footprint a big \u2013 a very large part of this one? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yeah, I'd say it's a mix. It's always a mixture of some footprint-related changes as well as some structural support cost-related changes, but I will tell you in all cases, it is structural costs, the type of costs that don't come back as volumes change. Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: And just one other one, on the tax. The quote or the comment around the slight tax rate increase for 2017, any color there as you sort of think about the longer-term tax rate also? Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yeah, I'll handle that, Steve. We think the rate between 2016 and 2017 is likely to go up probably a point. Now, that's a very early estimate because it obviously depends on the precise mix, so I don't have a profit plan to look at. So I'm operating with some high-level assumptions. Going forward, it probably continues to go up on the neighborhood of perhaps a point a year, not more than that. And we'll have a further, more fulsome description of the medium-term outlook when we give our formal guidance for 2017. Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay, thanks, Rick. Thanks, Craig. Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: Our next question comes from John Inch with Deutsche Bank. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Morning, John. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi, guys. Hey, Craig, can I pick up please on the whole restructuring context? And I look back and it seems like Eaton has been doing, at least in this cycle, outsized restructuring since the second quarter of 2014. I realize that was before you became CEO, but now that you are CEO, help us understand why is there all of this sort of runway and restructuring? Like why don't you start \u2013 like why do you have so much to do? Why don't you start cutting into bone versus sort of the fat? I guess that's \u2013 help us just understand why this continues? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: I'd say, John, one of the principal issues is if you take a look at the size of the company today versus what we had forecasted, let's say, going back in the last strategic planning period, Eaton is a smaller company. A lot of our end markets over this period of time did not perform anywhere close to what our expectations were. So there's a piece of what we're doing that's essentially rightsizing our company, given the current revenue and the certain size of commercial and economic activity across our enterprise. And having said that, as you're well aware as well, we built this company for the most part through a series of acquisitions. And when you acquire companies, you always acquire excess capacity in manufacturing. And if you'd said, do you have the ideal footprint, if you could start from a clean sheet of paper and redraw it, you never end up in that place if you grow a company through acquisition. And so we're really taking some steps back and saying, what can we do, what would we do if we could start with a clean sheet of paper? How would we draw it up? And from that are coming new ideas and opportunities to do it smarter, to do it better, to do it more efficiently. And so we think we're encouraged by the fact that our businesses have a lot of ideas and a lot of recommendations around things that we can do to continue to improve our margins, despite the fact that we're working in really tough operating conditions. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Is the nature of this stuff, kind of going forward, is it still a people question, or is it more of kind of like a tooling, efficiency, productive ops argument? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Really, it's about at some point in terms of kind of the support cost infrastructure around our business, we'll run out of runway there. Today, we haven't, but at some point we will. But I'd say if you look at, let's say, the manufacturing footprint around the company around the world, I think we'll have opportunities for the foreseeable future to continue to fine-tune the footprint, to fine-tune the way we serve the market. And so I think that it'll be a base level of restructuring. And what we said historically, it's a number that's order of magnitude around $60 million that will always be resident inside of our company. And so we're not even close to running out of ideas at this point around things that we can do to improve the efficiency of the organization. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: And actually, it's appreciated that you actually include it in your results. Could we shift gears just for a second, you guys \u2013 you have sort of on the front line of a lot of construction markets. I know you get access to the NEMA data and so forth. What do you make of \u2013 and then, Craig, you called out light commercial markets in the U.S., I guess, or at least your results doing better, right? What do you make of this choppy non-resi data? And some people have asserted that maybe non-resi markets have peaked or passed the peak. How do you think about that in the context of the markets you serve and your own runway? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: I think it's been tough to get a clear read. And that's why perhaps you're seeing so many conflicting data points and so many companies commenting on different signals. And today, as I mentioned, the C30 report is a good proxy, the NEMA data is a good proxy. And the NEMA data was pretty much consistent with what we saw in the C30 report. We saw weakening in many of the non-resi end markets in Q3. And that's really what's played into a lot of our thinking around Q4 and perhaps playing into 2017. So we still see, if you think about a walkthrough markets, we think the industrial piece, the manufacturing sector, things that have to do with capital spending, continue to be weak. And we see those markets to be down kind of low to mid single-digit this year. Now, oil and gas continues to be weak? Yep, the rig count has increased, but we've not yet seen any of that play through to any strength in oil and gas. In fact, the data was a little bit weaker in Q3 than it had been year-to-date. And so we continue to see weakness on the industrial side of the house, but, having said that, we're seeing strength on the consumer side. Residential housing, the lighting market continues to do well, the Vehicle markets around the world continue to perform well, the light end of non-resi construction, things that are really the small strip malls and really that are, I'd say, almost attached to household formations. So it really depends upon what part of the economy you're serving, and there's pockets of strength and then there's pockets of weakness, and unfortunately today, the weakness is slightly outweighing the positives. But it really is two different pictures depending upon which part of the economy you're sitting on and I know your question is, where is it headed? Which direction is it pointed towards? And at this point I'd say it's a very confusing picture. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: What about, lastly, China? I mean, you're seeing some stability. Other companies have called this out as well. Do you think this is a function of their prior stimulus or do you actually think that there is more sort of enduring demand that may start to kind of go on here despite the fact that you've got all this overbuilding in these property markets? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Sure. Yeah, we too have seen the strength that other companies have talked about in China. We had a pretty strong Q3 overall in terms of our order bookings in China and we saw that in our Hydraulics business. We saw that in our Electrical business as well. So certainly, the government stimulus programs are helping. Their monetary policy is helping. Whether or not these structural improvements will continue into the future, I think it's once again another one of these points of uncertainty. And they put the stimulus programs in effect for a reason. So they had some underlying concerns. But at this point we think China has certainly stabilized. I think the risk associated with China today is less than what it was probably the last time we had a conversation about China last quarter. So we're feeling better about China but longer-term I think it remains a question mark. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got it. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Thanks very much. Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc: Appreciate it. Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: Our next question comes from Jeff Hammond with KeyBank. Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Hey. Good morning, guys. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Howdy. Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Hey. So just as I kind of go through the math of what you laid out on \u2013 you called out the decrementals and they were very good, but if you kind of back out the restructuring, both Cooper and the savings you got, the, I guess, underlying decrementals are pretty heavy, and specifically within Vehicle, I think that was an area you called out where you'd be more resilient. So maybe just speak, when you look at just the normal underlying decrementals, are you seeing \u2013 is it just the magnitude of the decline? Is it pricing pressure? What's contributing to some of that headwind? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: I think, Jeff, overall we are that pleased with the decrementals that we're seeing in all of our businesses. And I think what we've laid out externally is that we say 35% decremental is typically what we would run across the company, and obviously that will vary slightly or in some cases widely depending upon which part of the company you're referring to. And so we're very comfortable with the decrementals that we're seeing in our businesses and we're not particularly seeing any net negative pressure between cost and price, so there aren't any particular unusual pressures there that weren't part of our plan and that we're not dealing with. Specifically in Vehicle, and as I mentioned, we're seeing a reduction in the North America heavy duty Class 8 market, which tends to be the more profitable piece of our Vehicle business. But having said that, our margins in Q3 were 15.5% in an environment where the markets are down some 35% in North America Class 8. Excluding restructuring, margins were 16.2%. So we think that's, quite frankly, very strong performance in a period of time when markets are off as much as they are. Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. And then can you give us a little more color on what you're seeing currently and prospectively in power quality and utility? I don't think you called either of those out within. And then I'm also going to be rooting for the Indians tonight. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: We all are. In fact, we'll be there. So in power quality overall, I'd say we're seeing markets that are essentially flat to up low single digit for the most part. The data center market, the three-phase market we think is performing largely flat for the year, so no big differences there in terms of what we originally anticipated for the year. It varies slightly depending upon what region of the world that you're in, but for the most part we're seeing those markets to be anywhere from flat to up low single digits. Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc: And I'd say the same for utility, too. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yeah, and utilities. Yes. Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc: I think that's part of your question, flat to up low single digits. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Right. And our prior guidance was essentially to be up 0% to 2%, and essentially we're running right at those levels. Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thanks, guys. Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Craig, in passing, you just mentioned no significant price cost disconnects but can you give us a little bit of a forward look on what you see developing there? It would seem there are some cost pressures on the horizon. Are you able to take some price actions to counteract that? And what should we expect going forward? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yeah, I think the way we have approached the whole price versus input cost historically is that we see it for the company as being kind of a net neutral. In periods where we're seeing inflation, we're able to pass price on to the marketplace; and in periods where commodity prices are coming down we tend to shed a little price consistent with the deflation that we're experiencing in the company. As we've said in prior calls, we have a little bit of pressure in Electrical Systems and Services in pricing, but I'd say that's kind of built into the run rate of the business at this point. And so as we think about on a go-forward basis, we don't think anything has changed and the way I would encourage you to think about price versus cost is that it's a net neutral for the company. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Thanks. And then just on thinking about cash and cash flow looking forward, maybe a question for Rick, but the cash conversion very strong this year, clearly some inventory liquidations and the like. But I'm just wondering if you kind of roll it up into next year, perhaps you had pension funding, cash taxes move around. Any early read you can give us on any of those big levers or a high-level view of what cash conversion should look like next year? Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc: We have not done our detailed cash planning, of course, for next year given that we don't even have a profit plan in place but I would tell you that given just the size of our depreciation and amortization, and we would not anticipate any significant pension contributions at this point. We should be solidly above 100%. I don't know exactly how much above 100%, but that would be my anticipation right now. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Okay, and just quickly, you mentioned, Craig, that inventory correction in Hydraulics. I take that to mean an inventory correction going the other way, a rebuild or a restock? Is that what you were implying? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yeah, exactly. A number of our customers had really drawn down inventory pretty significantly. So we think there was some restocking that took place in Q3 and it certainly helped with our total outlook for the year. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Great. Thank you. Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: Our next question comes from Eli Lustgarten with Longbow. Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC : Good morning, everyone. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Hi Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC : Hi. Just one clarification on all the restructuring and it's a very simple clarification. Is the bulk of this thing a permanent stepdown of cost, or is there a portion that if volume starts to come back you'd have to add back? I mean, very often it's a 40% permanent and 60% addback or so. Can we assume that this is much higher than that or ...? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yeah, and I'd be hesitant, Eli, to call it 100% but it's close to 100% permanent stepdown. This is really taking out structural costs that we do not anticipate coming back as volume changes. Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC : Can we talk about typically two markets. One, Aerospace is still positive but it's been disappointing in volume for across the board. Aerospace, you should have some visibility into 2017, so are we looking for this flat to slightly upmarket to continue or does the pushback from this should get pushed into next year? And can you do the same thing in the Hydraulics markets, should it improve with this restocking, does that continue, which means you can get to some positive gains in Hydraulics next year? Or is the general forecast basically a flattish kind of market year over year? Is that sort of what you're looking at as you look to 2017 based on the restocking that we're looking at? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yeah, Eli, I appreciate the question. It's kind of the piece that we're working through right now with respect to what the 2017 outlook is going to look like for the company and for our individual businesses. And I'd say at this juncture we would prefer to defer that question given a number of mixed signals that we saw coming through the dataset in Q3. I will say that the general trends around strength in commercial side of Aerospace and the backlog that Boeing and Airbus has, there's nothing that would suggest that that doesn't continue to be a strength, and consumers continue to get on planes and fly, and revenue passenger miles were, quite frankly, quite strong throughout Q3, growing at 4% in both Europe in the U.S. and almost 8% in Asia. So that piece of the business feels like it's holding up pretty well. We continue to see weakness on the military side. So we'd really prefer to defer that in terms of our thinking on how all those pieces are going to come together, but it's pretty much playing out as expected, other than, as we've noted in Aerospace, we saw much greater weakness in business-jet and regional jet than we anticipated. We and others in the industry, quite frankly. And so that's the piece that a little bit fell out of bed on us this year in the Aerospace market. In Hydraulics, I'd say once again a lot of mixed data. You follow all the same customer sets that we follow, and you see some of the big construction equipment guys, and it doesn't look like things are getting better. They too are serving a lot of the industrial markets that are a function of capital spending. And those markets throughout Q3 look like perhaps maybe we're bouncing along a bottom here, but tough to call a turn in Hydraulics markets at this point as well. And so we hope to learn more as we come through Q4, but at this point I think in Hydraulics for certain it's tough to say that we've see the turn in the market and that we can begin to count on the markets turning positive. Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC : One final question, there was a whole flurry of data center orders in the third quarter reported over the next couple of years. Is that figured into your thinking or being figured? Is that sort of supporting as the market as we begin to look out into 2017 and 2018? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yeah, I think the world continues to consume and generate more and more data. And that's certainly very positive for datacenter markets. And we're seeing that strength play through our business as well. So I do think that's more of a 2017 tailwind as we think about the datacenter market overall and specifically, the three-phase part of datacenters. Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc: And that was particularly strong in the hyperscale centers, very large centers that the web services type folks are putting in. And I think to Craig's point, that will continue simply because of the strong growth in data traffic. Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC : All right. Thank you very much. Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: Next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to go back to 4Q guidance if we could, and maybe it's hard to get too precise here, but can you share your assumptions of what sort of seasonal lift you're expecting in the fourth quarter? We've heard from a number of companies this earnings season saying they're not factoring in any sequential seasonal lift, and maybe some \u2013 would be helpful to hear your thoughts there? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: I think we would be very much and solidly in that camp. And in fact what we've said is that we think that our Q4 revenues will actually be down 1.5%, a point and a half from Q3. So in fact, given the order data that we saw coming out of Q3, we're actually taking our Q4 revenues down slightly from Q3 levels. And that's pretty much across the board. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. That's helpful. And then, any commentary on what you're seeing in lighting? And is there a mix between the two-speed economy, residential-related and commercial-industrial? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Lighting continues to perform well. Our business \u2013 and we think the market is up mid single-digit this year. And we continue to see a real positive performance in the LED piece of lighting, which as I mentioned, is continues to grow at double-digits, now accounts for 68% of the total business. And so lighting continues to be a bright spot. It's certainly a bright spot on the residential side of the house as well as in light commercial. And overall, they too are experiencing some of this weakness on the industrial part of lighting, but that's being overcome and offset by strength in other parts of the business. So lighting continues to be, we think, a positive growth factor as we go forward. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thanks. I'll let you get away with that bright spot pun. Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: Our next question comes from Chris Glynn with Oppenheimer. Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thanks. Good morning. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Hi. Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): So just looking at the $180 million restructuring budget for next year, I would assume that it'd be kind of first half-weighted and maybe ESS heavy, but could you kind of help me compartmentalize those thoughts a little bit? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yeah. We haven't laid out that level of precision yet exactly where all the dollars will flow, but I think it would be fair to say that those businesses that are struggling with weak markets will get more than their fair share of that restructuring dollars. And as you noted, we tend to do these things where it is Q1 heavy, so you could and should expect a big portion of that spending to come early in the year. Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: But we should be in a position, perhaps with Q4 guidance call, to give you more color on exactly the way to calendarize the spending. Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Yeah. That's helpful. I was just looking for a way to do better than prorating, really. And then the linearity question might be moot, because you've repeatedly talked about volatility and almost chaotic trends out there. But did August show particularly weak by any chance? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: What I would say that as we think about Q3 overall, we saw weakness in Q3, not necessarily big discernible patterns across the quarter. So it was a weak quarter of order input, as you can see in our total order intake. And I would not say that we saw significantly different patterns between the months. Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Thanks a lot. Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: Our next question comes from Andy Casey with Wells Fargo. Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Back on that last question, if I can do a follow-up, the no discernible pattern by month, we're a month into the fourth quarter. Is there any color you can give? Is it just the same that you saw in the third quarter? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: I'd say that we just concluded October, so we don't have all the details for the month of October yet, Andy, but I will say that, in general, the early indication would suggest that what we saw in October is very much consistent with what our expectations were for Q4. Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks, Craig. And then if we could go back to the U.S. non-resi construction question and ask it a little bit differently, your Electrical business multichannel sales approach should give you a pretty broad view on concept through project completion. I'm just wondering based on the feedback that you've heard from primarily the Electrical businesses, are you seeing any pullback in the planning pipeline? Or is the overall weakness that you discussed mainly a project start deferral issue? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yeah. I think it's much more the latter in terms of project start deferral issue that more than there is negotiations and things that are in the planning stages. It's companies finding the courage to make the commitment in this volatile and uncertain environment to actually go forward with some of these larger projects. Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks, Craig. And then one last one on the Vehicle, you called out the weakness in Class 8. I'm wondering if you're seeing what we're seeing from like Ford or other OEMs some cutback on the light vehicle side. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yeah, I'd say so far the light vehicle markets have held up extraordinarily well. North America running flat at very high levels; China continuing to run very strongly at high-single-digit numbers; Europe doing better than what we imagined. So I'd say at this juncture, the light vehicle markets around the world, speaking about it globally, are actually holding up quite well. The one piece of caution in North America, we do see the incentives are increasing. And if you take a look at the incentives in Q3, they were up over Q2, and that always gives you a moment of pause or caution, but overall we think light vehicle markets globally are doing just fine. Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you very much. Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: The next question comes Mig Dobre with Baird. Mig Dobre - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thanks for squeezing me in. Just kind of a low-level question for me, I guess. I'm wondering if you can comment at all on any incentive comp changes that happened this year given the adjustment in guidance? And how those might be reset as a potential headwind into 2017? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yeah, I'd say that our year is not done yet, so we've not made the final call on what our incentive comp will be. Our incentive comp plan does flex to the extent that the management team doesn't deliver the committed EPS guidance and commitments, our plans naturally flex. And so it would be reasonable to assume that it will be less than 100% year consistent with the results that we're seeing in the business. And so that, too, will be a little bit of a headwind as we look at 2017; but at this point, we've not made the final call on the incentive comp plan for 2016. Mig Dobre - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay, and then maybe going back to the Vehicle business and a question on auto. Is it fair to assume that your restructuring thus far has really not impacted the light vehicle portion of your segment? And is this something that might be on the table for next year? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yeah, we're just not in the position at this point to make any specific announcements around the restructuring plans until we work those plans through internally and communicate them fully with our employees, we're just not in a position to comment on that. Mig Dobre - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): All right. Thanks. Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with Buckingham Research. Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Hi. Good morning, guys. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Hi. Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Just to follow up on some of the earlier questions on non-res and specifically the industrial side of the air pocket that you've seen most recently. Craig, can you give any more color on what fresh observations your customers are making that want to defer? I mean we've been in a very slow CapEx environment for, call it, two plus years now. Oil and gas, I think, has shouldered a good amount of the blame for the past year at least, and I get that that's a longer cycle business in some cases so maybe there are still backlogged projects that are bleeding off, but it does seem like the tone from yourselves and a lot of your peers out there is that 3Q took another step down but the drivers seem to be unchanged versus what we've seen from past quarters. So just maybe some calibration on what's really new here, and is this an election hiccup or anything else that they would point to that would be fresh? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: And I'd say once again, we're struggling with the data feeds very much like others, but we do think the thematic message that cuts through all these conversations is uncertainty, and if you think about any person running a business today and making a long-term capital commitment in the face of an economic environment and a presidential election that's been as noisy as this one with as much uncertainty around the environment that we're going to be dealing in, it's, while disappointing, a little bit understandable that companies are basically pausing and waiting to see how things play out before they make a decision around major capital multi-year commitments. And so we think that's probably what's going on. But once again, we're not 100% certain either. What we do here pretty consistently is that it's a pretty uncertain period of time that we're dealing in and most companies or many companies are cutting their capital budgets and are putting decisions on hold with respect to multi-year commitments. Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Maybe I'll ask the question a little differently. Would you characterize CapEx then as pent up? So whenever this uncertainty is lifted, do you have some idea of what could come back to the market? Or do you think some of this is just lost over a longer period of time? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: What gives us hope and optimism is that typically in the face of expansion on the consumer side of the economy, that that expansion in consumer consumption at some point translates to an increase in investment in manufacturing equipment and manufacturing assets so on the industrial side of the house. In historical expansion periods, it's been about a 12-month delay and we're well into that already where the consumer side of the economy has continued to grow, yet we've not seen the investment in manufacturing in the industrial side of the economy. And that would suggest perhaps there is some pent-up demand out there, but, once again, we have to wait and see whether or not it actually plays through the way it has historically. Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: All right. Thanks for the color. Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: At this point we're going to wrap up our call for this morning. As always, we'll be available to take follow-up questions for you immediately after today and for the rest of the week. Thank you all for joining us for our earnings call today. Operator : Thank you.

Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Eaton fourth quarter 2016 earnings conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question and answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. Also, as a reminder, today's teleconference is being recorded. At this time, I'll turn the conference over to your host, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Don Bullock. Please go ahead, sir. Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: Good morning. I'm Don Bullock, for those of you who don't know me. I'm Eaton's Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. I want to thank you all for joining us for our fourth quarter 2016 earnings call. With me today are Craig Arnold, our Chairman and CEO, and Rick Fearon, our Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer. As is typical, our agenda today is going to include opening remarks by Craig, highlighting our performance in the fourth quarter and our outlook for 2017. As has also been our previous practice in past calls, we'll be taking questions at the end of Craig's comments. The press release for our earnings announcement this morning and the presentation have been posted on our website at www.eaton.com. Please note that both the press release and the presentation do include reconciliations to non-GAAP measures. And a webcast of this call is accessible on our website and will be available for replay for those of you who will not be able to listen to the whole call. Before we get started, I'd like to remind you that our comments today do include statements related to expected future results and are therefore considered forward-looking statements. The actual results may differ from those and from our forecasted projections due to a number and range of risks and uncertainties that we describe in both our earnings release, the presentation, or are outlined in the 10-K. With all of that, I'll turn it over to Craig. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Thanks, Don, appreciate it. Hey, let me begin by saying that we're really pleased with our fourth quarter results. Our net income and operating EPS was $1.12 versus our guidance of $1.05, to $1.15, $1.10 midpoint. Our revenues were down 4%, 3% organically, and our organic growth was slightly better, actually, than our forecast, but it was more than offset by weaker FX. Segment margins were 14.6%, but 16.3% excluding restructuring. So our teams really executed well and did a nice job of controlling costs in the quarter. As noted, our restructuring costs in the quarter were $90 million, up $66 million from our prior guidance. This represents an acceleration of approximately $70 million of restructuring actions that were previously planned for Q1 2017 into Q4. Now, we made this decision to accelerate our restructuring spending in the quarter after we determined that we'd have $70 million of other income in Q4 from resolving a number of insurance matters. These matters primarily relate to past expenses, where we were able to finally reach an agreement with our insurers. This was a significant accomplishment by our team, as some of these matters go back multiple years. Operating cash flow was $638 million in the quarter. This includes a $100 million contribution into our U.S. qualified pension plan. And as a result, our operating cash flow was $2.6 billion for the year. In addition, we purchased $163 million of stock in the quarter, bringing our total repurchases to $730 million for the year, or 2.6% of outstanding shares at the beginning of the year. Turning to page 4, we have a couple of unusual items in the quarter, so we thought it would be helpful to create a bridge reconciling the midpoint of our EPS guidance with our actual results of $1.12 a share. Organic revenues were modestly better, as I noted, than \u2013 up from our expectations. Recall that we guided a sequential organic decline of 1.5% from Q3, and so that added a couple of cents. Negative currency had a $0.01 negative impact on the quarter, largely based upon strength in the U.S. dollar. Our operating performance was better than expected, and that added $0.01. Next we had two offsetting items : The income from the insurance matters added $70 million or $0.14. And, as I noted, we took this opportunity provided by the insurance income to accelerate restructuring actions of $70 million in the quarter, and that was a $0.14 negative. We'll go through restructuring in more detail later in the presentation, but this acceleration of restructuring costs does reduce what we expect to spend in 2017. So on balance, we think $1.12 represents solid performance during the quarter, a period where we continue to experience weakness in our end markets. And taking a quick look at the income statement, I'd note that organic revenue decline was driven primarily by continued weakness in industrial projects in the oil and gas market, construction equipment and NAFTA heavy duty truck. And as you'll see later in the presentation, organic revenues in the quarter declined in Vehicle, Hydraulics, and Electrical Systems and Services as a result. Against those conditions, we put up very solid operating performance in the quarter, with segment margins of 16.3%, excluding restructuring costs. And despite a 4% decline in revenue, we were able to increase margins by 30 basis points, excluding restructuring costs in the quarter. So we think once again strong performance. And our overall restructuring spending of $90 million in the quarter, with $83 million of that in the segments, and we'll certainly provide more details in subsequent slides on restructuring. Let me begin my segment comments with Electrical Products. Revenues were flat year on year, up 1% organically in spite of continued weakness in industrial markets. Areas where we saw notable sales growth included lighting, residential products and fuses. And areas of weakness was really in single-phase UPS and also in industrial controls. Orders were up 3%, a sequential improvement of 1% from Q3. We saw order strength in the Americas and the Asia-Pacific region. And in the Americas, product areas that experienced solid growth were residential products, lightning, and in Asia-Pacific in our power quality business. Operating margins were once again very strong at 18.4%, and excluding restructuring costs, margins were a healthy 19.4%. Page 7 covers our Electrical Systems and Services businesses, where revenues were down some 3%, and down 2% organically versus Q4 2015. Areas of strength included commercial assemblies, engineering services, and three-phase PQ. And areas of weakness continued to include large industrial assemblies and oil and gas related projects. Orders were down 7% in the quarter, a couple points worse than we experienced in Q3, where orders were down some 5%. Here the pattern of weakness is really unchanged. In the Americas, it's large industrial projects and oil and gas that remain weak, and areas of strength included Asia-Pacific, particularly in power distribution projects, and we too experienced the China surge that other companies have referenced. Operating margins were 12.2%, and excluding restructuring costs, margins were 14.2%, slightly better than last year. On slide 8, revenue in our Hydraulics businesses was down 6%, 5% organically, and this was a small improvement from Q3, where revenues were down 6% organically. Sales decline in the quarter was led by stationary sales, with particular weakness and oil and gas. Distribution and OEM sales were down about the same amount. We did, however, see order growth in the quarter, up some 8%, with strength in orders in mobile OEMs. And distribution orders were also up modestly in the quarter. Operating margins in the quarter were 7.1% but heavily impacted some 440 basis points by the acceleration of restructuring costs. Excluding restructuring, our margins were 11.5%, and we're pleased with the progress the business is making in general and the level of profitability, given these the historic lows of market activities. So we continue to believe that the business is on track and confident that we'll achieve our near- and long-term margin objectives for the business. In Aerospace, sales in Q4 were down 3%, and 100% of this decline was the result of foreign exchange strength of the U.S. dollar. And I'd also note that revenues in the quarter were negatively impacted by 3% due to weaker nonrecurring engineering billing. These are the engineering costs that we incur that are subsequently reimbursed by customers. In addition, we continue to see weakness in the bizjet market, as you've heard from others. Orders in the quarter were down 1% on weakness in bizjet and military fighters. Areas of strength continue to be commercial military transports and military rotorcraft. Operating margins were a healthy 19.8%, and excluding restructuring costs, margins were 20%, the same as Q3. In looking at the Vehicle segment, organic revenues were down 12% on weakness in commercial vehicle production, largely in the U.S. Specifically, NAFTA Class 8 truck production in the quarter was down some 34% versus Q4 of 2015. Retail light vehicle markets were flat in the U.S., with modest growth in Europe and significant strength in China. On another positive note, we're encouraged to see that we think what was a return to growth in Latin America, with most of our served markets posting year-on-year growth. Operating margins were 13.1%, and excluding restructuring costs, 14.8%. For 2017, we expect NAFTA heavy-duty truck market to be flat with 2016, and we expect modest growth in global light vehicle markets really around the world. We also expect to see growth in the Brazilian vehicle market in 2017. Turning our attention back to the company's overall results, slide 11 provides a summary of our full-year restructuring costs incurred in 2016. Now, as you recall, our prior guidance for 2016 included $145 million in restructuring costs for the year. And as we've discussed and shown here, we had $70 million of income in Q4 from insurance matters, which was not included in our guidance. As a result, we decided to move forward some of the restructuring actions planned for 2017 into the fourth quarter. This action took our restructuring to $90 million for the quarter, up some $24 million from what we originally had in our guidance. The $90 million was comprised of $20 million of spending from our original actions, down $4 million due to lower costs needed to complete those same actions, plus $70 million from actions we accelerated from 2017 into 2016. And as a result, we incurred, as you can see here, $211 million of restructuring costs in 2016. So, overall, we're pleased with the progress that we've made on these initiatives, and we continue to deliver slightly better benefits on slightly lower costs. Slide 12 provides a detail summary of the $211 million of restructuring costs by segment, and as you can see, we're undergoing really significant restructuring in all segments, with the exception of Aerospace. The restructuring activities are particularly large in Hydraulics and Electrical Systems and Services, where markets have been weakest. In Vehicle, where we've been preparing for the next cyclical downturn, which is now upon us in truck North America; and in Electrical Products, where despite very strong margins, we simply have opportunities to be more efficient. So as we close the books on 2016, we think it's worth taking a few moments to note some of the key highlights of the year. First, as we articulated during the year, a number of our end markets were weaker than we expected, and this resulted in organic revenues coming in some $200 million below the midpoint of our guidance. Foreign exchange was somewhat better than we expected and came in $100 million better than expected. We delivered on our sizable restructuring plan, which resulted in strong margin performance. Excluding restructuring, margins were 16%, up 20 basis points from 2015 on 5% lower revenue. Restructuring benefits were $210 million, and restructuring costs were $211 million, keeping this initiative well ahead of schedule. We were disappointed that we missed our EPS commitment for the year. As you'll recall, our guidance was originally $4.30. Our actual results came in at $4.22 a share, down 2% from the midpoint of our guidance. Cash flow in 2016 was strong, with free cash flow over net income at 107%, and our free cash flow over sales was 10.4%. And we continued to use our strong cash flow to reward shareholders. We increased our dividend in February of 2016 and repurchased $730 million of our shares during the year. In addition, we paid down $240 million of debt in Q1 and contributed $100 million to our U.S. qualified pension plan in December. So on balance, I'd say a solid year of progress that's positioned the company well for 2017 and beyond. So if we shift our focus to the outlook for 2017, here's a first look at our organic revenue growth expectations for the year. But before the numbers, maybe a little bit of context here. While we're hearing more optimistic commentary about markets and think we will see the introduction of government policies that are more growth-oriented, we're not yet seeing signs of this in our businesses, and so this guidance really reflects what we see today without changes in government policy. In our Electrical Products business in the U.S., our expectations are that residential lighting will be up mid-single digit. We think single-phase and PQ will be flat, and we think industrial controls will be down low single-digit. In other geographies, we expect Europe and Asia-Pacific to be up low single digit, with Latin America up mid-single digit. In Electrical Systems and Services, we expect to see another year of decline as a result of weak large-project activity and ongoing reductions in oil and gas. One bright spot is commercial assemblies, where we think it'll be up mid-single digit, but that's offset by industrial products, which we think will be down double digit. Harsh and hazardous down mid-single digit, with three-phase UPS down slightly. In Hydraulics, we expect to see some modest growth as China improves, as well as other mobile equipment markets. Aerospace markets are expected to see slight growth, driven by commercial transport and aftermarket. And in Vehicle, as noted, we see the NAFTA Class 8 market being essentially flat, with modest growth in Brazil truck and ag equipment, and then slight growth in global vehicle markets around the world. And with the noted growth expectations, page 15 shows our margin expectations for each of the businesses. And so I'm not going to read through every one of these, but these are the full-year margins including restructuring costs. And, as you can see, the midpoint of our guidance is 15.8% operating margins, up from 15% last year, and despite an assumption of generally flat markets, we continue to see margin improvement in each of our businesses. Next, if we take a closer look at our restructuring program, you see that we're on track, spending less and projecting to have higher savings than we originally anticipated. This chart is a summary of how our restructuring program will impact earnings over the next couple of years. First, beginning with 2017, costs are expected to be $100 million, reflecting the $70 million of restructuring acceleration into 2016 at the end of the year. We also updated our cost estimates for 2017 actions, and it's coming in about $10 million lower than our prior estimate, and that's good news. And we expect $155 million of incremental benefits in 2017. In total, the program will deliver $266 million of incremental profits when you net off the lower spending and the higher savings. For 2018, the program will deliver $175 million of incremental profits versus 2017, $75 million of incremental benefits and $100 million of lower spending. So as we wrap up the spending program in 2017, we think it's important to remember that we will have ongoing restructuring in the business in 2018. We expect to spend roughly $60 million a year of ongoing restructuring costs that will be embedded in the business results, and this spending is expected to result in $60 million of benefits, but spread over two years. And we've modeled this expectation, 2018 with $60 million of costs and $30 million of savings impacting that year. Turning our attention to 2017, we expect operating EPS and net income per share to be between $4.30 and $4.60 a share, a 5% increase in operating EPS on flat revenue, and a 6% increase in net income per share. Our assumptions are as follows, and you can see them laid out here, but organic revenues are expected to be flat with 2016. We expect to see $300 million of negative FX, and we expect to see segment margins between 15.5% and 16.1% as a result of the items laid out and depicted here, $111 million of lower restructuring costs, $155 million of higher benefits, offset somewhat by some commodity headwinds that we're experiencing in the business, some $80 million of commodity headwinds. Now, this is due largely to the recent and rapid increase in commodity prices, and the lag that we will experience or expect to experience in our ability to offset this increase with price and other actions. Corporate expenses are expected to be flat with 2016. We expect the tax rate to be 9.5% to 10.5%, up from 9.5% in 2016. And we expect another year of strong cash flow, with operating cash flows between $2.6 billion and $2.8 billion, and CapEx of $525 million. And we'll continue our share purchase program and expect to repurchase $750 million of our stock during the year. For Q1 2017, our guidance is we expect revenues to be down 3% versus Q1 of 2016, and about half of that is essentially organic declines, and about half of that is foreign exchange. Margins of 13.6% to 14%, driven by seasonally lower volumes, and as I mentioned, higher commodity prices in the first part of the year. Our tax rate, we think, will be 6% to 7%, lower than full-year expectations, largely due to some legal reorganizations that we expect to occur in Q1. And finally, page 18 is a summary of our 2017 assumptions and expectations. We've covered each of these in prior pages already, so I'll save some time by not going back through them. Overall we think it's a sound plan that's reflective of the journey that we're on to improve the company while navigating in weak markets and think the company is in very good shape to deliver. So I'll stop here and turn it back to Don Bullock. Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: If you have a question at this point, our operator will give you instructions for those of you who have questions. Operator : Thank you very much. Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: Before we jump into the questions, I do want to make a couple of comments. If you would, please, given the time constraints today, if you would hold your questions to a single question and a single follow-up, to be sure we get through the number of people who have questions for us. Our first question today comes from Steve Winoker with Bernstein. Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thanks. And good morning, all. I wanted to just ask a couple questions, one on the tax side and one on Hydraulics. On the tax front, I think you're a net exporter from a finished goods perspective out of the U.S., but maybe give us a little more color there and then how you kind of still currently see the out-year tax rate coming together. You used to talk about 10%, or so, or maybe a little higher than that. And if you were to run through the current proposals Brady and Ryan have discussed, how are you thinking that might affect you? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Rick, do you want to grab that one? Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc: Steve, let me jump in on that one. It's a very popular topic these days. First of all, let me just make the comment that it is really impossible to know what changes at the end of the day we're going to see in U.S. tax policy. As you well know, there are many different proposals and strong supporters of each proposal, and so how that sorts out, I really don't know. But let me just say this : Without knowing the exact policy changes, if the policy that came in was something along the lines of a border adjustment tax, we believe the impact on us would not be significant, since we are balanced if you total up our imports. And we've recently been looking in some detail at this just to make sure we fully understand the numbers. But we're balanced when you total up the imports versus our direct and indirect exports. When I say indirect, we make a lot of parts that go into other assemblies, other people's products that are then exported. And so we believe the way it would come out, we would likely be able to get an offset for all of those exports. So we should be neutral. Beyond that, there are proposals about interest limitations, (25:18) some of which would only have new interest limited. And so it's very hard to figure out what of the other proposals would come about. The one that seems to be getting the most attention is this border adjusted idea. Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. All right. Go ahead. Sorry. Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc: No. That was all I was going to say. Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. I'll leave it there for now. I mean, I know it is hard to tell, but I guess the only other question on that front is, if in fact just the rate side comes, ignoring the interest deductibility, given where your current rate is but your marginal impact in the U.S., you guys would still benefit from any kind of marginal reduction in the U.S., absent \u2013 all other things being equal; is that true? Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yes. Yeah, that is true, and so depending on how much the headline U.S. rate comes down, we would see some benefit in our overall rate. And you did have one other part your question. Let me address that as well. And that is, we're a 9.5% to 10.5% as a guided rate for 2017, and I think you were wondering how that's likely to change into the future. But we continue to think that the rate it's likely to move up slowly, perhaps a point or so each year over the next few years. And so we don't really see any change to our prior guidance. Of course, subject to the rules not changing. As the rules change, it could have some impact. But, as I just said, we can't know exactly what the new rules are. Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. And then, Craig, just on Hydraulics, after I think 10 quarters of negative year-on-year bookings growth, at least having a plus 8%, even if it's on an easier comp, do you think there's real sustainability here? And why aren't we yet hitting those \u2013 even the bottom end \u2013 of the through-the-cycle margins ex restructuring for next year? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yeah, no, I'd say that, to your point, we too are optimistic and encouraged by the fact that we saw orders grow 8% in the quarter. This is the first quarter of growth in orders that we've seen in a long time, but it is only one data point. And so what we're looking at as we try to forecast what the revenues will be in our Hydraulics business in 2017, is we're obviously looking at lots of data points, including what many of our customers are saying. And so we think \u2013 we're very comfortable saying that we think we'll see very slight growth in Hydraulics during the course of the year. But at this point, we're not forecasting kind of the V-shaped recoveries that we have historically seen in this business. You never know. When these markets turn, they tend to turn hard and fast, but we're not yet in a position to call that turn. With respect to margins, I would tell you that we're not finished, and we are in the midst of some pretty significant restructuring actions in our Hydraulics business, so still a lot of work to be done during the course of 2017. We still have not \u2013 you're right, we absolutely have reached new bottoms, and quite frankly, we've reached lower bottoms than we ever imagined that we would reach in the business. And so we're comfortable once fully completed that the business will in fact deliver the 13% that we articulated and committed to, but we're not yet finished with all the restructuring. Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks. Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: Our next question comes from Shannon O'Callaghan with UBS. Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC : Morning, guys. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Morning. Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC : So, Craig, just in terms of the trends in ESS, when you're referring to the industrial projects and the oil and gas projects, I mean, you're referring to them as large projects, and those still being down. I mean, is there no, I guess, offset or any signs of improvement in smaller projects or MRO activity? Could you just maybe fill that out a little bit? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yeah, no. We, in the light commercial piece of the business, we clearly are experiencing and seeing growth in that segment of the business, but it's simply being overwhelmed by the large industrial projects and what's happening in the manufacturing sector. So while we're seeing some signs of strength on that part of the business, it's not anywhere near enough to offset what's going on in large projects and oil and gas. And we do think, as we take a look at the oil and gas assumption for 2017, yes, rig counts have increased nicely, and that's a good indicator, but we've not yet seen a significant turn in orders. And we think in our harsh and hazardous business that we talked about in Electrical Systems and Services, we think it's another down year. We could be wrong. We hope we're wrong, that a lot of the enthusiasm today that's built into a number of expectations, we hope that translates into orders and sales, but we've just not yet seen it. And I think what we've been pretty consistent about is that we've said that we'll call the turn when we actually see it show up in our orders and not before. Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. That makes sense. Just maybe also, just on the power, kind of utility business, can you give us an update what you've been seeing there, and if there's any change on that going into 2017? Thanks. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yeah, really no change. I mean, we see that business being \u2013 essentially running slight increases year-over-year, and we don't anticipate to see any material change in the power systems business. We'd expect that it would see very, very slight growth during the course of the year. Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks. Good morning, guys. Craig, I want to switch back to restructuring, and looks like you got about 80 bps of benefit year-over-year from the payback on the actions. I think you're forecasting about 20 bps clean, ex restructuring, expansion on flat revenues obviously. But maybe just fill us in, in terms of some of the offsets to those cost actions and maybe touch on price/cost for 2017, and maybe some comp adjustments and maybe mix. Anything to help us bridge those margins would be helpful. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yeah, (32:12) appreciate the question. There's really one bridging item that I would say. I think most of the other items, we don't necessarily expect dramatic changes in mix during the course of the year, although we continue to see the large projects, and large industrial projects do tend to be more profitable than certainly the light commercial stuff. But the big issue for us that we're dealing with during the year of 2017 is really commodity prices. And over the last 10 years we certainly have seen price volatility, and we have always been kind of net neutral. So we've always been able to get price or offset commodity price increases to the point where it's really had no impact on our overall underlying margins. What we are really dealing with, we think, today is a lot of speculation built into the expectations of global growth, and hence the demand for commodities or the price of commodities have really been fluctuating quite significantly. Just to give you, as a point of quantification, post the U.S. elections, our commodity prices on the basket of commodities that Eaton acquires are up 7%, making this issue obviously a bit more difficult to manage and to pass on quickly in the marketplace. We're seeing also large swings in volatility. To give you maybe another couple of data points that will maybe be helpful, bar steel prices over the last 12 months have been as low as $185 a ton, and they hit a high at the end of the year of $303 a ton. And today, they're $265 a ton. Copper prices over the last 30 days have been as low as $2.49 a pound. Today they're $2.73 a pound. So a 10% change over a 30-day period. And so this period of volatility is really going to have to work its way through the system before we can really understand exactly where commodity prices are going to settle out and where we can put plans in place to either offset them or pass it on in the marketplace. And so as a result what's built into our guidance is this $80 million of commodity price increase cost that is not being offset by either price increases or other measures during the course of the year. But that's on an $8 billion to $9 billion direct materials spend, and we do expect to offset it, but we think will probably going to be a quarter or two later than we'd like to be ideally. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Just to clarify that point, Craig, so $80 million is baked in as a hedge to margins, but you think \u2013 you can probably get that, but it's not baked into your guidance? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: No. What I'm saying is, we can get it. But we think the timing that it's going to take us to actually implement the actions will be delayed by essentially a quarter or two, and we actually will see an $80 million of negative impact in our year-over-year margins as a result of commodity price increases. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, that's clear. Yeah. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: But it will be delayed in the implementation. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Understood. So that's clear. And then my follow-on question is, I think your revenue plan looks very reasonable overall, but a big surprise for us was the single-phase UPS down in the quarter, and then you talked about three-phase being down in 2017. Can you maybe just add some color there in terms of what you're seeing perhaps in the data center markets? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yeah. And I'd say that it's just been another one of these markets that's bounced around quite a bit, and as you may have heard from others, we had a number of large projects by Microsoft and others that were delayed out of 2017 as they look at reconfiguring data centers and the way they protect their centers. And so the market for us, it's been volatile, some of which you'd say is structural, but a lot of it is simply customer-specific issues as they work through their future architecture of the way they'd like to protect their global data centers. But we continue to see the underlying strength in the cloud, and that's going to be a long-term positive for the business. But we have in fact seen some short-term, let's say, volatility in demand in those markets. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks for the color. Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: Our next question comes from David Raso with Evercore. David Raso - Evercore ISI Group : Hi. Good morning. We always spoke the last few years about November of 2007 (sic) [2017] as an interesting time, just given the ability to spin some businesses tax-free. Now that that's upon us, only nine months away, I just wanted to get an update if that's still accurate, and how you're thinking about that event? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yeah. And for us, as we've said pretty clearly in the past -for us there is nothing magical about the end of 2017. We have today a collection of businesses that we like. We fully intend to continue to invest in all of them. We have no intentions to spin any of our businesses, and so for us, we're not spending even a moment thinking about it. David Raso - Evercore ISI Group : Okay. So I'm just trying to think through. Some people look at the sum of the parts, and if they feel there is a gap between how the company's being valued in aggregate versus maybe how it would be separate, is that something you're averse to? Or just as it goes right now, you're not really thinking of it that way in how you're running the businesses? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: There's lots of different points of view around sum of the parts and how you do the math, and is it pre-tax or post-tax. And so without getting into a large discussion on this issue, today we think from a shareholder value perspective, we spend a lot of time looking at the business. We have, over our history, have acquired and divested many businesses, and so we're not in any way averse to divesting businesses. We've laid out a very specific criteria around businesses in terms of what they need to deliver to continue to be part of our company, and we're comfortable today that all of our businesses are either delivering against that criteria, or well on the way towards delivering it. David Raso - Evercore ISI Group : All right. I appreciate it. Thank you. Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hi. Thank you. My first question is really on the vehicles. In 2016 you missed your initial revenue guide in that segment by 4%, and then if we look at your 2017 it seems to embed a very substantial V-shaped recovery. The NAFTA deliveries are down 30% right now; you're assuming they're flat for 2017. So particularly in light of the experience in 2016, why did you decide a sort of a V shape around the middle of the year was the right guidance? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Again I'd say, first, acknowledging your original point, we and the industry overall missed our North America Class 8 forecast for the year, and as the year unfolded, we and others had multiple downward revisions in the North America Class 8 market, and principally because the industry really came into the year carrying a lot of excess inventory that needed to work its way through the system. So today we think the North America Class 8 market in 2017 is flat with 2016. And based upon our analysis, the age of the fleet, the amount of inventory that's in the system, what we're hearing from fleets and customers, we think that's a prudent forecast. And the shape of the year, as you well know, the truck industry does tend to be lumpy. There's big quarters and there's small quarters, and it's not nearly as linear as we'd all like it to be. And so we think that our teams have put a lot of work into modeling what the year looks like, and we're confident that flat is a reasonable estimate at this point in time. And largely consistent with what we're hearing from our customers. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Got it. Thank you. And then my follow-up would just be on the phasing of the $100 million or so of restructuring costs that you expect through 2017. How much of that is sort of coming in the first quarter and first half of this fiscal year? Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc: It's clearly going to be oriented more to the first half of the year, Julian. That's what you would expect. But we did, as Craig mentioned, we did pull some actions forward already. And so it won't be quite as lumpy as it was in 2016, but it'll still be majority oriented to the first half of the year. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. So we should expect maybe about half of it coming in the first quarter or something? Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc: Well, I don't want to be pinned down by quarter, but it's going to be the majority will likely be in the first half of the year. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Very helpful. Thank you. Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey, good morning, guys. So one comment, I guess. I give you some kudos for continuing to be appropriately cautious, because you're not seeing the trends really turn positive in your business, so kudos for being conservative there. But I guess maybe focused on ESS for a second. The organic growth has decelerated now throughout the year. You're forecasting organic growth to be down for the third straight year. I guess my broader question is, is it end-market trends? Do you feel like there are maybe some missed opportunities? And are you configured correctly in that business today? Or do you need to invest or divest any potential businesses within that business today? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Hey, Joe. It's a good question, and I'd say, maybe just hitting your specific point head on, no, we're absolutely convinced that we're not losing share in this business. If you take a look at the peers who report in the same space and the data that we give, it's pretty convincing that it really is a market issue largely tied to what's going on today in industrial markets and manufacturing and large projects. And so we don't in any way feel like we have a market competitiveness issue in that business. And as you'll likely understand as well, is that many of the things that we make in our products business ends up in our systems business as a consume components out of our products business. And so, no, we like the Electrical Systems and Services business. We have some work to do to continue to restructure that business, to deal with the inherent volatility that's inside of that business, so that even at very low levels of economic activity we can deliver attractive margins. And that's the path that the team is on. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay, fair enough. And I guess my one follow-up there would be on just cash flow and your guidance for the year. It looks like you made about a $100 million pension contribution in 2016. Are you expecting to make contributions in 2017? Because if I add that back I get closer towards the midpoint of your guidance range, and so just wanted to understand the puts and takes in the cash flow for 2017. Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yeah, Joe, you'll see it on the last page of the presentation. We made a $100 million contribution in December of 2016, and we made a $100 million contribution in January of 2017, and so that's already factored into the cash flow guidance we're giving for the year. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. I see that now. Any other puts and takes that we need to be aware of, Rick? Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc: Not really. I mean, as you see, revenues are relatively flat, absent FX, and so you don't see significant use or cash flow from working capital, because it's typically oriented at the top line, and so nothing else that's unusual. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey, thanks, guys. Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical. Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Thank you. Good morning. Just wondering if you could touch on lighting. Craig, you called it out as strong in the quarter. There's been a lot of mixed results out there in this quarter, as you probably know. How did your volumes perform? What's going on with pricing? Any color you can give us on your LED mix would be helpful. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yes. Appreciate the question. We did have another what we think is a strong quarter in lighting in Q4. Our actual revenues were up mid-single digit, and our LED sales, as a percentage of overall sales, came in at 72%, and so we continue to feel like our lighting business is performing well. The LED penetration continues to grow. We, like others, continue to see price concessions in that business as the cost of the technology comes down, and we're essentially shedding price in that business. But the price and the costs are essentially largely balanced. And so, from an underlying margin standpoint, we continue to make progress and improvements in our overall lighting business. Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Great. And I was wondering also just back to energy and not seeing any kind of firming up there. Can you just remind us or maybe update us on what your mix is now, upstream versus downstream, after two years of energy down cycle? Has your mix changed materially? In particular, if you could give us some color on U.S. upstream, would be interesting. Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yeah. Let me jump in and take that. As you know, before the downturn, we were very heavily \u2013 we had a higher orientation to upstream. We still had very good downstream exposure as well, and not so much in the midstream area. And so with this production downturn over the last couple years, we are definitely more balanced now. And more of an orientation towards downstream than upstream. And I can't give you an exact number because we haven't yet tallied exactly where we are from 2016, but clearly the upstream part has suffered in this downturn. And, as Craig said, it is interesting that the rig count has gone up as much is it has and yet we haven't really seen orders come through as a result of that. Now, whether that's because there will be a delay as some of these rigs that they're now putting back into action don't have aftermarket needs yet, it's hard to know. But it's something we're obviously watching closely. Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Great. Thanks for the color. Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: Our next question comes from Eli Lustgarten with Longbow. Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC : Good morning, everyone. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Morning. Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC : Can we just get a little more color on two segments? One on vehicles. You talked about a flat Class 8 market. But can you talk about what you're seeing in the automotive sector? I mean, there's a lot of projections of slightly declining sales this year. There's some talk of \u2013 some company talking about maybe a material production cut in the second half of the year versus European auto. Can you give us some idea of what you're seeing in that part of the business? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yeah, Eli. I mean, I'd say today, the global auto markets around the world continue to do extremely well. Even if we got the January numbers for the U.S. market and down from the fourth quarter kind of record levels but still north of 17 million cars and about flat with prior year, which is largely what our forecast is for North America. So we think North America continues to run at flat at very high levels. We think Europe is maybe some modest slight growth, and we think China continues to be kind of a standout performer. I mean, China really posted very large numbers during the course of 2016, and we think it moderates a bit, but we think it's still positive. So our own perspective on global markets around the world is that we think they continue to be slightly positive at very high levels, and there's been really no indication at this point of those markets turning over. Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC : Okay. And as you talk about Hydraulic, you sort of have a flat number. It's sort of hard with an 8%, I said we all keep talking we have (50:07) an 8% order step up in the quarter. Is that flatness because you expect a continued weakness in the OEM side or distribution? Or is it across the board? I mean, you had \u2013 the OEM side started to show some signs of life, but it's pretty hard to get just flat with the kind of numbers you're showing unless you expect parts of OEM to be weaker, or something happening in the marketplace. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: No, I'd say for us, Eli, it's largely a function of we have one quarter of data. And so we have one data point where we have strong orders off of relatively weak comparables in the prior year. And at this point you read the same kind of forecasts that we read. We see what our customers are saying about their forecasts for the year. And whether it's \u2013 you know all the big names in those markets. And then they're forecasting largely for another year of modest declines. We are very encouraged by what we're seeing in China. A lot of the government stimulus activities have certainly resulted in growth, and we saw growth in China during the course of 2016. And we think that continues. But at this point we just think it's too early to call bigger term, given the total composite of everything that we're seeing. Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC : I mean, your basic scenario is an up distribution market being offset by continuing weakness in OEM. Is that the balance of... Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yeah. I'd say even on the OEM side, right, it's different pictures of what's going on in OEM. We actually had a very good quarter of bookings in the OEM side in ag (51:48) and construction equipment in Q4. Question how much of that was inventory rebuild? How much of that was underlying demand in the market? I mean, you see some of the big customers' retail sales data. And so for us ultimately speaking that will be the governing item for what we eventually experience in our business. Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC : And probably to beat some price increases, I suspect. Thank you. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yes, Thanks. Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC : Okay. Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: Our next question comes from Ann Duignan with JPMorgan. Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi, thanks. A lot of my questions have been answered. But I'm going to focus on your outlook for Aerospace margins. Very strong, above 19%. Craig, could you talk a little bit about is there any concern that Aerospace is not investing in its own future? We need those engineering R&D dollars so that we win the next platform so we have the aftermarket 20 years from now? If you could just talk a little bit about the high margins versus the R&D spend. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: It's a great question, Ann, and you know this space very well. And so today, as we think about the R&D spend in the Aerospace business or any business, there are the dollars that you're investing in kind of off-line technology development, anticipating that, to your point, 10 or 20 years from now we'll need technology ready to insert in a new platform. And then there's specific customer programs and customer development projects, and that's the piece that we and quite frankly everybody in the industry has seen a significant fall-off in. The industry went through this massive period of refresh, whether that was on the commercial side or on the military side, and R&D spending really went up quite dramatically over the last 10 to 15 years as the industry went through major new program developments. And now they're coming down the other side of it, which is kind of a natural part of the Aerospace cycle. To your point, we are in fact continuing to invest in what we call off-line technology development, so that we're not sure when the next-generation single-aisle plane will be developed. We think it's 2025 or beyond, but we need to be ready when it does come. And we are making those investments. Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. That's helpful color. I appreciate that, because we don't like to see them too high for too long, either. And then a follow-up on your input costs. You said your basket of commodities that you purchased were up \u2013 or the index was up 7%. Can you just talk a little bit more about your spend? Are you being impacted more by copper or more by steel or a combination of both? Just a little bit more on the commodities (54:43) please. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yeah. I'd say for the most part, Ann, most of the commodities, certainly the two that you mentioned, are up, whether it's bar steel or flat steel or hot roller beam. So really it's almost across the board where we've seen commodity inflation creep into the system. And so it's \u2013 I mean, there are a few commodities, like silver and the like, that have perhaps come down slightly. But, for the most part, we've seen most of our commodity input costs go up over the last 90 days or so. Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc: And, Ann, it's fair to say that amongst our big spend items are clearly steel and copper. I mean, those, for obvious reasons, within the different products that our businesses make. And so those prices, the increases we've seen clearly have a significant impact on them. Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And just a quick follow-up. Will it be easier or faster to get pricing in places like Electrical Products because you're going direct to end markets versus Hydraulics, Aerospace, Vehicles where you're shipping into OEMs and maybe contracts lag? Is that the right way to think about it? Or how should I think about that? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yeah, no, I'd say in general, that would be an accurate way of thinking about it, Ann. I'd say the bigger issue that we're dealing with right now is really the volatility. We've seen, yes, this upward trend certainly in commodity prices, but we've also seen very high volatility. And as I shared a few examples with you in my opening commentary around \u2013 in the last 30 days, the price of copper has swung 10% over a period of 30 days. And so when you're living in a period of high volatility, it's really difficult to think about sitting across from a customer and saying, here's the price; therefore, we need to increase our prices. Or to really even talk about, how do you look at things that you can do to potentially offset it when you're living in this period of very high volatility. So we really do believe we need to see a little bit of stabilization in commodity prices, and a lot of the expectations around future growth to settle before we know where these commodities are actually going to land. We do believe that we think we're at higher levels today in commodity prices than it'll eventually settle out at, largely because of the global supply/demand equation. So we do think there's a lot of speculation today in commodity prices. Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yeah. It doesn't help with your forecasting jobs. Okay. I'll leave it there. Thank you very much. Good luck. Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: Our next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Hey, we've covered a lot of ground here. I wanted to circle back on this decision to do accelerated restructuring. And be curious to know about the timing of this. Which actually came first? Did you have the need to do the restructuring and capacity to do the restructuring in the fourth quarter and then you were able to harvest those insurance settlements? But I'm also hearing a number of companies, facing the administration change, you saw a lot of settlements happening in the fourth quarter because of that uncertainty. So which came first? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Deane, as I think we laid out more than a year ago, we had a very large and comprehensive restructuring plan that our teams had already identified a number of actions that we intended to take. And so in our case, it was simply the fact that we had the plans and the actions already identified. We ended up with \u2013 our team did an outstanding job of negotiating a settlement on these insurance matters. And so we simply pulled forward the actions from early Q1 into Q4. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Yeah. And just from our perspective to be able to get that much restructuring done in a fourth quarter is a pretty tough task, and it looked like it happened pretty smoothly. And then maybe just some context about shifting to the pay-as-you-go restructuring in 2018. How do you decide that $60 million is the right run rate? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: And I'd say that it's probably more art than science around the number of $60 million, and I would ask that you not hold us precisely to that number. We think, as a placeholder and looking at what we've spent historically to take on various improvements in underlying efficiency in the organization, that's a good placeholder number to use. But we'll certainly \u2013 we'll likely see some slight variation around that number. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Sure. That's helpful. Thank you. Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: As we cross the top of the hour, we're going to have time for one more question here, and that comes from Andy Casey with Wells Fargo. Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thanks a lot. Good morning, everybody. On the Hydraulics, just return to that; I know there's been a lot of questions on it. But the order improvement, was that truncated to December? We've seen some other reports that kind of suggest the end-of-quarter surge, if you will. And then I know it's not really common practice for you, but if it was truncated to the end of the quarter, did you see those trends continue into January? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yeah, in our case, Andy, the simple \u2013 short answer to the question is no, it was not a December surge, as we also have heard others articulate, spending budgets at the end of the year. We really did see the strength largely play out throughout the quarter. And so far in January, I'd say that we're encouraged that some of the strength that we've seen in Q4 has continued. Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Great. Thank you very much. Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: Thank you all for joining us today. As always, we'll be available for follow-up questions today, tomorrow, and into next week. Thank you again for joining us for our 2016 fourth quarter earnings call. Operator : Thank you. And, ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference call for today. We do thank you for your participation and for using AT&T's Executive Teleconference. You may now disconnect.",

Welcome to the Eaton First Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Don Bullock. Please go ahead. Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: Good morning. I'm Don Bullock, Eaton's Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you all for joining us for Eaton's first quarter 2017 earnings call. With me today are Craig Arnold, our Chairman and CEO and Rick Fearon, our Vice Chairman and Chief Financial and Planning Officer. The agenda today as typical will include opening remarks from Craig highlighting the results in the quarter along with our outlook for 2017. As we've done in our past calls, we'll also be taking questions at the end of Craig's comments. The press release from our earnings announcement this morning and the presentation we'll go through today after some initial technical delays were posted on our website at www.eaton.com. Please note that the press release and the presentation do include reconciliations to non-GAAP measures. A webcast of this, today's call will also be available for replay after the call. Before we get started, I do want to remind you that our comments today do include forward-looking statements and the actual results may differ from those and that any of those risks and uncertainties are outlined in our related 8-K that's filed. With that, I'll turn it over to Craig. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Thanks, Don. Hey, we're very pleased with our Q1 results. As you've seen, net income and operating EPS coming in at $0.96 per share and 13% above the midpoint of our guidance which was $0.85 a share. And we're especially pleased to see the return to positive revenue growth in the quarter. This quarter represents the first quarter in over eight quarters where revenue growth is positive and reflects improving market conditions in many of our businesses with real acceleration in the month of March. Organic revenues were up 2% with ForEx being a negative 1% in the quarter. Segment margins were 14.4%, and we'll speak in more detail about this later in the presentation, but excluding restructuring costs of $17 million in the quarter, segment operating margins were 14.8%. We also had very strong cash flow in the quarter of $463 million which was a Q1 record. And this does include a $100 million contribution that we made to our U.S. qualified pension fund in the quarter. In addition, we repurchased $255 million or 3.6 million shares in the quarter and increased our quarterly dividend from $0.57 to $0.60 per share and we announced this back in February. Turning to page 4, we've outlined the major drivers of the Q1 EPS results which exceeded our guidance which we, as you'll recall, was $0.85 at the midpoint. And the real story here is revenue. Organic revenues were up slightly below 2% but approximately 3 points higher than our original guidance. And as you'll recall, our guidance for net revenues were going to be down 1.5%. FX was also 1% less negative than our original guidance of 1.5%. Total restructuring costs in the quarter were actually $20 million, with $17 million of that in the reporting segments, which was about $6 million lower than our original plans. And we'll talk more about the restructuring program for Q1 and the remainder of the year later in the presentation. Finally, total corporate expenses were up about $0.02, driven by largely pension expense in the quarter which was slightly higher than we anticipated. But on balance, we think a very strong performance really led by the increase in volume. Quickly looking at segment income statement. As we mentioned, organic growth was up 2%, driven principally by strength in Hydraulics and Electrical Products segment offsetting about 1% negative FX overall. Segment operating profits were up 4% or $30 million in the quarter to $700 million. And excluding the impact of restructuring costs, segment margins were down about 30 basis points from Q1 of 2016 but at 14.8%. As we discussed when we provided guidance for Q1, we did see commodity cost inflation in the quarter that in many ways largely offset some of the additional restructuring benefits that we would ordinarily have seen flow thorough, but we do expect this issue to wash out by time we hit the second a half of the year. So we see it as largely a first half issue, and between the work that we're doing around cost and pricing, we don't expect to see this impact linger on into the second half of 2017. Overall, restructuring expenses declined from $63 million in Q1 2016 to $20 million in Q1 2017, with a portion once again reflected in the segment results declining from $59 million to $17 million respectively. Turning to Electrical Products segment, revenues were up 2% with organic revenues up 3%, so you have 1% negative FX. And revenues were up in all regions, consistent with the pattern that we've been seeing, where we saw strength in residential products and lighting. What's really new this quarter is the strength that we experienced in industrial controls, and particularly in the European market. Orders were up 3% in the quarter. We saw growth in the U.S. and in Europe. Residential products were up low double digits. Lighting was up low single digits. Industrial controls was up low single digit. And the areas of strength were particularly offset by some weakness that we saw in single-phase power quality, largely a result of a onetime order that we had in Q1 of 2016. Order growth in Q4 2016 was also up 3%, so this is really a continuation of the pattern that we've seen in our Electrical Products segment. We're also very pleased with the operating margins at 17.4%, or 17.6% excluding restructuring costs, up some 50 basis points over Q1 2016. And looking at Electrical Systems and Services, organic revenues were flat in the quarter, and we see this as really good news after eight quarters of consecutive revenue declines. ForEx was down 1%. Sales in the quarter continued to be impacted by weakness in what we call large industrial projects, and in the oil and gas segment, so very much consistent with what you've likely seen from others and heard from others. Regionally, we saw strength in Europe and Asia. We also experienced strength in the Americas in commercial assemblies, and in three-phase power quality. Our orders in the quarter were flat. We saw notable order strength however in Asia, offsetting continued weakness in the Americas and in Europe. And I will point out though, flat orders in the quarter, this does compare to a 7% decline in Q4 of 2016, so perhaps an inflection point. Margins were down 30 basis points year-on-year to 11.6%, down 90 basis points to 11.8% when you exclude restructuring costs. And so we do continue to experience a negative margin impact as large industrial projects and oil and gas remain weak in this segment. On to Hydraulics, and perhaps in the biggest story in the quarter, as it appears that markets are showing significant improvement. Organic revenue was up 9% in the quarter following strength in orders that we noted in Q4, and orders were up 22% in Q1 on strength in what we saw in really all regions of the world with particular strength in Asia followed by Europe. And the order strength really extended both to the OEM and the distribution channels, and both were up double digit, so really a broad-based strengthening in our Hydraulics business. Segment operating margins continued to improve. They were up 280 basis points over Q1 of 2016, at 10.2%, and excluding restructuring costs up 150 basis points year-on-year to 11.8%. And this improvement reflects the continued benefit that we're seeing from the restructuring program for sure. But I'd also note that it's been somewhat mitigated by a regional mix impact from stronger revenue growth in Asia-Pacific where margins tend to be modestly below those in North America. Turning to Aerospace, organic revenues in the quarter were down 1%, with foreign exchange down 3% in the quarter. This is primarily a function of the weak British pound where we have a major presence. We experienced weakness in military aftermarket and military rotorcraft, bizjets and regional jets, I think pretty much consistent with what you've heard from other companies, and this was offset by strength that we continue to see in commercial transport and also in commercial aftermarket. Orders were up 2% in the quarter on strength in commercial transport, commercial aftermarket, military rotorcraft, biz and bizjets, and this was particularly offset by weakness in military transport, fighters and particularly in NRE, our customer reimbursed engineering expenses. And excluding NRE, orders were actually up 6% in the quarter. So we think that's a really encouraging sign in our Aerospace business, and we continue to see strong margin performance out of the segment with operating margins at 18.5%, or 18.7% when you exclude restructuring costs. And lastly in our Vehicle segment, organic revenues declined 2% in the quarter, largely driven by weakness in NAFTA heavy duty production which was down some 20% in the quarter. You'll recall that in 2016, the year started quite strong and weakened significantly as the year progressed, so the comps do get easier from this point forward. So we'd expect that, relatively speaking, Q1 was our most challenging comparable versus last year. Margins in the quarter were at 13.7%, 14% excluding restructuring, down about 240 basis points from prior year. And while largely consistent with our guidance, margins were below normal for two unusual items. First, I'd say we're ramping up the Procision medium duty transmission, and volumes are not yet at scale. So we're still running some inefficiencies there. And secondly, we did have a warranty issue in the quarter, that also depressed margins. So we'd expect things to improve from this point forward. Page 11 is a summary of the revenue guidance for the year, and as a result of strength that we experienced in Q1, we're increasing our growth expectation in three of our segments, in Electrical Products, Electrical Systems and Services, and in Hydraulics. And in all three businesses, revenues and orders came in above expectations in Q1. We've also generally seen better than expected conditions in a number of the end markets that are important to each of these businesses, and we're increasing, at the midpoint then, our guidance for Electrical Products by 1 point, in Electrical Systems and Services by 2 points, and in Hydraulics by 6 points. Our view is unchanged for the other two businesses. Now these three changes take the midpoint of guidance for Eaton to \u2013 up 2% for the year, 2 points higher than our prior guidance. Now turning our attention to restructuring, we thought it would be helpful to provide a bit more guidance on the pattern of restructuring spending for the remainder of the year, since the pattern of this year's spending is somewhat different than what we've seen in prior years. If you'll recall, we pulled forward $70 million of spending originally planned for 2017 into Q4 of 2016, and that resulted in our Q1 spending being somewhat lower than it would have otherwise been, with a step-up in restructuring beginning in Q2. So we outlined this plan on page 12, our expectations for spending for the entire year. And consistent with prior guidance, we expect to spend $100 million this year, and we'll obtain $155 million of incremental benefits in 2017 over 2016. In Q1, we spent $20 million, modestly below our plan of $26 million, primarily driven by the timing of a couple projects that were shifted into Q2. In Q2, we plan to spend $40 million, with the remaining $40 million for the year planned in the second half. Overall, our restructuring plan remains on track. As we reported earlier, we expect, on an all-in basis, the program to cost $440 million, and to see benefits of approximately $520 million. Page 13 is a summary of our segment margin guidance for the year. In Hydraulics, due to strength that we're seeing in markets and higher volumes that we now expect, we're raising the midpoint of our guidance by 40 basis points. Overall, other than Hydraulics, we think that each of our businesses are within the margin ranges that we guided to for the year. And due to the relative size of Hydraulics business, the change in Hydraulics margins does not change the overall margin guidance for the company for the year. And the other thing I would point out, and as a point perhaps of clarification, as a matter of practice, we would intend to change our margin guidance only when we believe our performance will be outside of the ranges provided, and this holds true for each of the business segments individually and for the company overall. And on page 14, we've provided the customary summary of our guidance for both the year and subsequent quarters and, as we've covered most of these numbers in prior slides, I'll just summarize by indicating what's changed. First, a $0.15 increase in the midpoint of our guidance, with a new range of $4.45 to $4.60, a 2 point increase in the midpoint of our revenue guidance. Also a change from our prior guidance, we think FX will be negative $150 million for the year, and this is down from our prior guidance which was $300 million, and all other items remained unchanged from prior guidance. Turning to Q2, we expect EPS to be between $1.05 and $1.15 with $1.10 midpoint, organic revenue growth to be up 1% to 2%, negative FX to be negative 1.5%, and segment margins between 15.2% and 15.6%. And this does include restructuring cost. And lastly, a tax rate of between 8% and 9%. I'd also note that this guidance does not include any impact from the recently announced JV with Cummins, as we continue to expect that the JV will close sometime in Q3. And lastly, page 15 is a summary of the key points covered in today's presentation. And I'll just close by stating that we're encouraged by the signs of improvement that we're seeing in a number of our end markets, and we generally feel better about growth prospects for the year. We would naturally expect this to translate into higher EPS and that's our expectation, and that's what's reflected in our guidance. Our cash flows remain strong. Our share repurchase plan is on track, as is our restructuring program. So we remain cautiously optimistic that 2017 continues to represent a turning point for a number of our end markets, and a turning point for our company. So I'll stop there and turn it back to Don. Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: The operator is going to provide for us instructions for the question-and-answer session. Operator : Thank you. Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: Our first question today comes from Scott Davis with Barclays. Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. Good morning, guys. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Good morning. Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: So it's nice to see the Hydraulics numbers pick up so quickly, but I have to ask, can you satisfy demand that quickly in a segment you've been restructuring aggressively? I mean, I assume your supply chain as well, and are you comfortable, at least, you can ramp up production fast enough? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yes. I'd say the short answer to the question is Scott, it will certainly take a concerted effort and good execution by our team. But we're ready for this turn. We've been living as you know in down markets in Hydraulics for the better part of three years and so our team is ready, willing and able to take on the volume challenges that we're facing. And so at this point, we're comfortable that Eaton, and we're working obviously through our supply chain to make sure that they're ready as well. But our team is ready for it. Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Fair enough. And just on ESS, when you think about the oil and gas markets, and specifically pointing to commonly oil and gas markets negatively impacting margin. I assume that's a big part of that's Crouse-Hinds. But help us understand the mix of your oil and gas onshore/offshore and if you expect that to come back in 2Q. So I think a lot of your peers have already seen a somewhat meaningful snapback at least in the onshore stuff that's short cycle like that. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Want to take it, Rick? Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yeah. Scott, it's Rick. Our mix historically has been more downstream than upstream and so we aren't as impacted by improvements on the upstream side. We have not really seen our upstream activities accelerate at this point. We're looking for it. We have seen a little bit of improvement in MRO in the harsh and hazardous space and even in the industrial controls that go into some of the onshore rigs particularly. But we have not seen any broad-based pickup yet on the project side. Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Fair enough. Good luck, guys. Thank you. I'll pass it on. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Thank you. Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Evelyn Chow - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Good morning. This is actually Evelyn Chow on for Joe. Maybe just turning to ESS for a second, very encouraging to see maybe some incipient signs of stabilization or recovery. But it looks like the project business hasn't picked up much yet. Does your higher organic guide imply any acceleration there? Or is it sort of flowing through things as status quo? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yes, at this point it does not. I mean, we came into the year with what we'd say is a relatively well-grounded assumption around the way large projects would unfold through for year and to date I'd say it's largely playing out the way we anticipated. So we do not have a return to growth in large projects built into the second half of the year. Evelyn Chow - Goldman Sachs & Co.: That's helpful context, Craig. And then maybe just turning to price costs for a second. Totally understand the dynamic of maybe things normalizing, but in the second half. Just wanted to see how that squared with your previous expectation of about $80 million of material inflation in 2017. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yes, appreciate the question. Certainly, as you pointed out, we did come into the year anticipating about $80 million of let's call it uncovered commodity price inflation that we would experience in the business and we'd indicated that that would be largely a first half issue. And that's largely what we've seen. We saw it certainly come through in Q1. We came into the year with an expectation that commodity prices would start high and we'd see some mitigation in commodity prices as the year unfolded. That is still largely our belief that number one, commodity prices will probably mitigate as the year unfolds, but more importantly, we'll have some time under our belt and we will have essentially been able to offset this commodity price with price increases in the marketplace. And that is largely still our anticipation. It is mostly a second half event and that is the plan that our teams are currently executing towards. Evelyn Chow - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks, guys. Congrats on a good quarter. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Thank you. Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: Our next question comes from Ann Duignan with JPMorgan. Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Good morning. Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc: Hi. Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Could you just give us a little bit more color on the Hydraulics business? On the orders, if you could break out maybe by region, mobile or construction versus ag, mobile versus distribution, and then just around the world. And then a follow-up, Craig, you highlighted the industrial controls, Europe, as up. If you could just give us a little bit more color in that also, I'd appreciate it. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yes, I'd say, Ann, if you think about Hydraulics orders and you obviously know this market well, and what we've seen is largely a relatively pronounced snapback beginning in the Asia-Pacific region, largely in mobile markets. Those markets have been down and down hard over a period of multiple years. And so clearly, the biggest strength that we're seeing today inside of Hydraulics is coming out of the China market and largely coming out of the mobile market on the construction side of the business. But having said that, Europe was also quite strong and stronger than what we anticipated. And there too, a lot of the growth was in the mobile segment. But also we saw strength in the industrial segment as well. And so I would say that in general, the recovery in Hydraulics has been relatively broad-based, but principally led by mobile, construction. But also I'd say equally balanced between what we're seeing today in both the OEM channel and the distribution channel, which we find quite encouraging. We also, in doing a bit of a channel check, we think today that the distribution channel is selling through, that we're not building inventory at this point in the cycle, so we're really encouraged by the outlook, so. Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And then the comment on Europe industrial controls, Craig. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yes, I think we see that more broadly, and as I mentioned in the commentary, what's really changed today in our Electrical Products business is the fact that industrial controls, we're seeing pretty broad-based strength in those markets. And I would argue that a lot of that strength quite frankly that we're seeing in industrial control is a function again of what's happening in the China market. As those markets continue to improve, we see industrial controls in Europe really picking up a lot of that equipment that actually flows into China. But even in the domestic market, we're continuing to see strength in industrial controls. Too early to say exactly how this unfolds longer term, but certainly a pretty broad-based basis of strength around the world in industrial controls in Q1. Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Is that fair to say, Craig, just the ISM PMIs in Europe have been strengthening? I mean GDP in Europe's strengthening. Is that underlying what you're seeing over there? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yes. And I'd say, yeah, we're certainly seeing perhaps even more underlying strength in many of our end markets than the PMIs would suggest, and industrial production would suggest, which tells us perhaps some of that is also tied to what's going on in markets outside of Europe, namely what's going on in China. But in general, what we've seen across each of our businesses, and I think what we've generally seen in industry, is that Europe turned out to be much stronger than most of us anticipated. Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Yes. That's what I was thinking you would say. So I'll get back in line. I appreciate the color. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Thanks, Ann. Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: The next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities : Hi. Morning. Just one more on ESS, I'm afraid. I guess this question would be really around the margin progression through the year. The margins were down a bit in the first quarter with flattish sales, so when you're thinking about your guidance for up margins for the year as a whole, is that because it's what you see in your backlog today, and that gives you six to nine months of visibility? Or is it really just basic stuff around the restructuring charges comp from late 2016, the commodity cost headwind abating in the second half? That sort of thing. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yes. I think, Julian, it's more the latter of that today. We have been undertaking a fairly significant restructuring effort in our Electrical Systems and Services business, and those benefits certainly improve as the year unfolds. Secondly, we talked about the commodity inflation issue that we're dealing with, and so we certainly saw in our Electrical Systems and Services business, like we did for the balance of the company, we saw commodity price inflation that also that we were not able to offset with price increases or other cost-out measures in Q1. And that also begins to mitigate itself as the year unfolds as well. So we think it's largely, those are the reasons why we're confident that our margins will improve in Electrical Systems and Services. And also, volume tends to grow as well, and we tend to be more back end focused from a volume standpoint in Electrical Systems and Services. And that will help margins as well. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities : Thanks. And then just switching over to Vehicles, you had a nice sequential increase in revenue in the first quarter, so back to some kind of normal seasonality, perhaps. Could you discuss a little bit your expectations for the balance of the year in terms of truck versus light vehicle? I think a lot of companies had a very strong first quarter for light vehicle supply chain. To what extent do you think that persists through the balance of the year? And maybe give any color you can on the truck side, the build rate plans of the OEMs? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yes. First maybe on light vehicle markets around the world, and I'd say they continued to perform and hold up very well. And quite frankly, we've been surprising by the size of the strength in certain markets, principally I'd say Europe, where markets were quite strong in Q1. And so at this juncture, we'd say there's no real reason to suggest that light vehicle markets around the world are going to turn out to be any different than what we anticipated when we set our plan for the year, which was to be essentially flat to up slightly. So we remain very much convinced that that forecast will hold to be true. With respect to the NAFTA heavy duty production, I mean right now if you take a look at the production schedule for last year, it was essentially a year where we started quite strong, and we saw weakness in the back half of the year. And today, most of the indicators are that the NAFTA Class 8 market is strengthening. And so we think, as I mentioned in the commentary, that Q1 represented the most difficult comparable where production was down 20%, and we think that things essentially begin to improve from this this point forward. And so our number for NAFTA Class 8 is flat for the year. There are a whole multitude of forecasts out there, some of which are lower, some of which are higher. But we remain convinced that flat is the right call on the North America Class 8 market for 2017. Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc: And Julian, in the context of flat, this is how we think about the market. We think that, or at least ACT data is that production was 51,000 units in Q1, and by the time you get to the back half of the year, we think you're going to see production per quarter in the neighborhood of 60,000 units, and that's how you get to flat. Now, if you actually look at the straight build plans that we collect, they would actually total to a bit more than flat, but we think it's a little early to make that firm conclusion. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: And then the build plan typically is above the market, so it would be very much consistent with pattern historically. Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yeah. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities : Very helpful. Thank you. Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks. Good morning, guys. Just wanted to dig into lighting. Obviously, we've seen a couple of your big competitors in North America report somewhat disappointing trends. Your quarter had low single digit growth, I think, in orders. I'm just wondering if maybe just shine a bit of light on lighting pricing, and maybe the impact on margins this quarter from any price pressure you saw. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yeah, no, what we saw, the way I'd characterize the underlying performance of our lighting business and what we're seeing, Nigel, is this really continues to perform in line with the patterns that we've seen. A lot of lighting, it's going into non-res construction, into commercial buildings. It's going into residential housing. And so we think lighting to be up low single digits is very much in line with what we've seen from the market, and very much what we expect going forward. And if you think about the key industries that essentially drive that market, we don't expect it to perform any differently. To your question around margins, clearly we continue to see the price of LED underlying technologies come down. That's being \u2013 many ways being passed on to the marketplace, and so we continue to get cost out of lighting. That is largely in line with the underlying reduction in the input costs, and our underlying margins overall in our lighting business actually continued to improve. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yes. So I think the NEMA data is calling for lighting to be flat to down this quarter. I think actually down (32:17). Is there anything in your footprint, be it new construction versus replacement, or resi versus C&I, that would explain that performance? Or do you think you're gaining share like-for-like? Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc: Right. If I could just make a comment, Nigel. The NEMA data is not inclusive of the entire market, and so it's a subset of the participants, and so you got to take that data with a little grain of salt. And so, as we create our own index of the lighting market, we use the NEMA data and then we use some estimates of what other participants likely have done, and our belief is that the market is growing in the low to mid single digit kind of category. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: We'd be disappointed if we weren't gaining a little share. That's certainly the expectation. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Right. Okay. That's interesting. And just a couple of quick ones. Rick, why would the second half tax rates be higher? I mean, that's obviously what's embedded in guidance. And then maybe just call out the impact of the warranty true-up this quarter in Vehicle. Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc: The tax rate is, largely this year, a function of the mix, and so as we start seeing seasonally higher growth and also seasonally higher earnings in the U.S., that typically is what pushes the rate up a bit, as well as in Brazil. We expect that economy to improve as we go across the year. So that's the major impact. If you're asking about the \u2013 are you asking? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Warranty. Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc: On the warranty in truck, the Vehicle impact in the first quarter was about $8 million \u2013 let me get you the exact number. $6 million. That was the impact in the first quarter. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. That's great. Thanks. Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Just one little follow-up on lighting. Was there a distinction in your growth rate between non-res and resi, or between large projects and smaller projects on the non-res side? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yes, Jeff. I don't really have the data. I don't believe there was, but we can certainly take that as a follow-up, and Don can follow up with you after the call. But I don't believe that we saw any significant difference in our performance. I mean, large projects in general are pretty much following the pattern that we've seen, and in general, there's fewer very large industrial projects in general. But I'd say that that's not what drives most of our lighting business. It's more the commercial projects and street lighting and resi, and we've not seen, I don't think, any significant difference in the pattern of sales or orders in those segments. Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Okay. Great, and just talk to kind of the margin guide not moving. I'm just wondering if there's some headwind. My rough math, 2 points of organic growth at a 30% incremental is kind of 60 bps of margin, and your margin guide range for the year is 60 bps. So it does seem like the better revenue should have knocked you outside of the range. I mean, maybe 30% incrementals at this sales level is not the right number, or there's something else, but how should I think about that? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yes. I'm not sure what, the calculus that you're doing, Jeff, but in our own calculus, which is reflected in our guidance, we think we are still within the range, and that's kind of the basis for the guidance that we provided. We don't think that the volume changes and the other assumptions take us outside of the range that we've indicated. Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Okay. All right. Thank you. I'll follow up. Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: Our next question comes from Steve Volkmann with Jefferies. Stephen Edward Volkmann - Jefferies LLC : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Curious about your thinking now that Hydraulics looks like it's clearly bottoming and getting better, how do we think about what sort of more normalized margins in that segment might look like given all the cost saves that you've done there? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: What we said, Steve, about Hydraulics is that if you think about this business, we said that we established a range of profitability of 13% to 16%, and we said that even at the bottom of the economic cycle post restructuring \u2013 and I will point out that we're not done with restructuring yet; we still have the balance of 2017 to get through \u2013 is at the very minimum that you could expect this business to deliver at any point in the economic cycle 13%. And we're still very much convinced that that's the case, and then we said from that point forward, you could expect obviously margins to ramp from that point, and you could expect probably pretty good incrementals on that. So at this point, we're not prepared to go outside of those ranges that we've established. We have to, first of all, get into those ranges and demonstrate and prove that we can sustain that, but that's still where we're parked on the business. We think it's 13% to 16% through the cycle. Stephen Edward Volkmann - Jefferies LLC : Okay. Great. And then I think, Craig, you mentioned in the outset that the cadence of the quarter was positive and that March was a big month for you. I don't want to put words in your mouth, but I'm curious as you look at that, it sounds to me sort of across the board that North America was kind of the weaker of all the geographic markets. And I'm curious if you're seeing signs that North America is actually sort of starting to participate in the green shoots that we're seeing here. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: I think it's accurate, first, to say that we definitely saw an acceleration in the rate of growth in the month of March, and that really was pretty much across the board in all regions and in all businesses. But I will say to the point around the U.S. market, the Americas market versus rest of world, I'd say that we continue to see more robust growth outside of the U.S., and that pattern is really I think largely continuing. Stephen Edward Volkmann - Jefferies LLC : Great. Thanks so much. Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: Our next question comes from Chris Glynn with Oppenheimer. Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Thanks. A follow up on tax rate, I think your long-term outlook is roughly for 1 point of increase a year. If the mix progression that you have into the second half outlook holds, would we be looking at a little bit greater magnitude of tax rate increase for 2018? Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc: Wow that's, yeah, I haven't looked at that specifically. I mean clearly, the biggest mover on our rate is the mix, the geographic mix, the two biggest factors being the U.S. and Brazil, which are the countries that currently have the highest tax rate. I don't know what the tax rate is likely to end up with after the administration finishes its work in the States. And so really, that's how I'd have you think about it. To the extent that Europe and Asia continue to grow faster than the U.S., then no, you wouldn't have a negative mix impact on the rate. But if that flips around and the U.S. does start to accelerate, perhaps because of infrastructure programs or a tax cut that causes an increase in business investment, then yes. You might see the rate edge up a little faster. Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thanks. That's helpful. Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: Our next question comes from Andrew Krill with RBC. Andrew Krill - RBC Capital Markets LLC : On the lower restructuring in the quarter, and I guess just specifically, which segments saw less than planned? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Andrew, we didn't catch the first part of your question. Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: Caught that in the middle. Can you repeat it? Andrew Krill - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Sorry. On the, back to the restructuring. Could you give some more specifics on I guess which segments saw less than expected, and if this kind of had anything to do with maybe trying to avoid interrupting any orders on the verge of a possible recovery? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yeah, it's a $6 million delta from the original plan, Andrew. And I'd say that probably most of that delta was in the Electrical side of the house. Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc: Systems and Services. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Systems and Services. Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc: And really, it had to do with projects that we thought could get done but got moved into Q2. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Right. So really, it had nothing do with us interrupting orders. It was simply our ability to kind of get everything done and booked in the quarter. Andrew Krill - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. Got it. And then just kind of with demand seemingly on the verge of a recovery broadly speaking, is there any chance that you may not need to do all the restructuring you currently have planned? Or could that be tamped down? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: What I'd say, a lot of what we're doing, Andrew, as we talked about in the past, is that we're making structural changes to the businesses, things that will fundamentally lower our structural costs inside the company. That doesn't in any way prevent us from flexing our businesses and growing as volumes go up over time. And so, no, we think that this restructuring plan independent of volume is the right plan and really does position our businesses and the company to deliver just higher margins through the cycle and at all points of the cycle. Andrew Krill - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Great. Thank you. Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: Our next question comes from Rob McCarthy with Stifel. Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi. Rob McCarthy here. I guess the first question is just an update on kind of your outlook for M&A as a whole, because I think Craig, when we spoke in the February timeframe, I think you cited expensive valuations across the board. That's continued, and you can see that in kind of the slow rate of global M&A overall. And then I think, Rick, when we sat down, I think there was some ambient concern around, well let's just say, achieving cost synergies, particularly in an environment where it seems globally people are a lot more zealous about protecting the raw material of cost synergies often, which is workers, unfortunately. So could you just talk about how you look at the M&A environment right now? Is it just incrementally worse? And does this kind of push you to really think about doing other things with your cash right now? Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yes. I'll take that, Rob. Clearly, valuations are still high. But of course, earnings growth is accelerating and that is definitely improving over time how you look at these valuations. Secondly, we have seen just in the last several months, we have seen more and more situations where it appears that a sale could be possible. And so we have become more active at looking at opportunities. Hard to know at the end of the day what, if anything, we end up getting done. But as you know, we have had a long history of completing a significant number of acquisitions and we think we're pretty good at it, and so we are now devoting more time to looking at opportunities. To the comment about synergies, it's very hard to tell to what extent there will be any institutional constraints on achieving cost synergies. It does appear that the commentary around that has subsided quite a bit and so we'll just have to look at each situation on its own merits to decide whether we're comfortable with the synergy possibilities. Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then just any kind of, and I might have missed. This might have already been covered in the context of the call, but any update from your perspective on the JV with Eaton Cummins and kind of the messaging there because I think there was an update today. Anything incrementally you want to add on this call? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yes, and I'd say not really. I think we, in the call that we had, we laid out the strategic rationale for the joint venture and we're excited about the prospects that it will add and what it'll do to accelerate the growth rate in our automated transmission businesses. And at this point we do expect that the transaction will close in Q3. There's actually seven antitrust filings that we have to make and that's really the long lead time item that we're working through right now. But we remain optimistic that Q3 is the right timing and we think it really does strategically advantage our transmission business going forward. Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thanks for your time. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Okay. Thank you. Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: Our next question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yes. Good morning. Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: Hi. Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yes, just a question on the Hydraulics business, just a version of normalized margin question. A, do you think you can continue to post positive order growth through the end of the year? And B, if you look at the normalized volume for this business, where are we relative to normalized volume, 80%, 70%, 60%? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yes, Andrew, I think that's the $64,000 question regarding the future and whether or not we're at kind of this key turning point in Hydraulics markets. I can just tell you, based upon history, for those of us who have been around this industry for a long time, you typically go through pretty long upcycles. And all indications are we're at the front end of an upcycle in Hydraulics. And so our expectation would be that orders continue to be positive throughout the balance of the year. But at this point, we think well, let's see how Q2 unfolds. But at this point, we are certainly optimistic that that will be the case. The other half of your question had to do with? Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : No, I think it was sort of where we are relative to normalized volume. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yes. Sure. Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : And just \u2013 yeah, sorry. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: No, I think on that question, I'd say relative to normalized volume, I'd say we're probably still some 25% percent below what we'd call the normalized volume for those markets. And so I think we have a long way to run before we get back to what we'd say would be kind of a normal level of market activity. Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : And just to follow up on Hydraulics, historically you've had very strong exposure to agriculture. Can you provide some color, what you're seeing in those markets and how much is contributing to the order strength? Because I think on the construction, it's more apparent. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yeah. Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yes, we had strong orders in agriculture as well in the quarter, Andrew. But one other comment I might make just to talk about the order pattern across the year, that there is a question of the extent to which the very strong orders in China continue. You probably saw the data. Excavator sales, for example, are up very dramatically and so that is one factor that certainly you could see coming down a little bit. The growth still being very positive, but perhaps not quite as positive as it was in the first quarter. So that's one thing that we're looking out for as the year progresses. Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Thank you. Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: Our next question comes from Andy Casey with Wells Fargo. Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Good morning, Andy. Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: Hi. Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Near term question, and you may have just answered it, Rick, but the Q2 revenue guidance implies, well it includes 1% to 2% organic versus 2% in Q1. Clearly it's slight, but it implies a deceleration. I'm trying to understand the drivers behind that. Is it end market, like the China comment that you just made? Or is it something else, like fewer business days? Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yes, I guess the way I would characterize it, Andy, is that the first quarter rounded up to 2%, but it was between 1.5% and 2%. And so our guidance for Q2 really implies, essentially, very similar kind of organic growth in Q2 to Q1. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: The other thing I would add, Andy, that part of perhaps the hesitancy that you're seeing from us and others is that March was a very strong month, and so that's a real question, to what extent did what we experience in March, was it a function of the fact that Easter fell in April this year versus March, and is there a normalization of what happened in the month of March? And so, at this point, we're a little bit hesitant to make a more robust call, because March was such a big piece of the quarter. Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay, Craig. I'm going to take the bait within that response. It's kind of somewhat related. Eaton has a very diverse view of the U.S. market, and per your comments, March being very strong globally, we've seen some deceleration in PMIs in the U.S. in April. I'm just wondering if the company has seen any similar deceleration in April relative to March? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: No, actually we haven't at this point. I mean the month of April is unfolded largely as we anticipated, but once again, as you can see from our guidance, what we anticipated was a Q2 that would largely look like Q1. Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. And then squeeze one last in. Just a clarification on ESS. Understand large project activity in oil and gas, you called out as remaining weak. Just wondering, within that segment, did any end market demand actually get worse? Or is what we're seeing in that commentary more a function of comparisons? Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc: I would say it's largely a function of comparisons. The three-phase power quality market had had some very large orders in the prior year. And so that, with ESS, you didn't see orders that totally replaced those strong three-phase orders. But other than that, there really wasn't anything that got worse. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Other than perhaps the Middle East was. Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc: Well, okay. Fair. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: We saw some weakness in the Middle East as well. Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yes, which is not a giant part of the business. But clearly in Saudi Arabia, for example, there is some softness. Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you very much. Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: Our next question comes from Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc. Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Hey, guys. Just one more on 2Q guidance. It looks like you're calling for about segment margins to be flat, and you had a good lift in 1Q and your guide has a nice lift. So anything within the 2Q guide, whether it be restructuring, timing, or savings timing, that would support more flattish margins versus the lift? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: The only thing I would say, Jeff, we talked about this issue of commodity prices versus price realization in the marketplace versus other cost out initiatives, and I'd say that's probably the one issue that we continue to work through, that is holding back margins being stronger in Q2. We have a plan. As we mentioned to you, that issue essentially mitigates and solves itself by the time we get to the second half of the year. But that continues to be a pressure point in Q2. Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: And if I could slip one more in, in ESS, you cited the strength in Asia. What's driving that, particularly? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yeah, I'd say we're seeing broad strength across the board in the Asia market. And whether it's the stimulus spending that the Chinese government is pumping into the economy, whether it's the monetary policy, we are generally seeing across the board strength in the Asia market, and tough to tell exactly what's driving it, but it's pretty broad based. Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thanks, guys. Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: Our next question comes from John Inch with Deutsche Bank. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you. Good morning everyone. Hey, Craig, the $80 million of raws headwinds, is there any \u2013 or (54:21) \u2013 is there any way to parse out how much was in the first quarter, and maybe a little bit of color by segment? Or was it more weighted? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: And I would really \u2013 I'd say, rather not parse it. We're seeing it across the board in each of our businesses. The front end of the pressures were probably more electrical-centric. Of late, they're more industrial-centric, but I think we're really seeing it across the board in each of our businesses. And I'd, at this point, as we talked about the absolute size of the number, we said essentially it was about offsetting the restructuring benefits, and so it was certainly a material number. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: And the reason, Craig, we're not raising prices in response is because we expect these costs basically to be transitory, is that how the market thinks? Or is there some other reason? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: No, the way I'd say, the way you should think about it is that we are in fact raising prices, but it takes time, number one. And secondly, one of the big challenges was, as we talked about in the last earnings call and guidance for the year, commodity prices were highly volatile, and up and down from one day to the next, and so you have to get to a period of stability where you actually understand exactly where the commodities are going to settle before you can really have an intelligent conversation with customers around taking prices up. So we had to get to a point of stability before we could actually implement price increases. But, so we're going to, between price increases and other cost-out measures, we'd expect this commodity inflation issue to go away in the second half of the year John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yes, no. That makes sense. By the way, how did within Vehicle, how did auto do? And can you remind us what your auto build assumptions are for the year? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yes. Auto did well by the way and largely on the back of continued strength in China and in surprising strength quite frankly in what we saw in Europe, where the, I read card registrations were up quite nicely in the European market. So I'd say by and large, the market's doing fine. The overall build assumption, we said it would be flat to up slightly. Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc: Flat to up slightly. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yeah. Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc: And that encompassed the U.S. being down just modestly. And so things are playing out, if anything, maybe a little better than we thought because of the non-U.S. production. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: And principally, Europe with more than anything. That's really the market that surprised on the upside in Q1. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yes, no, that makes sense. And maybe then just lastly, there's a lot of attention focused on these oil and gas projects, and you've called out ESS for more than one quarter, right. The question I have is, do you think these, Craig or Rick, do you think these projects can actually come back with oil prices at these levels? In other words, is it a question of just the timing? So oil holds at $50, do the projects actually come back? Or do you need a little bit more of other things to sort of stimulate the activity? And maybe with the answer to that is, the discussions your folks may be having with people in the field, that sort of thing. Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc: Let me take a stab at that. I mean, you have seen over the last couple of months several companies announce fairly significant downstream-type plans, and so I do think some of those projects are likely to move forward. On the upstream side, I think particularly for the very large offshore oil projects, I think that's the area that is not clear. Because unless an oil company really believes that prices are going to sustainably be at least at these levels if not a little bit higher, question, can some of those offshore, which are very big projects, can some of those make economic sense. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: No, that's a fair answer. Thanks very much, guys. I appreciate it. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Thank you. Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: Thank you all for joining us today. With that, I think we're going to wrap up our call. As always, we'll be available to take questions and follow up for the next couple days. Thank you for joining us. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Now, I'd like to turn the conference over to Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Don Bullock. Please go ahead. Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: Good morning. I'm Don Bullock, Eaton's Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you for joining us for Eaton's second quarter 2017 earnings call. With me today are Craig Arnold, our Chairman and CEO and Rick Fearon, our Vice Chairman and Chief Financial and Planning Officer. Our agenda today, as normal, includes opening remarks by Craig, highlighting second quarter performance along with our outlook for the remainder of 2017. As we've done on our past calls, we'll also be taking questions at the end of Craig's comments. A little housekeeping, the press release for today's earnings this morning and the presentation we'll go through have been posted on our website at www.eaton.com. Please note that both the press release and the presentation include reconciliations to non-GAAP measures. A webcast of this call will also be available on our website, and it will be available for replay after the earnings call. Before we get started, I do want to remind you that the comments today do include statements related to future results and are therefore forward-looking. The actual results may differ from those due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties, and those are all described both in the earnings release and in our presentation. Those will also be outlined in an 8-K. With that, I'll turn it over to Craig. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Okay. Hey thanks, Don. Hey, I'll begin by stating that we were pleased actually with our Q2 results, having delivered net income and operating EPS growth of $1.15, at the high end of our guidance for the quarter and a 7% increase versus prior year. And as you know, this was against our guidance of $1.05 to $1.15 a share. Organic growth was up 2%, partially offset by negative FX impacting sales by 1%. Margin performance we think was strong, especially in light of the continued commodity cost pressures that we experienced in the quarter. Operating cash flow of $574 million, and we repurchased $210 million of our shares or 2.7 million shares in the quarter. So, overall, we think strong performance and a good indicator that our strategy is actually working and we're focused on organic growth. We're restructuring our businesses to improve competitiveness and returning cash to shareholders. Page 4 is a look at our EPS bridge from the midpoint of our guidance. Our EPS performance for the quarter, as I mentioned, was $0.05 better than the expected midpoint and at the high end of our guidance. We had higher segment margins. They were up at the upper end of our guidance range, and that contributed $0.03 to higher earnings. We had a combination of higher organic revenues and modestly less negative FX, which combined to yield $0.02 a share. We spent $7 million less on restructuring in the quarter than our outlook at the beginning of the quarter. That added $0.01. And I would say that the lighter restructuring, though you should view as largely timing as a number of projects moved from Q2 into the second half. And lastly, our tax rate was 10%, and this was slightly above the upper end of our expectation for the quarter. And that impacted EPS negatively by $0.01, and that's what yielded the $1.15 a share. Page 5 is an outline of the key financial metrics in the quarter and then variances to prior year, and I'll just highlight a few of these metrics. As previously noted, organic revenues were up 2%. This is actually the same growth that we experienced in Q1 as I mentioned, partially offset by 1% negative FX. Segment profits were up 3% on the 1% increase in revenue. And the way I think about that is really restructuring benefits in the quarter being somewhat offset by higher commodity prices. Margins, excluding restructuring costs in both years, were up 20 basis points, and importantly I think to note, up 140 basis points over Q1 2017. And we think also noteworthy at 16.2% margin excluding restructuring, that's actually a quarterly record for our company. Next, turning our attention to segment results, I'll begin with Electrical Products. Like Eaton overall, organic revenues were up 2% in the quarter, partially offset by a 1% negative FX. Orders in the quarter were up 3% with strength in the Americas and strength in Asia. Margins, excluding the impact of restructuring, were 18.1%, and this was down some 50 basis points from Q2 2016, and I say really driven by two factors. One, we had somewhat higher commodity prices, and you'll see that theme really throughout many of the segments. But in addition to that, we actually had increased R&D investments largely around some of our digitization initiatives. When you compare it to our Q1 2017, margins excluding restructuring costs were actually up 50 basis points, so some sequential improvement in the business. Page 7 provides an overview of our Electrical Systems and Service segment. Revenues in the quarter were down 1%, with organic sales flat and negative FX impacting sales by 1%. And this result is actually identical to our Q1 2017 results. Overall, I'd say industrial activity remains weak with mixed activity across the remainder of what we call nonresidential construction segments. Commercial office growth was up double digit, but at a slow rate of growth than in Q2 than in Q1. And then in April and May, U.S. non-resi put in place spending was actually up less than 1%. So we continue to see sluggish conditions there. Orders in the quarter were down 2%, and I think primarily due to a couple of drivers. One, we had a decline in Europe, largely attributable to weaker orders in the Middle East, and then a large utility order that we had in Asia in Q2 of 2016 really buoyed last year's orders in the quarter that did not repeat this year. Of note, I'd say we are seeing signs of strength in large industrial projects in North America, off of a low base. Orders were up some 25% in the quarter, so hopefully a positive indicator of things turning in North America. Margins were 13.7% and 14.1% excluding restructuring, up 140 basis points versus last year. And excluding restructuring costs in both quarters, margins were actually up 230 basis points over Q1 2017. So the business continues to make progress on expanding margins, largely I'd say on the back of restructuring benefits as markets remain somewhat subdued in the segment. Turning our attention to Hydraulics. This segment continued to see improved market conditions as certainly evidenced by the revenue and the order growth. Organic revenues were up 9% in the quarter, and this is identical to the revenue growth that we experienced in Q1. Order growth in the quarter was actually up 32%, with strength really across all geographies within in both channels with both OEMs and distributors. I'd say orders were especially strong in the Asia Pacific region, where we continue to see a V-shaped recovery in the construction machinery market in China. Margins year-to-year were about flat excluding restructuring costs due to, once again, somewhat higher commodity prices and a bit of business mix. And as noted, we're seeing significant growth in Asia, and the Asia Pacific region is not as profitable as our North America business. Margins excluding restructuring costs also continued to improve sequentially, and they were up 1.2 points over our margins in Q1. So once again, the business is making nice sequential progress. Looking at the Aerospace segment, revenues were down 2%, all driven by negative FX. We did however see strong order growth in the quarter, up some 12%. And the strength was really seen across all major end markets, with the exception of military rotorcraft. Orders for our OEMs were up some 15% in the quarter and aftermarket orders were up 7%, and margins continue to be strong at 18.5% in the quarter. And lastly, in the Vehicle segment, revenues in the quarter were up 2%, with 1% positive from FX. We're also raising our NAFTA Class 8 forecast for the year from 228,000 to 235,000, so up some 3% from our prior forecast and largely because we are seeing improving orders and solid free traffic in North America. Offsetting this improvement however, we have seen pockets of weakness in global light vehicle markets, primarily in North America. As expected, margins in the quarter were down slightly from last year as we continue to ramp our new precision medium-duty transmission. And we do experience in this segment as well some commodity price pressures. Margins sequentially from Q1 were up from 13.7% to 16.4% on both higher volume and incremental restructuring benefit. Page 11 is an updated view of our organic growth outlook, and we did make some minor adjustments to our forecast here. And as a bit of context, perhaps before we get into the businesses, I'd say we're seeing somewhat mixed economic indicators. On the positive side, manufacturing PMIs are strong in the U.S. and in Europe, north of 57 in both cases. U.S. non-defense capital goods orders were also up 4.5% in the quarter and up 2.8% for the year, so perhaps somewhat of a turn there. However, we're also seen pockets of weakness. We're seeing obviously the volatility in oil pricing. We have a lower rate of industrial production growth in both the U.S. and China. The U.S. IP was 1.6% in Q2, and that's down from 2.4% in Q1. And in China, industrial production was also a bit lower at 5%, but once again lower than Q1. And perhaps more thematically globally, large industrial projects remain weak. And taking a look at some of Eaton's specific end markets, in Electrical, I'd say we've seen growth in U.S. nonresidential construction markets, but this growth has deteriorated as we move through Q2. And just taking a look at the C-30 report, in Q1, non-res construction markets were up 3.8%. We don't have the data yet for June. I guess that comes out at around, or I guess it came out at around 10' o clock this morning. But through April and May, it was up only 0.6%. So growth rates for most construction markets are slowing, and growth in the office construction is also beginning to moderate somewhat. Large industrial project activity continues to be weak. The manufacturing category, as a key indicator of the C-30 report showed through April and May, down some 8.5%. We're also seeing somewhat slowing growth in housing starts. Housing starts were up roughly 9% in Q1, and that moderated to about flat, up 0.5 point in Q2. Countering some of that weakness, industrial controls are experiencing improved conditions, we think largely as a function of capital goods spending. But these numbers are up mid single digit for the first half of the year and we think will continue to strengthen. And then lastly in China, China total construction starts are flat year to date. Housing starts are actually up 13% in Q2, but only up 1% year to date, largely on the back of a Q2 decline of roughly 6%. So you can see some mixed signals that we're seeing from the markets overall. Hydraulics as we mentioned, really strength across the board, and we think that strength becomes maintained throughout the year. Aerospace, a little bit once again of mixed signals here. Global commercial aircraft builds are expected to be up modestly for the year. But the first half was, quite frankly, very weak, as you saw from some of our customer data. Commercial aftermarket remains good, we think up mid single digit for the year. And then on the military side, some real weakness that we experienced in the first half of the year. So some uncertainty in the second half, and that's really those factors combined to us reducing our revenue outlook slightly in the Aerospace segment. And then in Vehicle, as we mentioned, taking the forecast up for NAFTA Class 8, but that's offset by a little bit of weakness that we're seeing in global light vehicle markets. And we think the NAFTA forecast now is going to be down 1% to 2%. And we think both China and Europe both coming in slightly below what we anticipated at the profit plan time. Turning our attention to restructuring on page 12, I'd say just an update on from where we sit. We spent $33 million in the quarter, down from $40 million in terms of what we expected. We don't think this has any impact on the year. We fully expect to spend $100 million for the year, and we fully expect to deliver the $155 million of annual benefits. Just a couple of projects that slipped from Q2 into the second half, and so we think this program is largely on track. Turning to page 13, we also are adjusting our full year margin guidance for the segments. Some puts and takes between the segments, but overall for Eaton at the consolidated level, no change. Electrical Products full year margins are being reduced by 30 basis points at the midpoint from 18.6% to 18.3%, and once again largely due to higher commodity costs and as I mentioned, some increased R&D spend around some really important future initiatives that we're investing in. Margins in Hydraulics are increasing by 20 basis points from 11.6% at the midpoint to 11.8%. And then Aerospace margins reduced slightly at the midpoint from 19.4% to 19.0%, largely due to lower volumes, principally in the first half of the year. Turning to guidance on Page 14. We're retaining the midpoint of our full year EPS guidance at $4.60, while narrowing the range from $4.45 to $4.75 to $4.50 to $4.70. As we noted, there's really no change in our organic growth outlook for the year. However, negative FX in 2017 has been reduced from negative $150 million to flat, so a bit of a positive in terms of FX. We're also adjusting our corporate expense forecasts, largely as a result of slightly higher interest expense, pension expense and some other corporate expenses from flat with 2016 to be up $25 million over 2016 levels. And this increase, I said, is really due to three factors, slightly higher pension costs, a little bit additional restructuring in corporate and then slightly higher compensation expenses for the year. The other elements of the full year guidance really remain unchanged. We do estimate these efforts do not include any impact, by the way, from the joint venture with Cummins, which we were pleased to see closed at the end of July. And we'll update our outlook to include the JV at the end of Q3. But as you'll recall from our original announcement, we anticipate it impacting revenues by roughly $25 million in 2017, but not having any material impact on profits for 2017. For Q3, we expect organic revenues to be up 2.5% to 3.5% versus Q3 of 2016. And this is driven by strength in Hydraulics and really easier comps for the rest of the company. Our absolute level of economic activity in Q3, it will be up slightly from Q2. Second, margins are expected to be between 16.2% and 16.6% including restructuring costs. We do continue to experience commodity cost pressures as we move into the second half. And this does include a recent spike that I think many of you are aware of, that we saw in copper prices where copper prices hit $2.90 or so just last week, and that's up about $0.30 from where they'd been running. So we continue to struggle with getting commodity prices to seat at a level that we can essentially plan effectively for. And so we'll continue to face that challenge going forward. And finally, our tax rate is expected to be between 9% and 10%. So just turning to the last page as a way of a summary and wrapping up our comments, I'll leave you with just a few thoughts. Now we see growth stabilizing in many of our end markets. Q3 organic revenue should modestly increase over Q1 and Q2, but once again, largely on easier comps. We'd expect normal seasonal declines as we move into Q4. We did experience some sequential declines in the rate of growth as we moved throughout Q2 across a number of our end markets that I think we've covered. But we do read it to be more of stabilization of growth at current levels versus a deceleration or a further acceleration of growth. Our restructuring programs continue to deliver benefits. We're on track to deliver $155 million this year. And we plan to spend the remaining $47 million of our $100 million restructuring plan in the second half. Importantly, we had planned on having $80 million of unrecovered commodity costs in the first half. And as we expected, commodity prices have subsided somewhat, but certainly not as quickly as we expected. And this will put a little bit of pressure on us in the second half of the year as well. As noted, we've narrowed the range of our full year guidance with the midpoint unchanged at $4.60. We continue to generate strong cash flows and are on track to complete our share repurchase plan. We repurchased $465 million in the first half, with some $285 million remaining towards our $750 million planned purchases for 2017. We closed the joint venture with Cummins for automated transmissions on July 31. And we'll certainly, as I mentioned, provide more details around this transaction during our Q3 earnings call. So I'd just say in closing, looking beyond this year, we really think we're well positioned for continued EPS growth. We're wrapping up the final year of a three-year restructuring plan, spending some $440 million, on track to deliver $520 million of benefits, and once again, structural cost reductions that will contribute to strong margins as we move forward and get a little organic growth behind us. And it does appear, although difficult to predict with any certainty, that growth is stabilizing at current levels. We'll generate significant cash flow that'll allow us to continue to return cash to shareholders in the form of strong dividend yields and share buyback. And this is the third year of our full year $3 billion share repurchase program, and we're on track to complete the committed numbers this year. So I'll stop there and turn it back to Don and be prepared to answer questions. Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: Thank you, Craig. At this point, we'll have the operator provide some instructions for the Q&A session. Operator : Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: Our first question comes from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hi, good morning. I guess my first question would be around margins. So the operating margins ex restructuring were down in four out of the five segments year on year. And also you talked about some slowdown in certain end markets during Q2, so I wondered why you're not planning to step up restructuring materially, if the top line growth is leveling out here and margins are down in most of your segments? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yes, I'd say Julian, the way I would think about margins is we are largely on track in terms of the margins expectations. As we look forward, we're in a little bit of a transition period today as we're experiencing commodity price volatility. And in this highly volatile market, trying to peg the right point of how do you offset that with a combination of cost out and passing it forward into the marketplace has been a little bit of a challenge. But if we think about the margin progression for the company and for our businesses overall, we think we're largely on track to deliver what we've committed. With respect to restructuring, as you're well aware, we had a pretty sizable restructuring program that we're working through today. And it's going essentially well, and our businesses are delivering. I think whether or not that plan gets bigger or not, I think really becomes a function of what we see in the outlook. And at this point, we do think our markets are returning to stable growth, not breakaway growth, not the kind of V-shaped growth that we're experiencing in Hydraulics. But we do think we're going to be looking at a period of stable, predictable growth. And so we don't necessarily believe, barring unusual events, that the company needs to launch another very large restructuring program. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Understood. Thank you. And then just my last question on the operating cash flow, that was down, I think mid single digits or so in the first half. The year is guided to grow, so you've got a decent sort of I think mid teens growth or so in the second half dialed in. Some of that I guess is coming from net income or EBITDA growth accelerating. But is there anything happening special on the CapEx or working capital side that gets that operating cash flow sort of back up year-on-year? Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yes. Julian, it's Rick. Let me give you a little perspective on that. If you look at our operating cash flow for the first half of 2017 compared to the first half of 2016, and if you'll recall, we put $100 million into our pension plan in the first quarter of this year. We didn't do that last year. Our operating cash flow is almost identical. In fact, it's up a little bit in the first half of 2017, if you take out that pension contribution. So really what happened is we had extraordinarily strong cash flow in the first quarter. It was up about $90 million over the prior first quarter. And in the second quarter, we've given some of that back. And the reason we've given it back is really two reasons. One, we've had a different pattern of growth this year. And so we had to put more money into working capital in this second quarter. So we had strong growth from Q1 to Q2, and we're seeing growth into Q3. And if you'll recall last year, we actually had a sales decline from Q2 to Q3. And then the second reason is that we did have some expense, some cash usages in the second quarter of this year that were in other quarters last year. And there were two principal ones. We had a debt maturity right at the start of July. And so we, because of the way the calendar fell, we ended up making the interest payment in the second quarter of this year. Normally, that would have been in the third quarter. And then we also ended up making the rebate payment on our electrical distributor program in April, and it occurred in March of last year. And so those things are simply slight movements between quarters. And so we're confident as we look at our operating cash flow forecast that we're still on track to hit that. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thank you very much. Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: Our next question comes from Ann Duignan with JPMorgan. Christie Wei - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi, guys. This is Christie Wei on for Ann Duignan. Can you discuss Hydraulics demand by end market? You mentioned you saw strength in construction in China, but what are you seeing in other markets as well? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yes, I mean, what we're really seeing I think mostly is a pretty broad-based improvement in our Hydraulics business. We're seeing certainly kind of the V-shaped recovery that I mentioned in China construction. But more systemically, we're seeing really increases in all regions of the world. And we're also seeing increases really in both mobile equipment and stationary equipment and then across both construction and ag. And so what we've really experienced I'd say mostly is a pretty broad-based recovery in most of the hydraulics markets and a really outsized V-shaped recovery in China construction. Christie Wei - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Thank you. Good morning everyone. Craig or Rick, I suppose you just explored a little bit more corrective actions you might be trying to take on price costs. I guess that would particularly play to pricing. We've seen in our survey results that it's tough to get pricing near term. But what actions are you taking and how do you see this playing out in the back half of the year? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yes, so I'd say, I'll take the question. This is Craig. But certainly when we came into the year, it was our anticipation that we'd have roughly $80 million of timing of unrecovered costs that would flow through the business. And it was our original anticipation that commodity prices would start high, and then we'd see them essentially retreat a little bit as the year unfolded. And in fact, that's largely what has happened. Unfortunately, it hasn't happened to the extent that we anticipated. And then on top of that, we're ending up with these extraordinary events where you see spikes in various commodities essentially driven largely by maybe geopolitical factors and I'll cite copper as a prime example, where copper prices spiked last week due to not necessary a supply/demand issue, but more of a more political kind of issue around China. And so I'd say with that backdrop, we've tried to get out in front of this in general with kind of our view of the world and anticipate where commodity prices were going and working with our customers around efforts to recover these cost increases, and obviously working on a plan to mitigate some of it through cost out, and, but it's really our ability to call the exact timing on when things stabilize that's created the issue for us. But, the way I think about it is largely a timing issue. We'd had hoped that by time we hit Q3 and the second half of the year, that we were essentially balanced, that we'd fully recovered all of the commodity price increases. And we think at this point, we may be a quarter or so off, given some of the recent events and some of the slower retrenchment in some of the key commodities that we're buying. But we think once again longer term, as you think about kind of the implications is that, we will be able to offset via price and/or cost out measures the commodity price inflation that we're experiencing, and we're dealing with a bit of a timing issue today in our businesses. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Great. Thank you. And then I was wondering if you could unpack a little bit within the Electrical pieces, some of the larger end markets within EP, a little color on how lighting did. And then also curious on ESS, we saw some constructive commentary out of Schneider on data centers and Hubbell on utility T&D in the U.S. Maybe a little bit of color on how those markets are doing, or how they performed in the quarter. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yeah, I'd say that for us, again just kind of a walk-through some of the major end markets. You mentioned utilities, we'll start there and we're saying generally speaking, the utility markets is, those markets continue to run a little bit better than flat, up slightly from kind of prior year, but not kind of in any way or shape a breakaway performance. But we are calling them, as when we set our plan for the year was that those markets would be flat to up 1% or 2%, and I would say that they're performing largely in line with that. Residential markets for us continue to do well, so residential construction, a little bit of a watch out in terms of housing starts in Q2. But by and large, residential products for us continue to do well, and we think that market continues to be positive for the year. A little bit of a turnaround on the positive side for us is industrial controls. That market certainly strengthened in Q2, and we think that's perhaps the beginning of a trend. Too early to call it, but we think that market continues to do well. The light end of commercial continues to perform well, a little bit of retrenchment from some really strong numbers that the market posted in Q1, but that market continues to grow mid single digit. And so we think light commercial continues to be positive for the business. The concern or the challenge continues to be in the large assemblies in the large projects. And that market, we really have not seen any material improvement when you think about the business around the world. A little bit of strength perhaps in North America, but that strength was really more than offset by weakness in Asia and Europe in the region. So in total, that business has really not recovered to any significant extent and continues to run, quite frankly, significantly negative year over year. Lighting, that market I'd say in the quarter, a little bit weaker than Q1. And we'd anticipated that that market would weaken up a little bit, and it did. We think longer term, we think lighting continues to be a positive market with mid single digit growth prospects, but it certainly was weaker in Q2. You saw where some, I've referenced some of the light commercial projects in the quarter that perhaps were the underlying factor. But we think long term, lighting continues to be positive. And our outlook for the year really hasn't changed from when we set our original planning guideline. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Thanks. Was the lighting down for the quarter? And I'll pass it with that. Thank you. Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc: Lighting was relatively flat for the quarter. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Thank you. Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: Our next question comes from Tim Thein with Citigroup. Tim W. Thein - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Great. Thank you. Craig, maybe just to follow up on that last comment there. In terms of systems and services and as part of the Analyst Day earlier this year, again looking further out to 2018 and beyond, you did cite that at least the expectation at the time that you would start to see some of those large industrial projects and oil and gas activity start to come back. Is what you've seen since then and just given your conversations with your major customers, does that give you pause in terms of that expectation? I'm not of course looking for 2018 guidance, but maybe just a little bit more context there. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yes. No, I think these markets are always difficult to predict when the exact turn will occur. As I mentioned in my opening commentary, we were encouraged by the fact that our U.S. business, the North America business, showed very strong order growth in Q2. And so we still believe that, that market is poised for a recovery. We think oil and gas markets certainly will begin to pick up and already have picked up. And so no, our view from a 2018 perspective remains unchanged. And we do think that that business sees positive growth in 2018. And some of the early indicators we think are supportive of that. Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc: And Tim, it's Rick. We did see some good orders in midstream oil and gas in the second quarter. So again, a glimmer that things are starting to improve, but it's really the very large type projects that still haven't really started to accelerate. Tim W. Thein - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Got it. Okay. And then just on products, given the order strength you've seen for a couple of quarters now in Asia Pacific, does that pose any kind of regional headwinds in terms of from a margin standpoint to the extent that you are seeing faster growth in Asia? Would that put any pressure on kind of the flow-through, or is that not significant? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yes, what I'd say, your supposition is generally true that most of our North America businesses are more profitable than our businesses around the world. But, and we're seeing a little bit of that dynamic in the Hydraulics business where we simply have a relatively speaking larger business in Asia. But I would not anticipate any material impact in Electrical from the relative growth patterns in Asia. Tim W. Thein - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay, thank you. Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good morning. Just wanted to go back to the price cost. And Craig, you mentioned that you may be a quarter behind on the timing there. So maybe just comment on the $80 million, where that stands today, and is the bulk of that slippage in Electrical Products or is it a bit more than that? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: We've actually, if you take a look at the basket of commodities that are important to our company and you go commodity by commodity, and I'd say almost every commodity today that we purchase is at a higher level than what we originally anticipated. And so I think it's a pretty broad-based commodity challenge across most of the baskets of commodities that we buy as a company. So it's pretty broad-based. And I'd say with respect to the timing, for us what we need and I think what everybody needs in these conditions is you need a period of stability where you actually know where these commodities are going to land. It's very difficult in an environment where commodities continue to bounce around, to go out to put a plan together to offset and have intelligent conversations with your customers. And so as I mentioned, we'd hope that we'd have behind us by time we hit the midpoint of the year. And we do think that it's going to be, it will take us another quarter before we are able to really get to the point where we're offsetting the inflation that we're seeing. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. But if we're trying to bridge between the previous guidance and where we are now, do we put in $120 million of unrecovered raw material inflation? I'm just trying to size the impact. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yes it's, what I would suggest is if the exact number, we haven't necessarily quantified in terms of the impact. But if you think about order of magnitude, $80 million, $40 million a quarter, that kind of what's baked into the guidance that we provided. So it's fully baked into the guidance. And I think what you see when you look at our sequential incremental margins from one quarter to the next, I think yeah, I think you can see the evidence of the fact that we are in fact offsetting it. We are in fact recovering it in our sequential incremental performance. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And then just a quick one on truck guidance. Does the outlook for margin, the 14.8% to 15.4%, does that bake in the impact of the Cummins JV? I'm just wondering if the unchanged guidance is apples to apples. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: So our truck guidance, we actually, you say it's baked in to what? I am sorry what was the front end of the question? Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Because I think the nature of the JV is that it's revenue dilutive and margin accretive. I'm just wondering if the JV, if the guidance, the unchanged guidance is apples for apples. Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yeah, it doesn't really have much impact, Nigel, because it's only a $25 million reduction of revenue and virtually no change in profit. So it's not really significant to the overall margins. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: But we have not updated the guidance specifically for the impact of the JV at this juncture. We intended to do that at the end of Q3. Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc: But it shouldn't have a significant impact. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Understood. Thank you very much. Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: Okay. Our next question comes from Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc. Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Hey, guys. Just on the price side of this kind of price/cost dynamic, are you seeing any areas where you're struggling to get price? You've had some peers kind of talk about that. And then any areas where you're kind of going for another bite at the apple in terms of price? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Jeff, what I'd say is that I'm not going to talk about specific customers or business in terms of what our exact pricing plans are. But suffice it to say that to the extent that we are experiencing more commodity price inflation in our businesses than we originally anticipated, and we don't have clear line of sight to other measures to offset it with cost reductions, that the intention would be to go out and recover it in the marketplace. And that's fully our expectation that through the cycles of commodity prices up and down that commodity costs are neither a headwind nor a tailwind to our business. Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. And then can you just speak to what you're seeing on the auto side of the business. There's been some mixed SAAR data, and I notice you raised truck, but kind of left the overall unchanged. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yeah, and it is to your point, it's really the weakness that we have seen in global light vehicle markets around the world. And that's really the offset to the strength that we're seeing in the North America Class 8 truck market. But we've seen the weakness largely around the world with the exception of let's say of Latin America, which is too small to matter. But North America, even China, European car productions, all of these metrics are running slightly below our original plan for the year. Not dramatically, but enough to offset the strength that we're seeing in North America Class 8 truck. Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thanks, Rick. Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc: Thank you. Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: Our next question comes from Chris Glynn with Oppenheimer. Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: ...transcript, but on the tax rate, it looks like we're backing into a bit of a spike, maybe 12% plus in the fourth quarter. Is that accurate? Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc: Right now, Chris, we anticipate the tax rate will be higher in the fourth quarter than the third quarter. Obviously there's a range, and I'm not going to leave a precise guidance right now. But yes, we do think that for a variety of discrete item reasons, that it'll be slightly higher. Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Okay, thank you. Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: Okay, our next question comes from Andrew Obin with BofA. Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi, guys, good morning, guys. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Good morning. Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc: Hi. Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Just sort of bigger picture question. When Eaton was put together, the idea was to put a multi-industrial company. And if I look at the organic growth last quarter, if I look at the organic growth this year, and if I look at sort of your multi-industrial peers that don't necessarily have big oil and gas exposure, we sort of have a number this quarter organic growth, 3.5% to 4%. Last quarter also seems your 2% was good, but towards the lower end of your peer group. I was just wondering, as you look at the portfolio and if you look at the organic growth, is there one particular market that you feel is holding you back or does it just come down to these large projects on ESS? Is that what's holding you back? I'm just trying to understand how I should think about structural growth for Eaton in this environment relative to your peer group. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yes, I'd say, Andrew, that the kind of thesis around the collection of the company and then our broad exposure to very thin markets is in fact the right one. And, but many of our businesses, I'd say more than anything are really tied to industrial production. It's one indicator of kind of the underlying growth prospects for many of our businesses. It's really what's going on with industrial production. And industrial production really over this period has been quite muted, growing sub 2%. And so I think if there's one indicator, yes, many different businesses tied to different end markets, but many of the same characteristics. And I'd say that we too have been disappointed that industrial production hasn't grown faster. And in any given year, there's been different reasons and different things that have fallen out of bed. But certainly, we like you have been concerned that we haven't grown faster over the last four years or so. Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : No, I understand it's a focus for you guys. Another question on Aerospace, just you're sort of citing defense headwinds in the second half. I think one of the larger themes at the Paris Air Show was that defense spending actually looks better for the second half, because of all the allocations that already taken place. Is it a specific program? Just want to get more color what's happening in Aerospace in the second half in the defense side. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yeah, no, I mean I think in our case, what we've said with respect to defense spending is that we really haven't seen it yet. There's been a lot of discussion about appropriations, about fleet readiness. But what we've said is that we really haven't seen it. It didn't show up certainly in our order book in the first half of the year. And we're optimistic that it will come. There's a real need, but we've not yet seen it show up in our order book, and that's the reason for the caution with respect to our outlook. The other piece of our outlook that's not just defense, but also through the first half of the year, commercial aircraft shipments ran at relatively subdued levels. You obviously track the Boeing and Airbus deliveries, and those deliveries were certainly below what our expectations were through the first half of the year. So it's, yes, it's military defense, but there was also a little bit of weakness in commercial deliveries as well in the first half of the year. Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Terrific. Thanks a lot. Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: Okay. Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hey, good morning, guys. Maybe just kind of following along Andrew's question there. Craig, when I think about your businesses, there's got to be certain businesses, from a structural perspective, that you feel like have more competitive mode, better pricing power than others. And I guess, how are you thinking about that across the portfolio and the potential to do something with the portfolio in the future? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yes, Joe, I'd say that we think about each of our businesses, it is our expectation that every one of our businesses, through a combination of our ability to pass through price in the marketplace and our ability to offset it through various internal productivity measures, that every one of our businesses have the ability and are expected to offset commodity price inflation. Our businesses in some cases are structured differently to do it. In many cases, we have contracts with customers that allow us to pass on commodity price increases based upon a formula. Those formulas work in both directions. And in other cases, it is a negotiation. And one of the bigger challenges that we have, as you can appreciate, is in our large project businesses. And so in businesses like Electrical Systems and Services where you are working off of a very large backlog, it does take time to pass through price increase. But we firmly believe that every one of our businesses have plans and are certainly expected to offset, through time, any inflationary pressure that they experience in their businesses. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: That makes sense. I guess whenever there's any discussion around the portfolio, I feel like the focus tends to go right to Vehicle and maybe to a lesser extent Hydraulics. But I guess one of the major changes that's kind of happening over the next few years in the aerospace industry is what Boeing has been saying about their opportunity to really increase their services revenues moving forward. How are you guys thinking about that potential threat to your business and your ability to extract pricing? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yeah, I'd say Aerospace, the dynamics are in many ways different than many of our businesses. And the thing that gives us a lot of confidence in our ability to maintain value and margins in Aerospace is the intellectual property around the components that we've developed that are on these aircraft, we own the IP. And so we will continue to work with Boeing and Airbus and others in terms of helping them in their endeavors to participate more fully in the aftermarket. But at this point, we're very confident in our ability to maintain our margins in Aerospace based upon our IP position and our position on the platforms that we're flying on. It's always a challenge and it's never easy. But our teams are very confident in our ability to continue to be paid for the value that we generated when we put our parts on these platforms and our ability to hold on to it. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Fair enough. Thanks guys. Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: Our next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you. Good morning everyone. Hey, you called out some additional spending in digital and R&D. Can you give us a sense of what areas specifically, any expected paybacks or augmenting products, software-as-a-service and so forth? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Hey Deane, the primary spending, though we're spending really across our entire business in and around digitalization. And for those of you who had an opportunity to attend our Analyst Day at our Pittsburgh facility had an opportunity to see firsthand some of the technology that we're investing in. So we're really spending pretty broadly across the company. The places where we've accelerated our investment and are spending more than what we originally anticipated is largely in our Electrical Products segment. And as we've said before, some of the spending will certainly fall into the category of you have to be ready, you have to be capable. And then in others are places where we're really in the midst of really developing what we think are unique and compelling value propositions around digitalization. Lighting is one great example of where we think today, we have a real value to sell and we think we can ultimately be paid for it. But these are largely upfront investments in core technology and core capability that essentially will have paybacks more in the medium term than in the near term. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Got it. And then as a second question, are you seeing any what you would describe as channel disruptions from e-commerce, maybe on the electrical side, business shifting away from some of the traditional distributors? Anything that you can comment there? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yeah, no, the Amazon kind of factor is certainly out there. There's lots of discussions taking place. And lots of our distributors are looking at things that they're doing and investments that they're making to developing similar capabilities. And so for us, it's one that we continue to watch. And we recognize that many of our distributors see a potential threat and are working earnestly towards figuring out things that they're doing in and around their own business models to maintain competitiveness. One of the big advantages we think we have and one of the reasons we don't believe necessary that the Amazon threat becomes a significant threat in the electrical channel, is a lot of what we do is obviously safety driven and highly specified. And so the products that we're selling are not off-the-shelf commodities that are simply plug and play. They're typically highly specified. And when things don't work properly, lives are at stake. And so we think there is a measure of protection. But having said that, it is certainly something that we continue to watch and our distributor partners continue to watch. And they are making really sizable investments in having Amazon-like capabilities around delivery, which they should do. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : That's helpful. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Andy Casey with Wells Fargo. Jorge Baptista Pica - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hey, good afternoon. This is Jorge Pica on for Andy. Just two small mix questions. On that North American industrial projects growth, would you say the bulk of that was midstream oil and gas? I know you mentioned that previously. What end market was driving that 25% order growth? Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc: It was a mixture of some was midstream oil and gas, some were more general medium sized industrial projects, even some switch-gear into utility applications. So it covered a variety of end markets. Jorge Baptista Pica - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay, perfect. And then would you say that that is similar to the Hydraulics comment that you made earlier on ag in construction? Was that kind of a 50/50 growth split between the two areas on Hydraulics? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: No, I'd say in terms of Hydraulics, given the China outsized V-shaped recovery that we were certainly seeing bigger numbers on the construction side of the business than we are on the ag side of the business, but having said that, we are seeing growth in both segments. Jorge Baptista Pica - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. And then I guess the last question is, can you describe what your end market exposure is on military aircraft, fighters versus rotorcraft? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yes. No, I'd say that today, we have a presence on just about every military platform. Our business today is 60% commercial and 40% military. And today we have a very strong position on both rotorcraft and fixed wing fighters and transport. So today, we are very well positioned from a share standpoint on the military side of the house. And quite frankly, if you think about the new military platforms and programs, the F-35 and the like and CH-53 heavy lift, some of the bigger programs of the future, we actually have more content than ever on those new and emerging platforms. And so we're very well positioned in military. Jorge Baptista Pica - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay, perfect. Thank you. Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: Our next question comes from Rob McCarthy with Stifel. Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi. Good morning everyone. I guess the first question I would have is just given the growth you've been seeing right now and kind of the commentary around channels and some of the risk you've been assessing, how would you think about the M&A environment right now? And could you comment on the balance sheet, your cash generation and kind of your capital allocation priorities? Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yes. We are clearly interested, Rob, as we've said, of getting back into an M&A mode, which we were out of during the years of Cooper integration. And because of that, we have spent a lot of time in the last three to four months systematically targeting areas and systematically starting to rebuild our pipeline of likely candidates. The environment I think is a challenging one right now. As you know, multiples, by most people's estimations are above average. And as you've seen, the prices paid in many of the acquisitions that have been announced, they've been very high. And so I think those of you who know us over a great many years know that we have been very disciplined in how we purchased companies, and we intend to remain disciplined. And so with the caveat that the environment is a trickier one than it sometimes is, we would hope that we would make some good progress over the next 12 to 18 months in hopefully achieving some acquisitions. The areas that we focused on are still the same, namely Electrical, and we also believe there may be some select opportunities in Aerospace. But those are the two industries that we've been spending most of our time on. Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: And as a brief follow-up, I mean I think it goes without saying, there's been a widespread disappointment with just policy traction with this administration, to say the least. I mean I know we're not getting 2018 guidance, we're not. And we've talked about kind of the organic growth rate, what we've seen. But is there anything to give you enthusiasm that we're going to see anything from Washington that would create an environment where we could see a return for you guys to mid single digit organic growth in 2018? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: I think to your point, difficult to really take much to the bank in terms of what we've heard from the administration to-date in terms of their ability to get legislation through. But certainly, there's a number of things that are being talked about that would be very positive for our company. Certainly, if we can find our way towards putting together an infrastructure bill, that would be very positive for Eaton, and something that we think, quite frankly, you would have bipartisan support on. As you think about what's going on in the world of tax, as you obviously know, Eaton has a very low tax rate already, but it would obviously be very positive for many of the end markets that we sell into. And I think more than anything, what we need is we need predictability. And I think in this environment of uncertainty, especially in the context if you think about making investments in large projects, large industrial projects, when you're trying to make an investment, a multi-year, in some cases, $1 billion investments into an environment of uncertainty, it simply freezes the investment community. And so I think more than anything, what the business community needs is some certainty around what the policies will be. And I do think that in some cases, there's pent-up demand and folks who are waiting to make a decision, pending the outcome of a lot of these potential changes in policy and other initiatives. And so we think on balance, we think there's more upside than downside in the event that the administration can get through some of these initiatives that they've been advocating for. But as you've seen, like we, it's very uncertain in terms of whether or not you're going to get kind of the type of bipartisan support that you need and cross the aisle kind of compromise that we need to get the country moving again. Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thanks for your time. Operator : The next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with Wolfe Research. Josh Pokrzywinski - Wolfe Research LLC : Hi, good morning, guys. Thanks for fitting me in here at the tail end. Just on ESS, I think there was bigger, or a step up in margins in the second half. Could you maybe square that away with the order intake that you had in North America this quarter, the up 25%? Is that some indication about how backlog margins are looking? And then a follow-up on how we should think about that. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: I think the way to think about the step-up in margins in ES&S, not only between the first half and second half, but very much evidenced in Q1 versus Q2, is that we're doing a fair amount of restructuring inside of the Electrical Systems and Services business, and those restructuring benefits are paying off. And so as we think about the first half versus second half, we're really not counting on any significant change in business mix to drive the improvement in profitability. A little bit of volume, but mostly, it's a function of just the restructuring benefits coming through. Josh Pokrzywinski - Wolfe Research LLC : And then I guess just on the backlog margins, Craig, we've heard from anyone who participates a large project that they're still in a flat capacity where pricing hasn't really picked up. Is that consistent with what you guys have seen? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Pricing is clearly always a challenge in large projects and project businesses in general. And I think until you get into an environment where you have more volume and more demand in the system, you're going to continue to face challenges around projects and decisions being made that essentially keep some of those businesses under pressure. Josh Pokrzywinski - Wolfe Research LLC : That's fair. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: But that's all really factored in quite frankly into our forward guidance. And we're comfortable that the guidance that we provided is very much reflective of that reality. Josh Pokrzywinski - Wolfe Research LLC : That's good color. And just one more. I know you don't want to get in too deep into 2018, but any comments on how we should think about where Eaton is hedged or has purchases locked in, and how maybe the raw material climate shifts as we flip the calendar? Are you guys basically at spottish rates today and does that change as we get here closer to 2018? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yes, the way I would think about it for our company in general is that we certainly do some hedging. And, but the way we think about hedging in general, it's kind of a bridge to a permanent answer. And so hedging is never going to be a permanent solution to deal with commodity fluctuation. Ultimately, you have to get price or you have to get costs out of your business. And so we do hedge. But once again, it's a temporary fix. It's not a permanent fix. And ultimately speaking, our expectation is that we have to recover it in the marketplace or we have to get costs out of the company. Josh Pokrzywinski - Wolfe Research LLC : Great. Thanks for the color, Craig. Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: It looks like it's a little past the top of the hour, so at this point, I think we're going to wrap up the formal portion of our call. We'll be available for question and answers for those on the call or those that are interested after the call and for the remainder of the week. Thank you very much for joining us today. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, it does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T TeleConference. You may now disconnect.",

Welcome to the Eaton third quarter earnings conference call. Also as a reminder, today's teleconference is being recorded. At this time, we'll turn the conference over to your host, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Don Bullock. Please go ahead, sir. Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: Good morning. I'm Don Bullock, Eaton's Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you for joining us today for Eaton's third quarter 2017 earnings call. With me today are Craig Arnold, our Chairman and CEO, and Rick Fearon, our Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer. The agenda today, as is typical, includes opening remarks by Craig highlighting our performance in the quarter, the third quarter, and our outlook for the remainder of 2017 and some preliminary comments or thoughts as we look into 2018. As we've done in the past, we'll be taking questions at the end of Craig's comments. Before I turn it over to Craig, a couple of issues. First, I'd like to note that the press release for today's earnings this morning and the presentation we'll go through were posted on our website at www.eaton.com. I'd ask you to note that both the press release and the presentation do include some reconciliations to non-GAAP measures, and the webcast for today's call is accessible through our website and will be available for replay after the call. Before we get started, I do want to remind you that our comments today will include statements related to expected future results of the company and are therefore forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ from those from a wide range of risk items and uncertainties that we describe both in the earnings release and in our 8-K. With that, I'll turn it over to Craig. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Hey, thanks, Don. Hey, if you had a chance to read obviously our results this morning, and so we delivered what we think are very solid Q3 results. Reported EPS was $3.14, and this included $1.89 gain from the formation of the Eaton Cummins joint venture. Excluding the gain from the joint venture, operating EPS was $1.25, and this included some $13 million or a $0.03 impact from the natural disaster, so up 9% over Q3 2016. Sales were $5.2 billion. That's up 4.5% in total, of which 3.5% was organic, and we had a 1% positive contribution from FX. The 3.5% organic growth was at the top end of our guidance range. And we reported segment margins of 16.4%, an all-time record for the company, up 80 basis points from Q2 2017. And adjusting for $11 million of restructuring costs in the segments, margins were 16.7%. And I also would add that margins were reduced by another 20 basis points in the quarter as a result of the recent natural disasters, and so really a strong quarter of operating results for the business. In addition, we had exceptionally strong cash flow in the quarter. Adjusted for the unplanned Q3 pension contribution, operating cash flow was just over $1 billion, once again, a quarterly record for the company. Also of note in the quarter, we refinanced $1 billion of debt that was maturing in November, and we're very pleased with the attractive rates that we've achieved. $700 million was financed with a 10-year tenor at 3.1%, and we had $300 million of 30-year debt at 3.9%. We also took advantage of the very strong cash flow and we decided to contribute $250 million to our U.S. qualified pension plan, which is now funded at 94%. Lastly, given the share price volatility that we saw during the second quarter, we repurchased $324 million of our shares in the quarter at an average price of $73.29. This brings our total repurchases to $789 million for the year, and this compares to our original target of $750 million. Turning to page 4, it provides a simple bridge explaining our EPS performance for the quarter. Compared with the midpoint of our operating EPS guidance of $1.25, we delivered $1.25. Better organic growth delivered a $0.02 improvement and better FX delivered $0.01. These two positives were offset by the negative $0.03 impact from the hurricanes and earthquakes, as we had previously announced on October 10. In addition, we closed the Eaton Cummins joint venture in the quarter for an after-tax gain of $843 million or $1.89 per share. This gain was derived from both selling 50% of the business and revaluing the remaining 50% interest that we hold. Adding the $1.89 from the gain on the sale plus $1.25 operating EPS is how we got to our reported EPS of $3.14 per share for the quarter. Turning to our financial summary on page 5, I'd just point out a few items not previously discussed. First, the 3.5% organic growth is really our best result in 11 quarters, so we're really pleased with the fact that the businesses are starting to inflect positively in many of our markets around the world. And despite commodity cost headwinds, we did improve segment margins by some 40 basis points year on year. And when you're adjusting for the impact of restructuring costs, segment margins continue to improve year on year. In the quarter, they were up 20 basis points over Q3 2016 to 16.7% and up 40 basis points when you adjust for the natural disasters. Moving to segment results, we'll begin with Electrical Products. Revenues were up 5%, 4% on organic growth with 1% positive FX. And we saw notable strength in the Americas; industrial controls, commercial and residential products. Europe was stronger really across all geographies, and in Asia-Pacific, power quality across the region. Bookings were up 5% in the quarter, on strength once again in all regions. Bookings improved from both Q1 and Q2, where they were up 3%. And I would note that we also have particular strength in Central and Eastern Europe, which was up over 20%, transportation products was up high teens, commercial components up mid-teens, Canada and Latin America were up low teens, and residential in the U.S. was up high single digit. Profits were at 18.7%, or 19.2% when you adjust for the $11 million of impact that we experienced from the natural disasters in this particular segment. Our facilities in Puerto Rico are actually making good progress. We have four facilities on the island, all of which are back in operations. We're back on grid power in two of our facilities, two still running on generators, but we have plenty of access to fuel to keep those facilities producing. And in fact, production at most of our facilities is now running at pre-hurricane levels as we work to make up lost production. We do expect a reduction in Q4 profits in this segment of another $8 million as a result of air freight, cleanup costs, and overtime labor that we're running in our facility, but we don't expect this problem to linger into 2018. And in fact, while difficult to size at this point, as the building process begins in earnest, we do expect to see a positive impact on sales in 2018. Moving to Electrical Systems and Services, revenues were down 1% in the quarter, 2% organic, offset by 1% of positive FX. We experienced weakness in large assemblies in the Americas and in power quality, but growth in engineering services and power systems, and notably first signs of improvement in the Crouse-Hinds harsh and hazardous business. Bookings were down 1% in Q3, and this compared to being flat in Q1 and down 2% in Q2. The reductions were primarily the result of weakness in both the utility and data centers in Asia-Pacific and large projects in the UK and Middle East. The good news in this segment is that we're beginning to see signs of improvement in large assembly orders in the U.S., which is an important indicator for us in terms of this segment returning to positive growth, which we continue to expect to be the case for 2018. One important indicator, large projects were up some 16% in Q3, and this is on top of a 25% increase in Q2. Segment margins, excluding restructuring costs, were 13.8% in the quarter. That's down 40 basis points from last year on a 2% reduction in organic growth. As we look forward, we also expect to see an approximately $8 million profit impact in Q4 from the hurricane impact in this segment. As many of you are aware, the components that we make in our Electrical Products business in Puerto Rico go into our Electrical Systems and Services business, so that becomes a little bit of an issue for us as well in Q4, but that's fully baked into our guidance that we provided. Turning to Hydraulics, the story here is one of continued market strength really across all geographies, both at the OEM and distribution channels. Organic revenues were up 13% in Q3, a further acceleration from the 9% increase in Q2. Margins were improved at 12.6%. And adjusting for restructuring, margins were 14%. We're getting some benefits for sure from higher volume, but most of the improvement is the result of restructuring efforts that have been undertaken in this particular segment. We've also had a strong quarter of bookings again, up 22% from last year, and this follows a 32% increase in Q2. Given the rapid increase in orders in the segment, there are certainly some areas where the industry overall is operating at capacity. This is causing lead times to extend for some new orders. And we're certainly in the process right now of flexing up our employment to respond to the increased orders that we're experiencing. And in our Aerospace business, revenues were essentially flat in the quarter. In the quarter, commercial transport and commercial aftermarket revenues were up low single digit. Military OEM was up low teens. And this was offset by weakness in military aftermarket and also in the business jet segment, both of which were down in the mid-teens. Bookings were up 11% in Q3 after being up 12% in Q2, and we experienced broad-based improvements here in both of the major markets. Other than military transport and military rotorcraft, everything else was positive, with particular strength in military fighters and also in biz-jet. And margins remained strong at 19.2% in the quarter. And lastly in our Vehicle segments, revenues were up 10%, with 9% organic growth on strength in NAFTA heavy-duty vehicles, where production was up 34% in the quarter. Global light vehicle markets were a bit mixed, but South America up mid-20%. Europe and China were up low single digits, with the U.S. down low double digit. Positive FX contributed 2% to growth, and we had 1% negative impact due to the formation of the Eaton Cummins joint venture in the quarter. And we're very pleased with our margin results at 17.4% and adjusting for restructuring costs at 17.7%, so a very strong conversion quarter for our Vehicle business. In addition, we closed the Eaton Cummins joint venture on July 31, and we did receive $600 million in cash for selling 50% interest in the venture. And in addition, during the quarter we announced the launch of our new heavy-duty Endurant transmission to really essentially a very positive reaction from the marketplace. And so we're optimistic about what that's going to bring in the future for that business as well. On page 11, it includes an outline of our expected full-year organic growth for the segments and for Eaton overall. At the Eaton level, given the strong performance in Q3, we're fine-tuning our full-year outlook from 1% to 3% organic growth to 2% to 3% organic growth for the full year, so 0.5 basis point improvement at the midpoint for the full year. In addition, as a result of the stronger NAFTA heavy-duty truck results, we're increasing our 2017 forecast to 250,000 units for the year, taking the overall growth expectation for Vehicle to be up 2% from prior forecasts. The other segments are largely in the range of our prior guidance. Page 12 provides a brief summary of our restructuring program, which remains on track overall for both cost and benefits. For the year, we'll spend $100 million, and we expect to see $155 million of benefits during the year. You'll also note that we spent $22 million on restructuring in Q3, $11 million spent in the segments. And we expect to spend $25 million in Q4, the majority of which will actually be in our segments. Page 13 is a summary of our margin expectations for the full year. And as you can see, the overall margin expectation is unchanged from our prior guidance. The midpoint of our estimate for Electrical Products margins has been reduced by some 30 basis points, largely due to the impact of the natural disasters. Electrical Systems and Services is unchanged. And based upon the midpoint of our margin guidance estimates, the other three segments' expectations have actually moved slightly higher for the year. And turning to page 14, we provide a look at our guidance for Q4 and for the full year. For Q4, we expect to deliver $1.19 to $1.29 operating EPS. We think our organic revenues will be up 3% to 4% versus Q4 2016, really showing continued strength in most of our end markets. Segment margins we believe will be between 16.3% and 16.7%, and this does include the impact of the hurricanes in the quarter. And this represents another, let's say, $0.03 of reduction in operating EPS in Q4. The tax rate we think will be between 10.5% and 11.5%. And so when you roll it all together for the full year, we do expect to deliver $4.55 to $4.65 of operating EPS, excluding the gain from the formation of the Eaton Cummins joint venture. This includes a combined total of $0.06 impact from the natural disasters that we experienced both in Q3 and the impact in Q4. Revenues and margins were really covered on the prior slide, so I won't go back through that. Corporate expenses, interest, pension, and other corporate, we think will now be up $40 million over 2016. The tax rate, including the impact of the gain from the formation of the Eaton Cummins joint venture, we think will be between 13% and 14% for the year. And excluding the $250 million pension contribution that we made in Q3, operating cash flow is now estimated to be between $2.7 billion and $2.9 billion for the year. At the midpoint, this represents a $100 million increase over our prior estimate. And we now believe that our total share repurchases will be $800 million in 2017, $50 million above our prior guidance. And so if we can just maybe turn our attention a little bit to 2018, I'd say while it's too early to provide a detailed outlook, we thought it would be helpful to provide at least a few insights into our early thinking. First, we continue to see improving market conditions and global growth that is setting up well for Eaton's end markets. While we are still developing our plans, we will provide specific guidance certainly on our Q4 call that we'll have at the end of Q4. We currently believe that our combined end markets should grow approximately 3%. As noted, when we announced the Eaton Cummins joint venture, we expect to see lower revenues in both 2017 and 2018 as a result of the joint venture in our Vehicle segment. For 2017, we now expect to see a $25 million revenue impact, and for 2018, we expect to see $175 million revenue impact. As for the profit impact for 2018, we would expect to see a small decremental profit on lower revenues. At this point in the cycle, I would also say that we would typically as a company expect to see roughly 25% incremental profits on organic growth. And once again, while it's early in the planning process, we think for 2018, including the net impact of all restructuring costs and benefits, we think you should plan on an incremental rate that would be closer to 40% as you think about the company for 2018. We expect our tax rate to be between 11% and 13%. And 2018 is the year that we'll complete our $3 billion share repurchase program, so we expect to repurchase another $800 million of our shares during the course of the year. So with that summary, I'll stop here and turn it back over to Don, and we can begin Q&A. Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: Thank you. Our operator is going to provide you some guidance on the Q&A. But before he does, I do want to note a couple things. One, recognizing that many of you have several calls today to address and deal with, we're going to hold the call to an hour today. What I'd like to do to make sure that we can do that and represent all the questions on the air, I guess that you please hold your questions to a question and a follow-up. And with that, I'll turn it over to the operator. Operator : Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: Our first question comes from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hi, good morning. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Good morning, Julian. Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc: Hi. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Good morning, just a quick question. I guess if I look about your 2018 outlook, one of your peers recently talked about next year being a new normal. If we look at Eaton through that lens, would you think that all segment margins, assuming it is more of a normal year, should be within the corridor that you laid out last year, or are there any specific reasons around input costs perhaps why some of the margins may come in at the lower end? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: We appreciate the question, Julian. I would say absolutely, as we laid out during our New York analyst meeting, we set margin expectations for each of our segments, and we would expect all of our businesses to be solidly in that range during the course of 2018. To the specific point around \u2013 I think you inferred how we're thinking about commodity input costs in 2018. We think while once again it's early to make a call on commodity prices, we don't think it represents a headwind to the business going into 2018. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Understood, thank you. And then my follow-up would just be around the ESS business. Back at the Analyst Day in February, you talked about an improvement in growth there, 2018 to 2020, based around oil and gas and broader global CapEx. The oil and gas piece seems to be coming back. I just wondered what your updated thoughts were on the global CapEx driver within the ESS top line. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Our point of view with respect to the outlook for 2018 as it relates to ESS really is unchanged. Certainly, if you think about some of the macro indicators, the Dodge data certainly indicates that large projects are coming back, and we're seeing that in our own business. We do expect that commercial projects growth to continue. Power systems, we think inside of our ESS business, we think it will be a low single-digit growth outlook for 2018. Maybe hurricanes provide a bit of upside at some point, but it's too early to call. And we believe that three-phase PQ markets are in the low to mid-digit growth range. And lastly, to your point, our Crouse-Hinds business certainly is setting up for a much better 2018. So our thesis with respect to 2018 being a better year and a growth year for Electrical Systems and Service we think still holds. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Very helpful. Thank you. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Thanks. Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: Our next question comes from Scott Davis with Melius Research. Scott Davis - Melius Research LLC : Hi. Good morning, guys. Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc: Hi. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Good morning, Scott. Scott Davis - Melius Research LLC : I'm looking to your 3% market growth. I just want to be clear, you say leading to market growth of 3% in 2018. I assume you would imagine you would outgrow the market, so your forecast would be a little bit better than that. Is that how I should look at that? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: That's exactly the way we would think about it. It's early, and we'll certainly provide more detailed guidance when we get to our Q4 earnings call, but at this point, that's meant to be a proxy for what we see in the end markets and we would certainly expect our businesses to grow faster than our end markets. Scott Davis - Melius Research LLC : And if memory serves me right, I don't think you or your peers have really gotten price at all in probably the last four years. Is 2018 setting up as a year where you can go in with particularly some of your electrical products and January 1 price increases, catalog plus realized? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Once again, I think it's early to make a call on the net of price and commodity input costs for 2018. We're still working through our internal planning processes. But I would say that going into 2018, at least on the input cost side, we think the headwinds that we experienced in 2017 are not there in 2018. Once again, early to make a definitive call, and we would expect, like in every year that we go out and we work on getting price in the marketplace. And so I'd say too early to call. It's early in our planning process. But at this point at least, we won't have the big negative that we experienced in 2017. Scott Davis - Melius Research LLC : Fair point. Okay. Thank you. I'll past it on, guys. Thank you. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Thanks. Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Just back on ESS, wondering if you could elaborate a little bit more on what you're seeing in utility. Your business mix isn't exactly like Hubbell's, but this feels like two quarters in a row where you're lagging what they're seeing. You did call out APAC. I wasn't under the impression that was that big of a business. So maybe just give us a little bit of the lay of the land on what you're seeing on particularly the domestic utility side of things. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: We do have a \u2013 with the acquisition of Cooper, we actually did in fact develop a pretty reasonable position in the utility market in Asia as well, and that's really where we saw the weakness during the quarter. Our North America power systems business, we actually saw low single-digit growth, I think pretty much in line with what you're seeing from others in the industry. And so the real weakness for us really was only in the Asia region, and principally China. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : And maybe not to put you on the spot, but everybody on the call here this morning is distracted with this Rockwell-Emerson story. It's kind of interesting from an Eaton standpoint too, right? If you look at your big three electrical competitors, ABB, Schneider, Siemens, they're all big automation houses also. I just wonder how you feel about that strategically. Do you think automation is strategically important to Eaton, and any other comment about how you compete and differentiate in a market that might be consolidating here? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: As you know, we're not really an automation company today, and so it's not a space that we participate in today. And as we've talked about it in prior years, we think our business as a standalone without automation as a piece of it, we think we like our prospects and our opportunities to continue to grow and to be successful. So we'll wait and see what happens with that particular potential announcement, but we don't think it has any material impact on Eaton at all. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Thank you. Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks. Good morning. I think Jeff was asking there if you'd have an interest in Rockwell. It sounds like the answer is no, but I'll leave it there. So just, Craig, you mentioned another $0.03 impact from the hurricanes in 4Q on top of 3Q. Is it fair to assume that most of that would \u2013 or ESS would be more impacted given the component supply chain than EP? And does that $0.03 include any insurance recovery, or is that more of a 2018 impact? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: The way the business works, as I think you understand, Nigel, so today we make components and most of these components are circuit breakers, molded case circuit breakers, these are (28:26) circuit breakers are manufactured in Puerto Rico and they feed our Electrical Systems and Services business, but they also feed our distributors, and they go into the Electrical Products segment as well. And so it does impact both segments in Q4. And the reason we didn't see an impact, at least a material impact, in Electrical Systems and Services in Q3 is because we had inventory in the system. So that's really the way you think about that. It will in fact impact both businesses. And to the specific question around insurance, yes, we do have insurance. There is no insurance recoveries baked into our forecasts. We also have deductibles as well. And so we're still working through the whole insurance process. But at this point, we've not factored in any insurance recoveries into Q4. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, that's clear. And then just thinking about 2018 in a bit more detail but thinking about the pension and the impact of the $250 million discretionary contribution, and if we snapped the line today on returns and rates, how does that look into 2018? Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc: Nigel, it's Rick. You're right to mention that we've added assets, $250 million in Q3, $100 million in Q1, so $350 million. Plus our asset returns as of yesterday were about 15% in the pension plans, and so that's a positive. Where the discount rate ends up is unclear. It might actually \u2013 it's hard to believe, but it's possible it might be slightly less than where we ended 2017. It's bouncing around quite a lot. And so as we look at it, we will clearly have pension expense dropping from 2017 to 2018. The precise amount will depend on where the returns and the discount rates settle out. I would note, however, that our interest expense is likely to go up a little bit. The reason is that we are 40% to 50% floating debt. We issue term debt and then we swap 40% of 50% into floating. And as short rates go up, and certainly most forecasts are that they will continue to go up across next year, that will cause a slight increase in our interest costs. And so that gives you a little bit of color on those two main items. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks, Rick. Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: Our next question comes from Andy Casey with Wells Fargo. Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hi, good morning. Thank you, another question on ESS. Can you help us understand what's going on in the power quality markets? Those continue to be weak. And I'm wondering if you're seeing any sign of improvement there, or if it's potentially a candidate for accelerate or restructuring. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: I'd say to your point, Andy, we have in fact experienced a weaker year than what we anticipated in the power quality markets. And as we said on prior calls, we think this is largely timing as the large customers in this space consolidate activities from prior years as well as look at various architecture changes in the context of the way they configure their data centers. And so we do think it's largely just digesting and a bit of a transitional issue that we're dealing with. As we look forward to 2018, we continue to believe that this market will grow low single digit. Some other industry forecasters are out there with even stronger numbers than that. But we think low single digit makes sense from a planning perspective. And there's nothing that we've seen that would suggest that there's been any fundamental changes in terms of the overall economics in those markets and why those markets should not continue to grow. Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc: And certainly, Andy, the data traffic continues to grow quite rapidly, as is obvious as you look around all of the online sites and video and corporate data. So that's really at the end of the day the key driver which says you need more data processing capability, and it is a little bit lumpy. It changes quarter by quarter a bit just depending on who's placing an order for a large new facility. And so hopefully that gives you some color. Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : It does. Thank you, and one last question. I'm skipping to Hydraulics. Have you witnessed any supply chain constraints popping up in that channel? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: I would say the short answer really would be yes. This V-shaped recovery that we're living through right now in Hydraulics is on the one hand very welcome news and very much overdue, but it certainly caught everybody by surprise, orders up 22% this quarter, 32% last quarter. And so certainly coming into the year, we and our suppliers were not anticipating the kind of V-shaped recovery that we're experiencing right now in Hydraulics. And as a result, lead times, as I mentioned in my opening commentary, have pushed out a bit. We're obviously ramping up our hiring in our manufacturing facilities right now to deal with this increased demand. And so it's a high-quality problem to have, but certainly it caught the industry a little bit flat-footed, and we're all scrambling to recover right now. Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay, thank you very much. Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Joseph Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hi, good morning, guys. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Good morning. Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc: Hi. Joseph Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: So I just wanted to clarify, Craig, your comment on the 40% incremental margins for next year. If I think about the restructuring spending that's occurring and the benefits that you're getting, it seems like you should have at least a $40 million benefit from less spend, and I think roughly about $105 million in incremental benefits from all of the spending that has occurred. I just want to make sure that I have those numbers straight as I think about that 40% number. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: You absolutely do, Joe. And the way we think about it, as I mentioned in my commentary, normally we would expect let's say a 25% incremental at this point in the cycle. For planning purposes, we think you should be planning roughly a 40% incremental, and that's fully inclusive of the lower restructuring spending and the benefits that we've committed to deliver. What we said about restructuring is that typically in our businesses, we have ongoing restructuring every year. And what we've talked about is that we'd only call out restructuring if it's an extraordinary program or an extraordinary event. But what we'd like to do is in the ordinary cost, just absorb the restructuring inside of our businesses and not call it out as a separate reporting item. And so we think as we go into 2018, we're really closing the chapter on the restructuring program that we've announced. Most of those activities become behind us by the time we end this year. And so what's manifested going forward are the benefits. And that's why we think you can plan on roughly a 40% incremental on the change in volume. Joseph Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Yes, that makes sense. And just maybe taking that one step further, assuming hopefully no natural disasters next year that impact operations, you should also get a tailwind from \u2013 about a $0.06 tailwind from that not recurring next year as well, correct? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yes, absolutely, for all the operational issues that we experienced this year, that will certainly be a tailwind for 2018. Joseph Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: And maybe my one follow-up there is can you guys tell us what the revenue impact was from the natural disasters, and then specifically on EPG growth because the growth there was really solid? It's probably the best levels I think that we've seen since the early part of 2015. And so maybe a little bit more color on what's driving the strength in that business as well would be really helpful. Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc: Joe, let me give you the revenue impact. Our overall revenue reduction in Q3 we estimate at $12 million, of which $10 million was in products, and that's understandable. The facilities were shut down for 7 to 10 days before they started up. And while we did have product in our warehouses, there began to be some shortages as we went through the quarter. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Let me. To your point, we've covered a little bit of this in the opening commentary. But really as I've said, in general we really did see notable strength in the Americas. Industrial controls, as I mentioned, were strong. Commercial residential products were strong. Europe has really been a standout performer this year really across of many of our businesses. Europe was really strong across almost all geographies. And so I'd say it was really pretty broad-based revenue strength that we experienced in most of Electrical Products. Joseph Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. Okay, great. Thanks, guys. Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: The next question comes from Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc. Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets : Hey, good morning. Craig, you mentioned Crouse-Hinds lifting its head up. Can you just talk a little bit more about what you're seeing there and what the customers are telling you about the outlook into 2018? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: As I mentioned, we saw revenue turn positive in Q3, the first time in quite some time, and orders as well. And so very much I'd say consistent with what we expect, given stabilization in oil prices and really what we think is probably a lot of pent-up demand. That business is starting to, as we expect it to, inflect positively. And at this point in terms of customer input, it's very much consistent with our view of the world that we think 2018 should be a better year. How much better, at this point it's premature to say. We're still in the planning processes, but certainly it will be a growth year for Crouse-Hinds in 2018. Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets : Craig, could you give some color on how you think power systems shapes up into 2018? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: We think power systems continues to be low single-digit growth. It's certainly baked into that assumption. There's not any major infrastructure spending bill. If we end up getting a major infrastructure spending bill in the U.S., that business could be a bit stronger. But at this point, we're not counting on it. And so we think there's the normal replacement CapEx cycle, and that business continues to deliver low single-digit growth. Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets : Thanks a lot. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: You bet. Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: Our next question comes from Steven Winoker with UBS. Steven Eric Winoker - UBS: Thanks. Good morning, guys. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Hi. Steven Eric Winoker - UBS: Hi. So just on that 2018 initial thoughts, a little clarification. Are you thinking about holding corporate expense flat for next year excluding all the insurance impact and things like that? Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc: I would say we're still in the process of planning, but our general construct is definitely an ambition to hold it roughly flat. Steven Eric Winoker - UBS: Okay. So if that's true and I ignore the natural disaster recoveries that might come or the year-on-year impact, then based on what you ran through, and it rose a little bit faster than that 3% market growth that you put in and the 40% incremental, it seems like you'd be talking about north of 10% EPS growth if that were to all come together on that page. Is my math somewhere close? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: That's close. And in fact, what we talked about is that we said 8% to 9% EPS growth through this planning cycle. And the implications of that is that between 2018 and 2020, it's 11% to 13%. And so you can certainly assume that we're very much on track to deliver that commitment in terms of EPS growth. Steven Eric Winoker - UBS: Okay, great, Craig. That's helpful. And then on the cash flow dynamic, which seemed to also be proving out well, any thoughts or a little color on what's driving the improvement there? Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc: I would just say that we have managed our working capital quite effectively so far this year, and of course, our profits are growing as well. So it's really those two key factors. We're quite pleased with the cash flow and our ability to generate more than we had even anticipated at the start of the year, and so it leaves us in a very good cash position. We had net debt to total capital of right around 30% at the end of Q3, and it should go lower than that in Q4. And that's why we elected to put a little bit more into the pension plan, just to bring us up to levels that are pretty well funded. Steven Eric Winoker - UBS: And maybe just to follow that up, Craig, given the cash dynamic of the organization and you're already talking up some of the capital deployment, but now that you're completing both the share repurchase program, the restructuring is behind you, any initial thoughts on moving to the front foot on some of the things that were too early to talk about a couple years ago on the M&A side, getting more maybe aggressive of that front, or do you still think that's not really the right direction for the corporation? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: What we said with respect to M&A is that, as we think about the priorities in terms of the call on capital, we've said number one, it's to reinvest in our businesses to drive organic growth because that's the first priority with respect to capital. We said we'll continue to pay a strong dividend, which we're committed to. And we also said that we would complete the share repurchase plan. And we have another year to go, $800 million of share repurchase in 2018. But then having said that, we said there's still plenty of cash left over to continue to add strategic assets to the portfolio. And so we continue to be very much interested in looking at opportunities to acquire strategic capabilities and with a priority in our Electrical and in our Aerospace business. That hasn't changed. And we're certainly in a much better cash position today to do so. Having said that, we obviously have nothing to announce. But we will commit and promise that we won't let cash build up on the balance sheet. In the event that we're not able to readily deploy cash into value-creating M&A, we'll find opportunities to put the cash to work in the form of perhaps more share buybacks. We have a debt maturity coming up next year. So we have some other options around effectively redeploying the cash in the event that the M&A opportunities don't materialize. Steven Eric Winoker - UBS: Okay, great. Thank you. Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: Our next question comes from Rob McCarthy with Stifel. Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Good morning, everyone. Congratulations on a good quarter. Two questions, and I have a little bit of ADD as do others, so I do apologize if some of this has been covered. But embedded in your expectation for next year, how should we think about the state of play for U.S. non-residential construction? What are you seeing now or what's your prospects for growth? How are you just ring-fencing what you're seeing for 2018 and how that could play out? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yes, it's a good question. It's obviously an important one for us as well and one that we're spending a lot of time internally thinking through. Perhaps, Rob, it would helpful at this juncture to just quote some of the external data that's out there. And I'd say that by and large, if we take a look at most of the consensus numbers and the consensus forecasts for non-res construction next year, you'd say it's centering around 3% to 4%, perhaps with a little bit of strength on the commercial construction side, a little less strength in industrial construction overall, but it's really centering around 3% to 4%. And we think that number is very much in line with what we're experiencing and expect for the year. Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And just as a follow-up, if we think about the prospect, to Scott's question around market growth leading to maybe more mid-single-digit growth for you because you expect to outperform your markets, thinking about the leverage, I think you talk about incremental margins through the cycle 30%-ish range. But could we stack-rank where you'd expect to see maybe higher incrementals in 2018, if the growth materializes, how you would think about your portfolio in that regard, because clearly, you would think as you have a first spurt of material growth here after a while of weak volumes and deflation, you should see higher incrementals at least that year versus through the cycle. So any commentary around that would be helpful. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Rob, what we've said is that for the company we said yes, we'll absolutely see higher incrementals for Eaton overall. And that's why we said instead of what we would think would be normal at 25% at this point in the cycle, we said you can plan on 40%. What the specific incrementals are by business, at this point, we're really not in a position to comment on. We've not been through our internal planning processes yet. And we'll certainly be in a position to provide some margin guidance for 2018 as we discuss the outlook in our Q4 earnings call. Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thank you for taking my questions. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Sure. Thank you. Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: Next question comes from Chris Glynn with Oppenheimer. Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Thanks. Just looking at Aerospace, the orders are starting to compound there nicely, double digits I think on double-digits orders in the prior year. Is that business starting to shape up to get into a higher growth profile as you look into 2018? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yes, we certainly hope so. This has been a little bit of a flat year for our Aerospace business this year and we are very much pleased by the double-digit orders this quarter and last quarter, and it's certainly shaping up for 2018 to be a better year. Commercial transport continues to be strong. Commercial aftermarket continues to be quite strong. We think as we look at 2018, the one \u2013 a couple points of weakness that we experienced this year was in military aftermarket and in the biz-jet markets. And our order intake in both of those segments also inflected quite positively in Q3. And so we think once again, Aerospace is certainly setting up to have a better year in 2018. We're not in a position at this point to quantify and forecast a more precise number, but we certainly think it returns to positive growth. Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then as you wait for the appropriate time to give an outlook for the segments and ESS in particular, could you remind us what the peak-to-trough revenue journey was for Crouse-Hinds in particular? Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yes, it was down about between 25% and 35% from the peak to the trough, and now it's starting to climb out. Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Okay. And if memory serves, it started at around $1.3 billion maybe? Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc: It was a little bit higher than that. It was about $1.5 billion. Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Okay, great. Thank you. Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with Wolfe Research. Josh Pokrzywinski - Wolfe Research LLC : Hi, good morning, guys. Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc: Hi. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Good morning. Josh Pokrzywinski - Wolfe Research LLC : Just on the organic growth investment that you talked about, Craig, where are you guys specifically making some inroads and where can we see externally some of that progress? Because I would imagine that outside of maybe Electrical Products and Hydraulics, you guys haven't maybe been as enthused with the growth. So what underpinning that should we really be focused on going forward as maybe seeing that investment starting to pay off? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Josh, it's a big question for the time that we have. And most certainly, as we think about our analyst meeting in 2018, we'll once again take you through our key growth vectors that we're investing in, in our businesses, as we did this year. And if you recall, if you had an opportunity to attend our meeting this year, we spent a lot of time talking about investments that we're making in IoT and took you through our strategy there and what we're doing across the company but principally in our electrical businesses, whether it was smart home or smart grid, smart factory and the investments that we're making around embedding intelligence in all the components that we manufacture. But in every one of the businesses, I'd say it's a big question and perhaps one that I can't do justice to in the amount of time that we have on this call. But certainly you can look to us to really shed a lot of light on that at our analyst meeting that we're going to have in February of next year. Josh Pokrzywinski - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. And then just maybe just shifting over to the incrementals, I know people have asked this a few different ways now. But I guess if you pull out the restructuring savings and the reduction in spend, you're looking at a sub-20% incremental margin here for next year as a high-level starting point. Presumably, mix starts to go your way, particularly with what's going on in Crouse-Hinds. Is there some other big plug that we should be aware of that changes as we get into out years? I'm not asking for 2019 guidance, of course. But I guess what I'm trying to understand is as restructuring becomes a smaller piece of the bridge, is there something that steps up to replace that field? Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc: Josh, I'm not sure what numbers you're looking at. As we said, we see the incrementals overall being about 40%. And if you were to then adjust for the restructuring, it would be about 25%. And so you must be making some other assumptions, but that's our current view right now at this early point in our planning. Josh Pokrzywinski - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. Maybe I'll just follow up offline then. Thanks. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Okay, thank you. Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: Our next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Good morning, Deane. Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc: Hi. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hey, Craig, I was hoping you could expand on this high-quality problem of this V-shaped recovery in Hydraulics and maybe touch on where are the end markets and applications. How much is mobile versus stationary, and how sustainable is this uptick? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: The first thing I'd say, Deane, it's been fairly broad-based. It's really been all regions of the world, and it really has covered both mobile and stationary markets, with more strength in mobile than in stationary, but both markets performing quite favorably. And a lot of the growth, as you probably are aware, is coming out of China. If you take a look at some of the key end markets in China, markets like the excavator market or the wheel loader market, those markets in some cases have been up more than 100%. And so it's been a very broad-based recovery, a lot of it tied to construction equipment, to material handling. We also participate in the commercial vehicle market inside of our Hydraulics business as well. That market has been strong. And the one market today that's an important market for us that has started to build positively is also be Ag market. And we think that market perhaps returns to some more positive growth in 2018. And so we think that this point in the cycle that Hydraulics is setting up to be a multiyear growth story. And quite frankly, that's what's needed, given the fact that we've lived through the downturn over the last couple years. It's been since 2014 that that business has grown. So we think it's certainly setting up to be a positive growth story for at least a couple years to come. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thanks. And then my follow-up is can you clarify the 2018 assumption if I heard it correctly that you're not expecting any material cost headwinds? How \u2013 if you could, frame for us where that stands today if you snap the line on copper, on steel. Are you doing any additional hedging or just advance purchasing? Anything would be helpful there. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: I'd say that every commodity's got its own story. And we have in fact continued to see a bit of commodity price increases as we came through Q3, but it's very much in line what our forecasts have been. And so I don't want to suggest that we've not experienced commodity price inflation. We certainly have, but it's been very much in line with what we anticipated and expected in the business. In terms of hedging, we do some hedging in terms of our businesses. What we think about going into 2018, there is a change in some of the accounting rules that allow you to perhaps take down some additional hedges. We've not yet thought through exactly how we're going to approach that. We're still in the early planning stages. But there is certainly another opportunity as we think about 2018 to put some additional functional hedges in place that we've not been able to do historically. Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc: That's right. You're able with these new accounting rules to hedge components instead of the raw metals, and that allows you to put on truly economic hedges as opposed to just accounting hedges. But broadly, Deane, our view is that if you look at the mix of metals, we think that they are not likely across 2018 to show significant increase. So there will be pockets, but on average, we don't see a significant rise likely. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you. Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: Our next question comes from Ann Duignan with JPMorgan. Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Good morning. Most of my questions have been answered by now, obviously. But maybe in Hydraulics, you could talk a little bit about whether you are the bottleneck that's driving the lengthy lead times, or is it your supply chain? Just where exactly are the bottlenecks building? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: What I'd say, Ann, most of the bottlenecks, as you know this business fairly well, it always ends of being the long lead time components, castings and forgings and others, back throughout the supply chain where, in many cases, can be lead times are three months to six months. And so we're ramping up our hiring from a labor perspective. And at this point, labor tends to be much easier to put in place. But the big issues continue to be in the long lead time components, and I'd say especially in castings. Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And there's no simple way around that, I'm going to assume. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: No simple way around it. Obviously, we're working on some potential longer-term solutions and new technologies like additive and other things that we think hold a lot of promise to shorten those lead times. But at this point, it is a challenge that we're dealing with. And lead times have in fact pushed out in some case. But I'd say on balance, it's a pretty high-quality problem to have, and we'll work through it in relatively short order. Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC : It is a high-quality problem to have after so many years. My second question is maybe one that's better for the Analyst Day, but I'll ask it anyway. I've been getting a lot of questions on the notion that Boeing is trying to grow its aftermarket business and obviously capture some of those nice aftermarket margins in Aerospace. How is the supply chain reacting to that and how do you expect it to change your business over the midterm? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: We're certainly very much aware of the various initiatives that our different OEMs have to more fully participate in the aftermarket, and so we're working with them. We think today, there are in fact opportunities in places where Boeing and other customers can add value in that supply chain. And so our goal is obviously to work with Boeing and others towards a mutually beneficial outcome for both companies, and we're optimistic that we're going to be able to do that. Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC : So net-net a positive, perhaps more volume, more original parts versus a negative, is that the way to interpret that? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: We think in every problem, there's probably a win-win outcome there someplace, where there are things that we want and places they can help us and things that we can contribute to help them against their particular goals. And so we're confident that we're going to find a solution that works for both companies. Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay, I'll leave it there. Thanks, I appreciate it. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Thanks, Ann. Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: We have time for one last question, and that will come from Andrew Obin with BofA Merrill Lynch. Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi, good morning, guys. Thanks for fitting me in. Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc: Hi. Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Just a question on the inventory level in the distribution both on the Electrical side and the Hydraulics side. The past couple of years, we never got this restocking trend going on. Are you seeing anything that would indicate that at last with macro picking up, dealers are considering restocking inventory in the channel? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yes, what I'd say probably largely in the Electrical business, we really have not seen a big change in inventory levels. Those markets are certainly improving, but not the kind of movements that we think at this point would result in any big changes in inventory levels. Certainly, what we've seen in hydraulics, we certainly have seen some replenishment of inventory in the hydraulics markets, although I will tell you that our sales into the OEM segment continued to outpace our sales into the distribution segment, and so hopefully that's a positive sign of things to come. But there certainly has been a little bit of inventory replenishment that's really taken place throughout the supply chain in the Hydraulics business, which is why you see that our order input is obviously up much higher than our sales output and much higher than many of our OEMs output as well. Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got you, and just a follow-up question on Aerospace. I know we talked about it. But is there a specific program? I'm just a little bit surprised that given your exposure that revenues were flat. I would have thought that was like 777 exposure, but you did not call it out. I'm just trying to figure out if there's a specific military program that's holding you back this quarter because I think by and large, defense companies that had flat revenues, there was a specific program in charge, and commercial guys generally posted positive growth. Just if you could, give a little bit more detail. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: As I mentioned in my commentary, first I would tell you that we're about 60 :40. 60% of our business is commercial and 40% is military. And where we saw weakness is we saw weakness in first and foremost commercial. The commercial side in biz-jet and the biz-jet sector continues to be weak. And we have relatively large content on a number of important biz-jet platforms. And then on the military side, it was the military aftermarket. And that we would say is largely a function of a number of large campaigns, mods and retrofit upgrades that we had in prior years that have not repeated. And so we think once again, transitional issues that we're seeing in the Aerospace business, orders are up nicely. And so we think that really bodes well for 2018 and beyond.

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to the Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Don Bullock. Please go ahead. Don Bullock : Good morning. I am Don Bullock, Eaton\u2019s Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you for joining us for Eaton\u2019s fourth quarter 2017 earnings call. With me today are Craig Arnold, our Chairman and CEO and Rick Fearon, our Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer. As is typical, our agenda today will include opening remarks by Craig highlighting the performance in the fourth quarter and our outlook for 2018. As we have done in our past calls, we will be taking questions at the end of Craig\u2019s comments. The press release from our earning announcement this morning and the presentation will be posted on our website or have been posted on our website at www.eaton.com. Please note that both the press release and the presentation do include reconciliations to non-GAAP measures. A webcast of the call was also accessible on our website and will be available for replay. Before we dive into the details, I would like to remind you that our comments today will include statements related to expected future results of the company and are therefore by definition forward-looking statements. The actual results may differ from those forecasted projections due to a wide range of risk and uncertainties that were all described in our earnings release and the presentation also outlined in our 8-K. Before I turn it over to Craig, I do want to highlight a change that you may have noticed in our press release and presentation today. Since about 2001, we have used the term operating earnings and operating earnings per share in description of our financial results. Those terms have consistently been used to describe net income and net income per share less acquisition integration and transaction costs. The reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures of net income and net income per share have also historically been provided on our website. Going forward, the term operating earnings and operating earnings per share will be replaced with adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per share. The definition of those measures, remain the same for Q4 that is the net income and net income per share minus any acquisition integration and transaction charges. We will continue to provide you with reconciliations to the GAAP measures of net income and net income per share on our website. With that, let me turn it over to Craig to go through the results. Craig Arnold : Okay. Hey, thanks Don. I will begin on Page 3 where we highlight our Q4 results. And overall I\u2019d say we are very pleased with our fourth quarter results. And just as important, the momentum that we are carrying into 2018, we generated net income and adjusted earnings per share of $1.43 and this includes as we noted $62 million of income from the Tax Cut and Jobs Act. You will recall that we issued guidance in late December and we estimated that the impact of tax reform would lead to a one-time charge of between $90 million and $110 million. As we completed Q4 and worked with the details of the tax reform bill, this turned into a $62 million benefit. The adjustment of our deferred tax assets and liabilities to the lower tax rate created $79 million of income, which was partially offset by a $70 million charge for the mandatory repatriation tax. Excluding these one-time items, our net income and adjusted earnings per share were $1.29, $0.05 above the midpoint of our guidance and up 15% over last year, so really results that we are pleased with. Sales were also strong in the quarter, up 7%, of which 7% was organic. And as noted, orders were also strong across all of our segments. Segment operating margins increased to a record 6.5% and excluding restructuring costs, we posted operating margins of 17.1%, which was up 80 basis points from prior year. And given the strong orders, we decided to actually accelerate some of our restructuring initiatives, which resulted in a spending $41 million in the quarter and this was some $16 million above our prior guidance. We also continue to generate robust cash, operating cash flow in the quarter, which was $879 million. Our free cash flow to net income was 112% and excluding the $62 million of one-time income from the tax bill it was 124%, so once again very strong performance. In last we repurchased $61 million of our shares during the quarter which brought our full year share repurchase to $850 million. Turning to Page 4, we summarized the key income statement items and I want to just highlight a few key metrics here. We have covered some of this data already. So first I will highlight our segment operating margins were up 21% and excluding restructuring costs margins were 17.1%, up 80 basis points year-on-year on the 5% organic growth. And this reflects naturally the benefit that we are seeing from the restructuring program as well as incremental profits on our revenue growth. I would also note that our $41 million of restructuring expense in the quarter was $36 million in the business segments and $5 million at corporate. Turning our attention to the segments, I will begin with Electrical Products. Our Electrical Products business grew 6% in Q4, 3% of the growth was organic and 3% from positive currency and our orders increased 5% with strength in both the Americas and the Europe region what we call EMEA. In the Americas specifically, we experienced particularly strong growth in industrial and large commercial markets as well as in residential products and in the Canadian market. And in Europe we saw strength in our power quality business, industrial markets as well as in large commercial projects. And so by and large we are pleased with the order growth that we saw in the Products segment in the fourth quarter. On Page 6, we summarized results from the Electrical Systems and Services segment where we really have a very positive story unfolding. First the business has returned to growth both in revenue and the orders in the quarter. Sales were up 3%, 2% organic growth, 2% from positive currency which was partially offset by 1% from the divestiture of a joint venture that we had. I would add here that the organic revenue turned positive slightly ahead of our expectations on strength largely in harsh and hazardous, the Canadian market and in power distribution assemblies business which was primarily in the Americas. Perhaps more significantly orders in Q4 were up 12% over prior year and once again with strong growth in the Americas. As we have seen for the last several quarters we saw particularly strength in large power distribution assemblies, parts and hazardous systems in our electrical services business which also posted strong growth in the quarter. Operating margins also improved nicely. Excluding restructuring costs, margins increased 140 basis points to 15.6%. And this improvement was primarily the result of incremental margins on the revenue growth, but also the benefits from the restructuring actions that we have been taking. You will also notice that we referenced a small divestiture here was taken a joint venture during the quarter. And I would say the way to think about this is it really represents the work that\u2019s ongoing across the company to continue to review our portfolio for strategic fit and also for performance. Turning the page, we are also very pleased with the improvements that we are seeing in our hydraulics business. We continue to generate strong growth, 18% in the quarter, 17% of which was organic and 1% from currency. And the improvement I can only say that\u2019s very broad base with both distribution and OEM sales up both in the mid-teens and we continue to experience really strong order growth increasing 25% in the quarter with solid growth in all regions. And the growth in the quarter really matches our growth for the year both coming in at up 25%. Operating margins also continued to expand reaching 13% and this number excludes restructuring costs and represents a 150 basis point improvement over last year. And I\u2019d say we were pleased that after several years of significant restructuring and hard work by hydraulics team that margins excluding restructuring costs are now operating within the margin target range that we set for the business, up 13% to 16%. We certainly have work to do in this segment but we fully expect to continue to see margin improvements and to be solidly within the target margin range that we set for the business as we move forward. As I noted last quarter, the business also continues to experience a significant ramp up in orders. As you can see we are addressing these issues and making progress. On Page 8, we cover aerospace. Our sales increased 4%, 2% coming from organic and 2% from positive currency and we also had another quarter of strong bookings, up a solid 9% with strength across almost all end markets and I would specifically note aftermarket bookings were up 9% and we saw very strong order growth in military OEM markets. Operating margins continue to represent strong performance and excluding restructuring costs increased 20 basis points to as you can see 20.2%. Moving to our vehicle business, you will note that we once again had a very strong quarter with sales growth of 13%, 12% coming from organic growth, 3% from positive currency, and 2% reduction as a result of us forming the Eaton Cummins joint venture. The strong order growth was driven primarily by strength in NAFTA classic truck markets, which were up 37% and this was somewhat muted by global light vehicle markets, which were flat during the quarter. Operating margins, excluding restructuring costs, were up a solid 250 basis points from prior year and reached 17.3%. Unlike other businesses this segment is really benefiting by delivering the incremental margins on the change in volume, but also benefiting from the restructuring initiatives that have been undertaken in this segment. Before we turn to page completely on 2007, I thought it would be helpful to briefly summarize some of the notable highlights at what we think was a great year of progress and our thoughts are summarized here on Page 10. First, our markets returned to growth with modest acceleration as we saw in the second half of the year. This resulted in 3% organic growth for the year. It would also appear that we are in a period of we call it synchronous global growth and we really have all seen the enthusiasm associated with the U.S. tax bill. So, we think these two factors are really setting the global economy and Eaton up for modest acceleration as we entered 2018. Our net income and adjusted earnings per share was $6.68 and this includes naturally the gain from the formation of the joint venture with Cummins as well as the income on the tax changes. Excluding these one-time items, our adjusted EPS was $4.65 and this was $0.20 above the midpoint of our original guidance and up 10% over 2016. As we continue to generate strong operating cash flow of $2.7 billion, 2017 was a record year for the company and this by the way is after making a $350 million voluntary contribution to our U.S. qualified pension plan, so very strong cash flow during the year. I would also add that our U.S. qualified pension plan was funded at 95% at the end of the year and as of last Friday actually was funded at 98% and so despite really having the lowest discount rates that we have seen in several decades, our pension plans are really close to fully funded. So, we really feel good about getting that issue behind us. Lastly, we completed our third year of our full year share repurchase program repurchasing $850 million of our shares during the year and this was 11.5 million shares or 2.5% of our shares outstanding as of the beginning of the year. And between dividend and share repurchase, we actually returned $1.9 billion to shareholders in 2017. So, overall, I would say I am very proud of the entire Eaton team in the year that we had. We delivered on our commitments to shareholders and we continue to advance the mission that we saw for the company. Turning our attention to 2018, Page 11 is the summary of growth and margins assumptions for Eaton overall and for each of our segments. We expect organic revenue growth in the electrical products business to grow approximately 3% and our forecast of 3% organic growth in Electrical Products is about the same as we experienced in 2017 with really broad growth in all geographies. In electrical systems and services, that business is really in the early stages of a rebound and we expect to see 4% growth in the year. Our forecast reflects growth in the America is driven by power distribution assemblies, harsh and hazardous systems and moderate growth in the rest of the world. For hydraulics, we really anticipate another very strong year of double digit organic growth of approximately 10%. The 10% organic growth compared to 12% in \u201817 and is certainly supported by the order book in the backlog that we carry into 2018. And the growth I would say here really continue to be driven primarily by the strength that we are seeing in construction markets around the world. Our aerospace business is expected to grow approximately 3% and we expect to see strong growth in commercial OEM markets as well as in commercial aftermarket. We also expect military OEM markets to grow modestly and this is compared to a slight decline that we experienced in 2017. And finally, vehicle business is expected to see 1% organic growth and the strongest market is once again expected to be not the Class 8, which is expected to grow some 9%. And it\u2019s important I think to note here that much of this growth will be reflected in the Eaton Cummins joint venture where we don\u2019t consolidate revenue. And so some of you may have been a little bit surprised by the relatively muted growth number for vehicles and that\u2019s largely because much of this growth is being captured in side of the joint venture. And in the global light vehicle market should grow 1% to 2%. Yes, with these rates of organic growth and in the benefits of the multi-year restructuring program we expect to see certain margins in the ranges that you see noted on the page. For Eaton overall, our segment margin guidance is in the range of 16.3% to 16.9%. And this includes the net impact of any restructuring actions. And so all of our restructuring expenditures are embedded in this number, so at a midpoint of 16.6% this represents an 80 basis point improvement over 2017. And looking at our segments, vehicle year-to-year margins are expected to be flat with other segments improving between the low of 30 basis points in aerospace to a high of 280 basis points in hydraulics. So we think 2018 will be another year of solid progress and the year in which we took another step forward towards delivering the 17% to 18% segment margins that we have committed as a part of our 5-year financial goals. And page 12 our final slide, we summarized our full year guidance for 2018. Our guidance for net income and adjusted earnings per share is in the range of $5 to $5.20 a share at the midpoint of $5.10 which represents a 10% increase over 2017 and this obviously excludes any of the one-time items that benefited 2017. On revenues, we have already gone through the details behind the 4% organic growth outlook. But I would note here that we also expect to see $150 million of positive impact from currency, but this will be largely offset by $150 million negative associated with the impact of the joint ventures. And this includes both the formation of the Eaton Cummins joint venture in vehicle and as well as the dissolution of the joint venture that we referenced in electrical systems and services. And as noted we expect segment margins to be in a range of 16.3 to 16.9. And we think corporate expenses will be flat during the year. We are also updating our prior December \u201817 commentary on the impact of U.S. tax reform in 2018. After further review we expect our tax rate to be between 13% and 15% instead of the 14% to 16% previously announced. And importantly here, very important here I think we expect our tax rate for 2019 onwards to stabilize in the 14% to 16% range. So we think it \u2013 as we think about tax reform, we are pleased that that particular uncertainty has not been taken off the table as we move forward. We also expect another year of record operating cash flow between $2.9 billion and $3.1 billion. We expect to spend $575 million in capital expenditures with resulting free cash flow of $2.3 billion to $2.5 billion. And you recall that 2018 is also the year that we complete the final leg of our full year $3 billion share repurchase program and as a result we are planning to repurchase $800 million of our shares during the year. So in summary I would say we are very pleased with our Q4 and 2017 results. We expect 2018 to be another strong year and to continue to deliver on our commitments to shareholders that we outlined as a part of our 2016 to 2020 goals. So at this point, I will stop and I will open it up for questions. Don Bullock : Our operator will provide you with the questions \u2013 with the instructions for the question-and-answer. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Don Bullock : Our first question comes from David Raso with Evercore. David Raso : Hi, good morning. Don Bullock : Hi. David Raso : The obvious star of this report here is the ESS orders, can you flush that out for us a little bit more this top in orders and like the core guidance is pretty healthy at 4% for that division, looking you will you help us a little bit with the cadence of this kind of order strength as you see it\u2019s starting the year further into \u201818 and maybe some timings is there some lag on those orders translating into revenue growth? Craig Arnold : Yes. I would we are very pleased with the strength that we are seeing in electrical system and services orders. And as I noted in my opening commentary we think this recovery is coming roughly maybe a quarter even earlier than what we originally anticipated. But I would say we are really \u2013 we continue to see with oil prices rising and we continue to see a return to growth in our harsh and hazardous, our Crouse-Hinds business. That business is picking up nicely. And in the one \u2013 the large piece of that business that we had really been under a lot of pressure over the last a couple of years or so our large projects. And so our large systems business, really not just this quarter, but last quarter as well have started to improve markedly and so we are seeing that come through obviously in stronger orders in Q4. As you think about the timing of orders these are obviously big projects. They tend to have longer lead time until \u2013 as we think about 2018, we think the business starts a little slower in the first half of the year and picks up in the second half of the year and that\u2019s just a function of the timing of a lot of these large projects. David Raso : And just two clarifications if you don\u2019t mind, the impact on the LIFO, FIFO change on the inventory for the 2018 EPS and also if I missed that I apologize, the restructuring charge the total for \u201817 and what we expected to be in \u201818 the restructuring costs going through? Rick Fearon : Yes. I will address the first one Dave, it\u2019s Rick. The impact on LIFO in the fourth quarter was $0.01 out of the 129, so it was not at all significant. And typically and as we look back at past years LIFO has ranged between positive $10 million, minus $10 million, so really $0.01 to $0.02 timing impact. And just to comment, because I did see in analyst report somebody asked why did you make this change, well, the great majority of our peers are only on FIFO. And in fact in most of the rest of the world you have to be on FIFO. The reason that our U.S. operations have been on LIFO is that up until a couple of years ago for income tax purposes we run LIFO. And the rule was if you run LIFO for income tax, you had to be on LIFO for book purposes. But as we looked at all of our peers being mainly or most of our peers being on FIFO and we looked at the extra time and trouble it took to make these complex calculations to go on the LIFO it seem to us that the better move was simply to move everything to FIFO would have $0.01 to $0.02 impact in any given year. And we will in our K we will show you the impact over the last 5 years, but it is $0.01 to $0.02 positive, negative in any given year. The last comment I will make just so people don\u2019t misunderstand our segment results that we have been reporting all of these years have always been on FIFO. So the only impact on LIFO is in corporate. We take a LIFO charge or LIFO income and it shows up in our corporate numbers. David Raso : That\u2019s really helpful. And the restructuring costs\u2026 Rick Fearon : Yes. It\u2019s a different restructuring, we have spent a $116 million in restructuring in 2017 and embedded in our guidance for 2018 we are going to spend $90 million. And so that\u2019s a little bit up from I know some of the prior guidance. And I think you were to see that as a really positive thing. The reality is we simply see lots of opportunities to continue to improve the company and we continue to make those investments that have very attractive returns and I will remind you once again that all of restructuring cost is fully embedded in the guidance that we provide. Now as we mentioned before, we were on this multiyear restructuring program, where we were every quarter talking about restructuring and calling it out. What we would intend to do going forward is that simply be embedded on our business, it will be embedded in our results and so we would not intend to talk about restructuring as we think about the reporting our results during the course of 2018. David Raso : Craig, that\u2019s way more impressive, because I don\u2019t think the restructuring would be that high in \u201818 so you are still sticking to your 40% incremental, but you are taking a bigger hit on the restructuring like in a way the year-over-year help from lower restructuring is not as helpful as I thought. Did you bump up the savings or the saving still supposed to be around 50%? Craig Arnold : Yes. I mean, if you think about some of the newer items that we are taking on many of those benefits will be in the out years and so we would not necessarily expect to see a very big increase in restructuring savings in the year on the increment, but I think it\u2019s simply a reflection of the fact that the underlying growth rates will be a little stronger than what we anticipated and we took this opportunity to continue to reinvest in the business and to reinvest in programs that were going to have future benefits. David Raso : So your implied 39.2% incrementals here are a little \u201ccleaner\u201d right, they are not necessarily so much a year-over-year reduction in restructuring? Craig Arnold : Absolutely. That\u2019s the way to think about it. David Raso : Alright. No, I appreciate that. Thanks for the color. Don Bullock : Our next question comes from Scott Davis with Melius Research. Scott Davis : Hey, good morning guys. Craig Arnold : Hi. Scott Davis : I was trying to reconcile a little bit that the comments about global synchronous recovery in the guide on Electrical Products side, I mean, particularly given bookings up 5%. I know the quarter, which is up 3%, but your comps are relatively easy. I mean, what gives you \u2013 I mean other than just being conservative, I mean, is there anything else there that leads to some cautiousness as far as that ramp \u2013 that 2018 ramp versus 2017? Craig Arnold : Yes, I would say, your reference to the comps being easy, I\u2019d say our Electrical Products business during the course of 2017 had a solid year of growth and so it grew 3% in 2017. And I think post the growth in each of the quarters and so I don\u2019t know that the comps are necessarily easy, but maybe a little color on those markets that we think will perhaps grow a little faster and those that will grow a little slower as we think about the end markets, we think going into 2018 our industrial markets and large commercial business inside of Electrical Products will be above the average of that 3%. We think the components that we sell even in this segment into the oil and gas markets and applications will be above that number. We think that products going into smaller commercial applications could be a little below that number as well as single phase power quality and the other piece we report our lighting segment inside of Electrical Products and that business is very much like you have seen from some of the others in the industry, we think the lighting business in 2018 is more like flat to down slightly than it is growth. And so that\u2019s also probably having a muting effect at least on the overall growth of our Electrical Products segment. Scott Davis : That\u2019s really helpful. And then as a follow-up, Craig, there is always a lot of chatter around your portfolio and lots of company\u2019s peers of yours going through different stages of de-conglomeration and such. I mean, is this the portfolio that you plan writing or can we expect further changes in 2018? Craig Arnold : Yes. The way I would answer that question is guys, every one of our business today are measured against our criteria and we have laid that out in New York last year and the year before and we will talk about it again this year. And so one of the big changes as I think about the portfolio in the company is that we used to talk about the fact that we had a portfolio and the way this portfolio of businesses work together would enable us to create a company that was good for the cycle. Well, the big pivot that we made was that we said today, every business had to be a good business in its own right. And we have laid out a criteria that says here is the criteria, you have to be global business, you have to grow faster than GDP, you have to deliver mid to high returns. And with sales, you have to deliver mid 20s return on assets and if you are in a cyclical market you have to deliver a minimum of 13%. And so we laid out the criteria for each of our businesses. And I can tell you that each of our businesses today is making great progress towards those objectives the extent that they are not necessarily meeting them today. So we like the portfolio today, but having said that, we will always look at it. Throughout our history we have always continued to be tough minded about businesses and things that made sense and things that don\u2019t. So we will always continue to look at the portfolio and to make changes where we think it makes sense from a shareholder value creation. The way we think about portfolio management is more around the margins of what we do in our businesses and that\u2019s where we talked about a number of small divestitures things that we are stepping out of, things that we are going to manage the portfolio inside of the businesses that we do have, you can rest assure we will keep looking at it. Scott Davis : That\u2019s good color, okay. Thanks guys. Good luck to you. I will pass it on. Don Bullock : Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Joe Ritchie : Hi, good morning guys. Maybe just starting on ESS margins for a second in the guidance of 20 basis points to 80 basis points, obviously the fourth quarter was very strong and part of that may have been a little bit of less restructuring actions, but is this business is to add tough times and slow growth for quite some time and you think the incrementals on this business as even if even 4% turns out to be the right number from a growth standpoint next year or in 2018 you should expect incrementals on this business to be very strong, so maybe talk a little bit about that within the context of your guidance your margin guidance like what the puts and takes for margins in 2018? Craig Arnold : I would say the electrical systems and services business is what we provided in the form of guidance is that we expect 40% incremental rate all in for Eaton inclusive of the restructuring benefit. And I would say that business does tend to perform a little higher than that and others inside the business perhaps are a little lower. But I would say that all of the benefits associated with the restructuring and the 4% ramp that we are seeing there fully baked into the guidance that we are reflecting inside the company. As we do continue to invest in the business across the board and we think that the numbers that we are proposing in terms of the guidance for 2018 are very much reflective on what we would expect from the business at this point in the cycle. Joe Ritchie : Okay, that\u2019s helpful Craig. Maybe asking this a little bit differently, I guess if I would think about potential headwinds for 2018 and specifically as it relates this business I would think perhaps price cost you still have commodity inflation, so I would be curious to hear how you guys are managing that and whether 2018 should be better than 2017. And I guess secondly the other thing we are just kind of seeing just from a logistics perspective it seems like things are getting a lot tighter from a truck capacity perspective, so any commentary on like freight costs as well would be helpful? Craig Arnold : I think it\u2019s clear that as we think about price versus costs going into 2018, we think 2018 is a better year and easier year than 2017. You recall that we experienced a bunch of unanticipated material cost inflation in 2018 and we are basically chasing it all year. But you see the same reports that I do. We are not really seeing commodity prices let up at all, but I can tell you that the businesses today are very well positioned to react and respond and to manage in this increasing environment of commodity cost increases. And so as we think about 2018 we don\u2019t expect commodity prices for the full year create an issue for us as our teams work on plans and initiatives to either pass it through to the marketplace or to offset it with a number of different cost on productivity initiatives that we have inside of the business. And to your point around truck capacity, absolutely we are seeing a little tightness there and that\u2019s part of I think what you see in the form of the strength in the North America Class 8 market as orders continue to drive up strongly. And that\u2019s because there is a bit of capacity tightness there and it is being reflected in freight rates and so that\u2019s once again though all fully baked into the guidance that we provided. Joe Ritchie : Helpful color. Thanks guys. Nice quarter. Don Bullock : Our next question comes from Steven Winoker with UBS. Steven Winoker : Hi, thanks and good morning all. Craig Arnold : Alright. Steven Winoker : Hey, just Craig you just finished this multiyear restructuring program as you noted and that was an enormous effort that you have been talking about for years and really one of the main focuses of the organization. So, it begs the question on that front what\u2019s next around continuous productivity and additional restructuring, are you finished or where are you on the path now? Craig Arnold : Yes, what I\u2019d say is no, we are not finished. And then as we noted earlier that we said it, you don\u2019t always want to think about an underlying rate of restructuring spending in the business and we originally targeted a number of $60 million to $70 million. And as we talked about on our guidance for 2018, well it\u2019s been $90 million. And so we really do believe there is infinite capacity to continue to improve things to do things better or different to be more efficient. And so I don\u2019t think we ever really run out of an opportunity for the foreseeable future to continue to find good programs to invest in, that results in us reducing our costs and building a more efficient organization. And so it\u2019s too early to give you a guide beyond 2018, but I think you can count on us just with a consistent cadence of spending dollars of restructuring to continue to drive margin expansion. Steven Winoker : Focused in any particular business units though? Craig Arnold : Yes. I think you can generally think about in the context of the high, the margin business, the less need there is for restructuring. I think you get to a point in some of these businesses where you over-toggle. So I just think \u2013 you just think about in the context of the margins and the lower the margins the probably the higher participation those businesses will be in the restructuring programs. And keep in mind it will always be fully embedded in the guidance that we provide. Steven Winoker : Great. And that is best practice. And I know on ES&S, you last I think hit what 14.4% or so in 2013, so you are getting there. You would be thinking go beyond it? Craig Arnold : Yes, absolutely. I mean, we can keep in mind and that business is just starting to cycle up too in terms of some of the key end markets that we participate in. So, we fully would expect \u2013 we are not going to give you another range, right, we have provided a range of 13% to 16% as a range through the cycle for that business. And so we are not in a position yet to change that range, but absolutely, we would expect it to continue to improve. Steven Winoker : And sorry, one last, any detail behind the lower incrementals on the products front in this last quarter, I know it\u2019s a high-margin business, but there are any particular dynamics that work? Craig Arnold : I appreciate the question and we are overall pleased with the margins. There were really two things inside of our Electrical Products that impacted us in Q4. One, we had a mix issue in our European business and nothing to worry about, we just had a number of very large shipments at the end of the year of products that has carried a much lower margin than we typically see in that business, but once again, a one-time kind of event. And the other thing if you recall we highlighted earlier that we would be dealing with in Q4 some of the fallout of the hurricanes that we experienced in Puerto Rico and that also impacted our margin. So, when you factor in, factor out those two events, our margins would have been 19.6% and a 20 basis point improvement versus prior year. Steven Winoker : Okay, very helpful. I am glad to see that the good work in Puerto Rico that you guys did. Thanks. Craig Arnold : Thank you. Don Bullock : Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Jeff Sprague : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Craig Arnold : Hi. Jeff Sprague : Just wanted to get just drill into the couple businesses, first maybe back to ESS, so in the opening remarks, you didn\u2019t mention utility at all or if you did I missed it, what do you see playing out in the utility space here as we exit 2017 and then what are you expecting for 2018? Craig Arnold : We see the utility markets continue to be in the low single-digit kind of growth range. And so if you think about that in the context of the overall electrical systems and services business and maybe it\u2019s a slight deduct from the 12%, but not much and that\u2019s really what we experienced during the course of 2017 in the U.S. market to specifically and that\u2019s really what we expect going forward. Jeff Sprague : And then on lighting, I mean, what you are saying is definitely not inconsistent with what we have heard from others, but what is your view on the disconnect if you will between relatively healthy commercial activity in lighting continuing the lag is the channel, is it share loss at the low end across the industry and you have a review on when lighting might reconnect with what\u2019s going on in the construction related markets? Craig Arnold : It really has been a bit of a conundrum, the market that has pretty consistently grown and grown faster than many of the other end markets that we saw this period of retrenchment or flatness in 2017. And it\u2019s really kind of consistent with our view going forward. I would say there is probably a couple of things going on and once again very much consistent with what you heard from others. We do think the market itself is probably more competitive today than it has been in the past as LED technology becomes more proven and more of a standard. We think certainly if you are probably seeing more competition, more price competition in that market than we have seen historically. And so we will have to wait and see how that plays through. We are certainly continuing to see the ramp in connected and controlled lighting. In fact our growth in that segment of the market was very handsome and very much consistent with what you heard from others, but it\u2019s not yet a big enough piece to offset the decline in the legacy part of the lighting. The other thing I would say on the positive side despite the fact that lighting overall as a category has been a little bit flattish, we continue to see growth in LED. In fact our LED business continue to grow nicely in Q4. Today LEDs represent 79% of our revenues and so that continues to be a positive for us. But it really is a bit of a wait and see story. We take a lot of confidence in the fact that buildings are built, they need lights and the end markets that we are serving continue to be quite robust, so where I think we are going to a little bit of a transition period right now and we will have to wait and see how it plays out longer term. Jeff Sprague : And one last one for me just on hydraulics, could you comment a little bit on hydraulics China and also are you to keep this good track of what\u2019s going on in the channel, any concern that maybe people are double ordering or anything here as we have kind of a scramble upward here? Craig Arnold : Specifically with respect to hydraulics China and what we are seeing there is very much consistent what we are seeing in the global hydraulics market which is a very significant ramp in the construction equipment market and the excavator market in China has been up over 100%. The rail loader market has been up 50%, so really strong growth that we are seeing out of China overall. And I do think to your point overall there is always a risk when you end up at this point in the cycle when lead times are starting to push out is always a risk that gets a little bit of over of ordering or booking early in the process. One of the reasons why you would say why 10% growth in hydraulics or orders about 25, because we do believe there is a little bit of timing associated with what\u2019s going on inside of that market. We will have to wait and see, I mean we really are encouraged by some of the retail sales numbers that you are seeing from some of the major equipment companies where retail sales are growing quite nicely. So it is a little bit of a wait and see in that market as well. But we think 10% is a number that\u2019s very much supported by what we have seen in other cycles and what we think we are ultimately delivering the business during the course of year. Jeff Sprague : Thank you very much. Don Bullock : Our next question comes from Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc. Jeff Hammond : Hi, good morning guys. Craig Arnold : Hi. Jeff Hammond : Just back on ESS, I mean any good lumpiness in the orders in 4Q that wouldn\u2019t repeat. And then just maybe as you think of quoting and talking to customers just the sustainability of this uptick you have seen in large projects and Crouse-Hinds? Craig Arnold : Yes. I would say not really. I wouldn\u2019t say that we have seen any particular one-time orders or things that would be suggest that the underlying order rate is not sustainable in our order book. And so no particular concern is there in the systems \u2013 large systems business or in Crouse-Hinds. And so the other \u2013 I am sorry the other part of your question was? Jeff Hammond : Based on quoting and customers as you look forward, sustainability around Crouse-Hinds in these large projects have upticked? Craig Arnold : I\u2019d say I would point to you one of the things that we track as we track negotiations. And so I would say that very much consistent with what we are seeing in our order book. Our negotiations for the year in that business which is a prerequisite for an order were actually up running up as well kind of mid-teen levels. And so we are also seeing overall economic activity negotiations to be essentially growing at the same rate as the underlying orders and that\u2019s really encouraging for the future. Jeff Hammond : That\u2019s great. And then just on the \u2013 to understand on the comments Eaton JV, so the JV income is that going to run through Vehicle segment Op income and just update us on when you think that the income from that JV starts to ramp? Craig Arnold : The ramp is yes, it will run through the Vehicle segment. And in terms of when the incomes starts to ramp know, I can tell you today that we are investing heavily in the joint venture. One of the big kind of reasons why we have made the decisions to partner with Cummins in this particular space is because we saw an opportunity to really accelerate our growth by introducing some new products and doing some things that would allow us to expand beyond our historical customer base. And so at this point we are not prepared to give you a longer term forecast of an income while the new say we were still significantly in the investment mode and so we would not expect in 2018 to see income come out of a joint venture as we continue to invest for growth. Rick Fearon : And yes, we have already built in the expectations of that investment into this 2018 guidance. Jeff Hammond : Okay, great. Thanks Craig. Craig Arnold : Sure. Don Bullock : Our next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC. Andrew Krill : Thank you. Good morning. This is Andrew Krill on for Deane. I was hoping can you give us some of your big picture views on non-resis for 2018, I think a lot of people have been concerned it could be choppy, but it seems to continue to grind higher, so any color you can give there? Thank you. Craig Arnold : I could say in terms of non-resi markets, I would say that the way we think about it is that it\u2019s kind of no real change from what we experienced during the course of 2017. We think little magnitude. We think growth in the 4% range is kind of the consensus number out there as well from the other forecasting organizations. And so like we think in many ways, it\u2019s almost a little bit of a repeat from what we experienced in 2017. The one thing that could be a potential upside to that if we end up with an infrastructure bill at some point in the U.S., some of these numbers could get better down the road. But right now we are planning on pretty much a repeat of what we experienced in 2017. Andrew Krill : Okay, got it. And then just a follow-up, I think one or your other like foreign domicile peers also know the dynamic where their tax rates should kind of go up in the out years, can you just give us any more insight into like the technicalities driving that? Thank you, Rick Fearon : Yes. I will address that. As we said we believe our rate for \u201818 will be 13% to 15%. We think \u201819 and beyond it only goes up one percentage point, so to a rate of 14% to 16%. And it goes up partly because the tax bill does have some elements that do ramp in. In \u201818 there is a partial ramp and then in \u201819 there is a larger ramp. But we think that stabilizing in the 14% to 16% range seems to us to be a pretty good result and will be we think relative to most other multinationals an attractive rate. I would make one other or maybe two other comments here, because there have been some things written on our taxes that we are just not correct. I want to make sure everybody understands. I saw one analyst that suggested that because of the tax bill that we might need to change our manufacturing footprint and that is just not correct. We don\u2019t believe that there will be any need to make any significant changes of the footprint as a result of the tax bill. And secondly, there was a comment that our \u2013 the treatment of our dividend from a tax perspective would change and that isn\u2019t correct either because, at least in the intermediate term we continue to believe that our dividend will be 100% return of capital. And that means for U.S. shareholders there will be no present tax owed down it. And then at some point in the future, if our dividend ever became other than return of capital, the taxation of that dividend, the rates applied to it would be the same as applied in the other corporation based in the United States. And so I just wanted to make those clarifications. Andrew Krill : Okay, great. Thank you, guys. Don Bullock : Our next question comes from Tim Thein with Citigroup. Tim Thein : Great. Good morning, just going back to that the comments earlier on the JV with Cummins, on the truck orders for \u2013 in North America on the heavy duty side, Craig what\u2019s the split or what are you anticipating the split to be in terms of AMTs versus manuals, just thinking about how your underlying growth will track this normal build rates? Craig Arnold : Yes. I don\u2019t have that exact split, but clearly AMTs are continuing to grow and manuals are continuing to decline. I can get you the further details through Don after the call. Tim Thein : Okay, understood. And then and maybe you touched a lot of markets within ES&S, but maybe just a word on power quality more broadly, obviously impacting both single and 3-phase but just curious in terms of what\u2019s embedded in the outlook here for 2018? Craig Arnold : Yes. And thanks for the question. Certainly power quality was one of the more disappointing market in 2017. And as we take a look at 2018 the single phase is the power quality. I think you will recall that we report it to our electrical products business. And the three phase will report to our systems and services business. And we think the power quality markets in 2018 we think grow in the range of low single-digit, so we think they have a better year than they had in 2017. And we think that\u2019s another one of the positive kind of year-over-year impetuses for growth is certainly our electrical systems and services business. Tim Thein : Okay. Thank you. Don Bullock : Our next question comes from Andy Casey with Wells Fargo. Andy Casey : Good morning everybody. Craig Arnold : Good morning Andy. Andy Casey : Can you \u2013 I guess can you comment on capital redeployment specifically on whether the acquisition pipeline activities picked up because the balance sheet is net debt to total cap solidly mid-20s, pension fully funded, heavy lifting from a management capacity for margin improvement seems to be down, I am just wondering where we should expect some of the improved cash flow to be allocated other than share repo? Rick Fearon : Andy, it\u2019s Rick. We are spending much more time looking at targets and evaluating situations. Valuation levels are high as you well know and you also know that we have been incredibly disciplined and we will continue to be incredibly disciplined as we look at acquisitions. So I can\u2019t tell you exactly what we might get done this year, but rest assure that we understand that we have very adequate capital. And we would like to find ways to augment our growth and to augment the strategic position of our various businesses. But it\u2019s just hard to figure out exactly what will economically make sense over the course of the year. Craig Arnold : Having said that, I would just add that what we have always said is that the first call on capital is to reinvest in our businesses to drive organic growth. And we certainly look forward to sharing with this group one way to get over New York some of the organic growth initiatives that we are investing in that really take advantage of some of the secular trends that are impacting our businesses. And so we think we have some exciting opportunities to invest in are internally to drive organic growth that perhaps can help bridge some of that gap. Andy Casey : Okay. Thank you. And then a little bit more specific on vehicle, you anticipate a part of the question on revenue, but even with that flat margin year-to-year at the midpoint seems a little bit muted, is that flat performance due to the accelerated investment into the JV that you mentioned or do you expect vehicle to see a little bit more restructuring this year than it did last year? Craig Arnold : What I would say the way to think about it, once you can appreciate the question is it\u2019s really investment, I mean it\u2019s investment and we will talk a little about this. And when we get together in New York it\u2019s really investment in some new technologies and electrification and so we are really taking this opportunity to reinvest in the business to really position the business to generate organic growth going forward. Andy Casey : Okay, thank you very much. Don Bullock : Our next question comes from Mig Dobre with Baird. Mig Dobre : Yes, good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in. Just a clarification, so the guidance implies $26 million lower restructuring cost in \u201818 versus \u201817 can you remind us what the incremental savings are? Rick Fearon : Mig, what we have said is that we really going forward are not going to try to reconcile costs \u2013 restructuring costs and savings every year. It frankly is just everyday activity. And so we simply wanted to note that we had earlier said perhaps we would on a regular basis spend $60 million to $70 million on restructuring and we are going to spend a little bit more than that, but we are just going to treat it as regular operations and not get into the details on expected savings. Craig Arnold : And the way to think about as we said at this point in the cycle, we would typically perhaps deliver a 25% incremental and one of the reasons why we are delivering a 40% incremental is because those restructuring benefits are flowing through. So, our way of thinking about calibrating the benefits that we are seeing in company. Mig Dobre : Yes. I am trying to understand when I look at your first quarter guidance talking about 40 basis points on margin expansion versus the full year. I am trying to figure out how the costs and the savings and whatnot are coming through to net debt? Craig Arnold : Yes. I mean, certainly, we always \u2013 I mean, if you think about the restructuring in general it\u2019s always more front-end loaded than it is back-end loaded. So, I think you are probably seeing some of the impact associated with just timing of spending and benefits throughout the year. Mig Dobre : Okay. Then last question for me back to ESS margins, so if I look at your revenue in this segment down something like $800 million over the last 3 years, things were difficult. I guess when you look at that 13% to 16% target range that you put out there for margin, I am wondering at what revenue level do you think it\u2019s appropriate for us to be thinking that you can reach the high-end of that range? Rick Fearon : We will address that in a little more detail at our New York conference. We have not modeled that exactly at this point, but clearly you are going to need a step up in revenues from what we expect this year given how far revenues have fallen in that business. Mig Dobre : Alright, thanks. Don Bullock : Our next question comes from Ann Duignan with JPMorgan. Ann Duignan : Hi, good morning. Craig Arnold : Hi. Ann Duignan : Hi, just on vehicle, your outlook for organic growth of 1%. I had always assumed that on the transmission side for our heavy duty north market trucks that you were still going to be kind of contract manufacturing and therefore your volume in trucks should be similar to the industry volume growth. Am I missing something? Craig Arnold : It\u2019s in the way to think about the impact of the joint venture and then how it impacts the vehicle businesses. First of all, there is a year-over-year deduct right because the joint venture was formed at the middle part of last year. And so you have to take out the revenues that we enjoyed in 2017 out of 2018 as those revenues will now be reported and started a joint venture and Cummins will consolidate. And the other thing I would think about is that a lot of the growth that we are seeing in our markets in 2018 is coming out of North America Class 8 truck and that growth once again will show up not in Eaton\u2019s revenue, it will show up in joint ventures revenue where we don\u2019t consolidate. And so we do participate slightly because we are selling components into the joint venture, but the denominator, the base of that is quite small. And so that\u2019s why you probably see a number that\u2019s perhaps more muted than you would have modeled for the vehicle segment. Ann Duignan : Okay. So, I guess when I was liking at organic revenue growth guidance, I was thinking that you had with apples-to-apples, but I should take into consideration? Craig Arnold : You really have to deduct the JV revenues and then you have to factor in how much of the growth is going to show up in the joint venture not in our vehicle business. Ann Duignan : Yes, okay. I got it. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And then just a quick kind of more philosophical question, do you need to be in the lighting business long-term, I mean is there strategic reason why you would need to be in that business? Craig Arnold : The way we think about lighting is no different in the way we think about the rest of the portfolio. We have set very specific goals with respect to every one of these businesses have to be good businesses in their own right. They have to stand on their own two feet. And so lighting is no different than the way we view hydraulics or vehicle or anything else. And we constantly look at these businesses and say is it a good business in it\u2019s own way, will it add to our growth, can it deliver the margin targets that we anticipate and so every one of our businesses go through that screen. Are there some synergies associated with going through similar distributors, sure there are some. But even having said that, every business has to stand on its own two feet and that\u2019s the way we view lighting and it\u2019s very much consistent with the way we view every piece of the portfolio. Ann Duignan : Okay, I appreciate it. Thank you. Don Bullock : At this point, we want to wrap up the call. I know there are a number of other callers today. We want to be respectful of those we have got to move on to other calls. So, we are going to wrap up the call today here at 11.00. I do want to as always we are available for follow-up questions. Thank you very much for joining us today. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today.

Chris Laserinko - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Eaton First Quarter Earnings Call. For the conference, all the participant lines are in a listen-only mode. There will be an opportunity for your questions. Instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I'll turn the call now over to Mr. Don Bullock, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead sir. Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: Good morning. I'm Don Bullock, Eaton's Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you for joining us for today for Eaton's first quarter 2018 earnings call. With me today as usual are Craig Arnold, our Chairman and CEO and Rick Fearon, our Vice Chairman and Chief Financial and Planning Officer. Our agenda today includes opening remarks by Craig, highlighting the company's performance in the first quarter along with our outlook for 2018. As we've done on our past calls, we'll be taking questions at the end of Craig's comments. The press release from our earnings announcement this morning and the presentation are posted on our website at www.eaton.com. Please note that the press release and presentation include reconciliations to non-GAAP measures. A webcast of the call will be accessible on our website and will be available for replay. Before I get started, I do want to remind you that our comments today will include some statements on expected future results of the company and as therefore are forward looking statements. The actual results may differ from those from our forecasted protections to a whole wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in both the earnings release and the presentation and they're also outlined in our 8-K. With that I'll turn it over to Craig to go through the presentation. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Okay. Thanks, Don. Appreciate it. Hey, before I dive into Q1 results this morning, I thought I'd take a moment to just reiterate three key elements of the strategy that we've been working on as a company and how we're focusing on growing the company, expanding margins and really effectively allocating capital. First, our organic growth initiative really is focused on new technology, how we're leveraging our channel and service capabilities, creating products that play across the entire spectrum of our customers' requirements, what we call delivering superior value. Next we intend to continue to expand our margins by restructuring to eliminate fixed costs, to drive operational improvements across our plants and functions, and we're being more selective in where we invest; what we call fixing the tail and growing the head. Finally, we continue to be good stewards of capital, first by investing in our existing businesses, playing to win in every business that we're in, returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks and being disciplined in our approach to M&A. By consistently doing these three things well, we believe we'll drive superior value for our shareholders both in the short term and over the long term. And we made solid progress in Q1. A few examples that we've noted on page four. We launched our new eMobility segment targeted at growth in electric vehicles. A $2 billion to $4 billion opportunity for Eaton and we're clearly working this opportunity with 30 plus pursuits that we're working on as we speak. And we'll certainly talk about this more later in the presentation. We continue to make progress towards our goal of digitally enabling our product portfolio including addressing the necessary infrastructure needed to ensure industry approvals and needed security protocols. We launched a new Microgrid initiative in Africa, combining our expertise in Microgrid management with energy storage. And we also had a very successful quarter growing our penetration in hyperscale data centers with over $60 million of new wins in the quarter. We launched a new Power Xpert circuit breaker product line for the harsh, hazardous and corrosive circuit protection market, a market that we believe is $500 million in size and a new opportunity for us to serve it. And lastly, we continue to execute on our ongoing restructuring actions and completed three site closures in the quarter. So while not an exhaustive list, we thought it would be helpful to provide a few notable examples of progress that we're making towards our strategy. Now turning to our financial results for Q1 on page five, I'll just add a bit of color to what you've already seen in our reported results. Earnings per share were $1.10, up 15% over Q1 2017 and at the high end of our guidance range of $1 to $1.10. Our results were primarily driven by strong revenues, up 8% over Q1. This is driven by 6% organic growth, the highest growth that we reported since Q4 of 2011. And foreign exchange added 3% or approximately $150 million to reported revenues. We had expected $150 million of forex for the entire year, so certainly a strong start there as well. Booking strength continued in the quarter with notable growth in Hydraulics and another quarter of strength in Electrical Systems & Services. Our operating cash flow in the quarter was $339 million. And if you recall, Q1 is typically our weakest quarter of cash flow generation. In addition, we're adding working capital to support higher growth in the quarter and a stronger outlook for the year. We repurchased $300 million of our shares in the quarter and are on track to repurchase $800 million in shares for the full year. And finally, we increased our dividend by 10%. This is consistent with our long term goal of growing our dividend in line with our long term earnings. Turning to page six, we show a summary of the income statement for the quarter. Here I point out that our 8% growth was made up of 6% organic, 3% FX, offset by negative 1% due to the divestiture in Electrical Systems & Services and the formation of the Eaton Cummins joint venture last year. Margins were 15.2%, 80 basis points above prior year and a Q1 record. We think a good indication that our restructuring plans are paying off. Consistent with our plans, our incremental margins on organic growth were approximately 30% in the quarter and we remain confident in our ability to achieve 40% incrementals for the full year. We did see good volume leverage in the quarter, generating 12% net income growth on 2% organic growth and we expect this relationship to improve as the year unfolds. Moving into the segments, I will begin with Electrical Products. Our revenues were up 5% with 1% organic growth. Sales in this segment were impacted by our Lighting business which was down approximately 10% in the quarter. Excluding the impact of Lighting, organic growth in the segment was 6%, so strong growth excluding Lighting. Maybe just a word on Lighting weakness. The weakness was driven primarily by what you've seen, reported weak markets. There were also a number of large projects in last year's results and management's decision, quite frankly, not to chase some unattractive projects during the quarter. We do expect Lighting to have a relatively better next three quarters. And consistent with our prior guidance, we think the business will be down mid-single-digit for the year. For the remainder of the business, we saw strength in a number of end markets with particular strength in products going into industrial applications. And geographically, we saw strength in Europe and in North America. Bookings were down 2% in the quarter, also driven by Lighting weakness. Excluding Lighting, bookings were up 2% with strength in Power Distribution Components and Industrial Controls. Notably, our margins in the quarter were up 30 basis points over the first quarter, a first quarter record as well. The results for Electrical Systems & Services are on page eight. Revenues were up 4% in the quarter with organic up 2.3%. We rounded it to 2% on the chart. Foreign exchange was up 2.2%. We also rounded it to 2% on the chart. And the divestiture of our stake in a small joint venture reduced revenues by approximately 1%. In the quarter, we saw market strength in services in harsh and hazardous and power distribution assemblies for industrial markets. And geographically, the U.S. markets saw the greatest strength. Bookings in the quarter were up 8% on strength in industrial projects and in services. And as we noted in Q4, our backlog for industrial projects continued to expand and as a result, we would expect to see organic growth accelerate beginning in the second quarter. I'd also note that our operating margins improved by 50 basis points in this segment. Next, taking a look at the Hydraulics business, sales were very strong, up 21% with organic revenues up 16% and foreign exchange adding 5%. In the quarter, all regions were up significantly with particular strength in construction equipment and through the distribution channel. Bookings were up 14% in the quarter with strength coming primarily from OEM customers and really all end markets. And we also saw booking strength across all geographies. Given our very large backlog, we expect this market will remain strong throughout 2018. Margins were 12.7% in the quarter, up 250 basis points over Q1 2017 and we continue to see the benefits of our restructuring efforts as well as the benefits of higher revenues. Now we continue to experience some challenges as we continue to ramp this business in the face of very strong demand levels, but we do expect to see improvements beginning in Q2. And we're certainly on track to deliver our full year margin guidance in this segment. For Aerospace, we had another strong quarter. We saw 7% sales growth with 6% organic. Sales growth was driven primarily by strength in military which was up 13%. And the military strength extended across really all categories including the military aftermarket. Always lumpy orders in the quarter were up 1% on aftermarket and strength in rotorcraft offset by weakness in both military and commercial transport. And margins were 19.4%, up 90 basis points over last year and once again, a Q1 record. We also had a very strong quarter in the Vehicle business. Sales up 14%, of which organic revenues were up 13%. Foreign exchange added 3% and the divestiture impact from the joint venture formation with Cummins was a negative 2%. NAFTA heavy duty truck production was up 45% in the quarter and also Brazil truck and bus was up nearly 6%. So lots of strength in our truck business around the world. In addition, order strength continued through the quarter. We now expect NAFTA heavy duty production will be 295,000 units in 2018, significantly higher than the outlook of 275,000 that we had at the start of the year. U.S. and China light vehicle markets are expected to be flat for the year. Europe a bit better. And strong growth in the emerging markets, specifically in India and Brazil. Margins were 14.8% in the quarter, up 110 basis points on better than expected revenue and benefits from prior restructuring efforts. Margins, while good, were held back somewhat by higher restructuring costs in this quarter and we certainly expect them to improve in the out quarters. Page 12 is a first look at the financial results of our eMobility segment. You'll find 2016 results for eMobility, including the restatement of our Electrical Products and Vehicle segments in our 10-Q which will be out later today. Sales in the quarter were $77 million, up 22% from prior year, 19% coming from organic growth. The organic growth in the quarter was driven by new European electric vehicle penetration and growth in electrical products going in traditional internal combustion engine applications in North America. Margins in the quarter were 14.3%. This is down from prior year due to additional R&D investment and spending on specific customer programs. This is an exciting new segment for Eaton and we expect to see double-digit growth in this segment for some time to come. So before we move into the remainder of the year, I do want to provide some additional background on our new eMobility segment for those who may not have had an opportunity to join us at our investment conference in New York. eMobility is really a great example of how we're capturing synergies across the company, in this case, to pursue emerging market opportunities in electric vehicles. So what are we doing? In simple terms we're combining the unique industry knowledge, customer relationships and, I'd say, application knowledge from our Vehicle business with the proven technology that we've created in our Electrical business. All of the technologies and products that are needed to support electric vehicles were already selling in homes and factories and offices in our Electrical business. More development and customer specific changes are certainly needed, but this is exactly what our Vehicle business does very well. And electrification is a good thing for Eaton. Our addressable content per vehicle is actually 8 to 10 times greater on an electric vehicle than it is on an internal combustion engine. So just turning to page 14, electrification of vehicles will no doubt be a very large market and we've decided to really focus on those areas where we can create the right to win and have unique technology. On page 14, we show you the specifics of where we intend to focus and that's in power electronics and conversion and on power distribution and circuit protection. You can see from the description that these technologies are critical to the safe and reliable operation of the vehicle. But what you really can't see is what we already do. And that's \u2013 we have a very large business in both of these technologies across our electrical markets. We're a market leader in power conversion from our UPS business and in power distribution and circuit protection from both our Bussmann fuses as well as our legacy circuit breaker business. We're already selling many of the electrical products into both electric vehicles and into internal combustion engine markets, and look forward to exploring the opportunity to expanding this opportunity as the electric vehicle market continues to grow. On page 15, we included an outlook for 2018. And here we expect revenues to be approximately $320 million, 12% organic growth. And we think the segment will deliver 12% and 13% full year margins. Our margins were down versus 2017 as a result of a significant step up in R&D spending and where we expect to spend approximately $30 million in this segment for the year. More importantly, I'd say we expect a serve a market that will grow to over $33 billion over the next 10 years or so, and we think Eaton can capture $2 billion to $4 billion of additional revenue by that same timeframe. So we're working with a number of global OEMs as we speak and are certainly excited about the opportunity to make eMobility a meaningful part of the company. At this point I'll turn to our outlook which is on page 15. Excuse me, page 16. We now expect organic revenues to grow 5% for the year up 1% from prior estimates driven by, as you can see here, an increase in both Hydraulics and Vehicle. We expect Hydraulics to be up an additional 3% and now forecast a 13% increase for the year and Vehicle to be up an additional 3% and we now expect a 4% increase for the year. The other segments are unchanged from our prior guidance. And for margins on page 17, we're increasing our segment margin guidance for Eaton from 16.4% to 17% or 16.7% at the midpoint, up from our prior guidance of 16.6% at the midpoint. We're also raising the margin expectations for our Vehicle segment to 16.5% to 17.1% for the year. And as we noted last year, we'd only intend to change margin guidance for our segments when they're outside of the prior guidance or ranges provided, hence the increase in Vehicle. And our other segments remain unchanged as our expectations for the year continue to be within the prior ranges. On page 18, we provide a summary of Q2 and our 2018 guidance. For Q2 we expect EPS of $1.25 to $1.35. This assumes 5% organic growth, margins of 16.2% to 16. 8%, and a tax rate of 11.5% and 12.5%. For the full year we now expect EPS of $5.10 to $5.30, up $0.10 at the midpoint from our prior guidance; organic revenues of 5%, up 1%. We think foreign exchange will be a positive $250 million now, $100 million above our prior guidance. We think segment margins are now expected to be, as I noted, 16.4% to 17%. Corporate expenses will be slightly higher than what we originally forecasted, $10 million above 2017. The prior guidance was flat. And we expect our tax rate to be down modestly with a range of 12.5% to 14.5%, down from our prior guidance of 13% to 15%. Cash flow, CapEx, share repurchase and restructuring cost assumptions are really unchanged from the prior guidance. And so just before I turn things back to Don for Q&A, I did want to once again take this opportunity to summarize why we think Eaton is a very attractive investment opportunity. The first I'd say, our markets have returned to growth and we think the next three years will be better than the last three. In addition, we have a number of attractive organic growth initiatives that we think will allow us to grow faster than our end markets. Our restructuring is paying off. Our margins will be at an all time high in 2018, and we expect our margins to continue to improve. Our balance sheet is in great shape. Net debt to capital is below 30%. Our pension plan is now funded at over 95%. Our cash flow continues to be strong and we expect to consistently deliver cash flow at or above 100% of net income, while generating $8 billion of free cash flow over the next three years. And we're also returning cash to shareholders through a high dividend yield. Our dividend today is north of 3.5% and we're buying back shares, 1% to 2% on an ongoing basis. And lastly, we'll deliver 11% to 12% EPS growth over the next three years. So we think it's a fairly compelling story and, once again, a very good reason to take another look at how you view the stock. So with those opening comments, I'll pause and turn it back to Don for Q&A Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: Operator's going to provide you instructions for the Q&A. But before I do, I would like to remind you that we have a large number of questions on the call today, and I'd ask you that you \u2013 to try to keep it at an hour today, I'd ask you sort of keep your questions \u2013 limit your questions to a single question and a follow-up. And with that, I'll turn it over to the operator to give you instructions. Operator : Thank you. Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: Our first question today comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hey, good morning, guys. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Morning. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Craig, can we maybe just start on Lighting for a second? It's been a bit of a drag on growth in orders for the last several quarters and I'm just curious, like, how are you guys thinking about this business internally just from a strategic perspective? And how important is it to the overall portfolio? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yeah. I appreciate the question. First of all, I'd say that the Lighting results in Q1 were certainly were below our expectations as a company, but very much in line with our outlook for the year. As we said back in New York, we thought this would be the one segment inside the company that would be under pressure during the course of the year. And so we still believe, down low single digit is very much in line with our thinking when we set our plan at the beginning of the year. And to your point around strategically how we view Lighting, I'd say Lighting, very much like the rest of the company, has to live up to our company's expectations around the criteria that we set for what an attractive business looks like. And we talked about it being \u2013 businesses have to be leaders in their markets. They have to grow in excess of GDP. They have to deliver attractive return on sale and attractive return on net asset. And where we're in cyclical businesses, they have to deliver a minimum level of profitability. And so I would say, the Lighting business inside of Eaton today is a business that has a lot of positive things and a lot positives going on, but it's also a business, I would say, today that still has something to prove. And so with respect to Lighting, we have work to do to turn this into the type of business that meets all of Eaton's criteria for businesses that we want to be in. So we continue to invest, we continue to like many of the prospects, but we clearly have something to prove in this business. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: That's helpful color, Craig. And maybe for my second question, if I could just focus on ESS growth in orders. Clearly, the order momentum is there. It sounds like large project activity is picking up. No change to the organic growth guidance, but you're expecting an acceleration in 2Q. So maybe just provide a little bit of commentary around your thoughts on growth for the remainder of the year, the acceleration that's expected. And whether this is one where potentially we could get outside the range, just given how strong the order momentum has been. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yeah. I mean, at this point, I think, I would say, it's early in the year and, but perhaps too early to make a change to the guidance. But we are, in fact, seeing very strong growth in our Electrical Systems & Services business, driven as we said at the beginning of the year, by power distribution, large assemblies, harsh and hazardous markets, the Crouse-Hinds business, and certainly, today we're really seeing perhaps even more strength than we originally anticipated in our three-phase power quality business. And so our negotiations are up solidly for Q1 as well. And so we certainly are hopeful that this business continues to grow at the rate that we expect and we'll have to take another look at it in Q2. But at this point, we think the guidance that we provided is prudent and we're optimistic that this business continues to grow not only in 2018, but we think the outlook for the next few years for our Electrical Systems & Services business is quite positive. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Good to hear. Thanks, guys. I'll get back in queue. Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: Our next question comes from Steve Winoker with UBS. Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Hi. Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC : Hi. Can you maybe just give a little more color on the incremental walk that you're talking about for the rest of the year? I know obviously restructuring and you got the benefits from that, maybe pricing actions versus material and wage inflation and productivity. Just little more color for how that's progressing given the 1Q performance. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yes, and I'd say that if we think about our incremental performance in Q1, they were in fact largely in line with what our own expectations were as we've built our profit plan . And so we were quite pleased overall with how we did in Q1. And as you think about why things will improve in subsequent quarters, I'd say there's really two pieces. You hit on one. It's restructuring, net spending versus benefits and those are certainly will increase in each of the subsequent quarters. And the other thing I would say is that our net price versus commodity inflation performance will actually improve as well as the year unfolds. And so those are really the two, I'd say things that will give us ultimately a lift in our margins. And we had some volume growth in some of our businesses as well. But those are really the two big ones that will generate incremental margins and incremental return on sales as the year unfolds. Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC : I would think that volume leverage would be very significant too given this large step up you're looking at for the rest of the year. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yeah, absolutely. We also see a benefit there. Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC : And just following up on your pricing point, so what \u2013 in terms of actions that you've taken versus those that are kind of being phased in through the rest of the year, would you say that you're about a quarter of the way through those pricing actions? Have you taken more of them? Just some perspective on that. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Sure. Yeah, maybe the first thing, just to go back to what we said in New York. We talked about what \u2013 we anticipated that Section 232 would have an impact of roughly $50 million. Well that impact has been significantly reduced with all of the exceptions that have been made in terms of countries that are no longer in scope or potentially no longer in scope, and we'll see how it finally unfolds. But that number went from 50 million down to about 10 million. Secondly, I'd say that inside of our businesses, we have already either taken or announced price increases in each of our businesses that essentially offset or more than offset the commodity inflation that we anticipate and can see at this point. As we take a look at commodities in general, they're certainly running at higher levels than we planned originally. But our teams have gotten out in front. We've already, as I mentioned, taken price increases or announced price increases. And we're fairly confident that we don't expect commodity price inflation to be a drag on margins at all for us this year. Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC : All right. Thanks, Craig. I'll hand it on. Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: Our next question comes from Ann Duignan with JPMorgan. Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Morning. Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Most of the operational questions have been addressed so I'd like to focus maybe on your comments on eMobility. Craig, I think you said that the content opportunity for Eaton is 8 to 10 times versus an internal combustion engine. Was that reference just to gasoline engines or was that also diesel engines? Because if I recall, you probably have more content on a diesel engine than you do on a spark-ignition engine. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yeah. First maybe just to clarify that point. And no, we don't have more content on diesel than we do a gasoline engine. We have content on both platforms and we're not necessarily biased to one or the other. And perhaps one of the pieces that you reference is the whole diesel issue in Europe and how that would impact the company. And for us, it won't have an impact at all. Those become gasoline engines, we're just as well positioned as if they would be a diesel engine. Ann, but to your other point, yeah, absolutely. I mean, if you think about the content available to Eaton as the world moves to more electric vehicles and commercial vehicles and off-road equipment, our opportunity as a company, it really does increase by 8 to 10 times. And that's simply the electrical content on those vehicles versus the content today that we would sell in the form of valves and valve actuation and superchargers and other product that you would typically find on an internal combustion engine. So for us it's an exciting opportunity and we think a real growth opportunity and the reason why we launched this eMobility initiative and are putting so much resource behind it. Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And this may be an unfair question for a conference call and quarter conference call, but are there any lessons learned from the penetration of LED lighting that can be used in eMobility? I mean I look at the world and I see companies like (29:44) have already also created an eMobility segment. Are there any lessons learned from conversion of industries where you can take the learnings from one division to another? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yeah, I think there absolutely is, Ann. And I think if there's one message and if you had our Lighting team on a call they would probably say play to win and make the early investments and bet on the technology winning. And that's exactly way we're approaching the eMobility opportunity. That's one of the reasons why the margins are down in 2018 in eMobility is because we were investing heavily in that segment. So we clearly intend to play to win and to play to win globally and our teams are excited by the opportunity. Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. I'll leave it there and get back in line. I appreciate it. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Thanks Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks. Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: Our next question comes from Scott Davis with Melius Research. Scott Davis - Melius Research LLC : Hi. Good morning, guys. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Morning. Scott Davis - Melius Research LLC : Hi. Just following up a little bit with Ann on eMobility. I mean, I don't know what scale looks like in eMobility. It's still early days, but do you feel like you have enough? I mean, I look at the product portfolio and you're really strong in circuit protection and power conversion but there's a lot of electricals on the car. I mean, does it change your M&A strategy or the things that you'd like to have or think about bolting on that you've sent your M&A guys out to explore? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yeah. The first thing I'd say is as we think about kind of the places where we've decided to play around power conversion, power distribution, I'd say we're really leveraging the strength of what we do today. We have a very large Electrical business today where we provide exactly the same types of technology in buildings. And so I think one of the real advantages that Eaton has versus other companies who are approaching this opportunity, we have the ability to leverage existing technology and leverage the scale that we already get through participating in these technologies in our Electrical business. Having said that, there is obviously customer specific modifications that will be required. And in many cases we'll have to make some additional investments and we're certainly view this as a segment that we'd be willing to look at M&A opportunities and partnerships in. But I think we're in a great starting position because we do have this very strong base of technology and knowhow and customer intimacy through our Vehicle business. Scott Davis - Melius Research LLC : Makes sense. And just to again go back to \u2013 a couple folks have asked about Lighting and I'll ask about it too. I mean, when Eaton bought Cooper, I mean, most of us I think felt that Eaton might sell their Lighting business. It was something that was easy to parse off and it's an industry that's desperately in need of some level of consolidation it appears. But do you need to be in the lighting business? And at what point do you just say, we're fighting too many wars here? I mean, you're trying to build an eMobility business at the same time you're \u2013 gosh, you've got lots of SKUs here. And do you need to be in lighting? And how much time are you going to give it? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yeah, no, what I'd say is, first of all, I think we have an attractive Lighting business. We are arguably the second largest lighting LED supplier in the North America market and have really enviable positions with a full product range. And so I'd say today, if you think about as lighting businesses go, we have one of the most attractive lighting businesses we think in the world. And so it's an attractive business in the context of the markets in which we compete. Yeah, and in some cases we are, in fact, leveraging some common distributors. But I'd say do we have to be in lighting? Does it have a negative impact on the balance of our Electrical businesses if we're not in it? I'd say no. But one of the things we've said in general as we think about the company, every one of the businesses that are part of Eaton has to stand on its own. It has to be a good business in its own right to earn the right to continue to be part of the company. And so no different than the criteria that we've set for Hydraulics or Vehicle or any part of the company, we have to prove that this is a good business in its own right. And if there's other synergistic things that it brings to the table as a part of Electrical, that's fine, but the first thing we have to do is demonstrate that this is going to be a good business as a standalone business inside of the company. And so we think we're working on all the right things to make improvements. But as we said with any part of the company, if we get to the point where we don't believe it can live up to our expectations, we'll be prepared to make other decisions. Scott Davis - Melius Research LLC : Good answer. Thanks guys, and good luck to you. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Thanks. Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Hi, thank you. Good morning, everyone. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Hi. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Hey, sorry to come back to Lighting again, but just a few other things to clarify if I could. I think, Craig, in your opening remarks you said you thought it would be down mid-single-digit for the year. But I think in response to a question you said low. So could you clarify that as point one? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yeah. I mean I'd say that, kind of parsing numbers at this point, but I'd say low-single-digit is currently the viewpoint on the business in terms of where we think it'll end. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : And then I was actually more curious just actually on the size of Lighting. For it to be a 5-point impact on organic growth and down 10% implies the business is a fair amount bigger than I thought it was, like in the neighborhood of $3 billion plus or so. Is there some other adjustment you're making when you talk about how much it's down, maybe excluding the projects from last year? Or what other color could you give us on that? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yeah. I'm not sure about kind of the way you did the math, but it's not even \u2013 not close to $3 billion in revenue. So, I mean, we can maybe offline, help you with your model, but it's... Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc: Jeff let me just add, it's in the neighborhood of $1.5 billion to $1.75 billion. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Yeah. That's what I thought. Okay. Thank you very much. Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: Okay. Our next question comes from Mig Dobre with Baird. Mircea Dobre - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Yes. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Maybe going back to eMobility. Craig, help us maybe better understand the opportunity here. You're investing a lot in R&D. In order for you to win in this market, are we talking about you displacing already existing players? How would that process work over time? And how should people think about incremental margins here as we're thinking about beyond 2018 for this segment? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yeah. Yeah, appreciate the question. And I'd say that for us what's most exciting about this opportunity is that, no, we don't have to displace existing companies in this space as electrification is largely a new market today without a number of established competitors. And so really it's a wide open space today and the ultimate kind of winners in this space are yet to be determined. So we think, if you think about what Eaton brings to the table, we have as much of a right to win in this space as anyone, given what we do in our Electrical business. And so we do believe that it's going to be a great opportunity. Yes, to your point, lots of companies are pursuing eMobility and electrification. I think the two areas in which we've chosen to focus are places where we are uniquely situated and have unique capabilities. And we think, if you think about the business long term, yes, some relatively large upfront investments. But we think, long term, we think the margins in this segment also become very much attractive and in line with the rest of the company. Mircea Dobre - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then my follow-up, maybe kind of a small modeling clarification. Is there a way to quantify the price cost drag that you had in the first quarter? And I want to make sure that I'm clear on this. You're basically saying that you're going to be neutral in, going forward or in the back half of the year on that, right? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yeah. And we're not going to \u2013 we won't specify specifically Q1, but I will say that as you think about the back \u2013 beginning in Q2 and the back half of the year, the price cost equation for us is better than it was in Q1. So despite the fact that we reported record margins in Q1, for Q1, we did have a little bit of drag and it gets better as the year unfolds. Mircea Dobre - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: And you're going to be neutral by year end 2018? Are you going to catch up with that? Or... Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yeah. We will basically be neutral. Commodity costs will not be an issue for us at all this year. Mircea Dobre - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. Appreciate it. Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. Good morning. Maybe just trying to understand within Electrical Products, I think the margin guide for the year is for that to be up maybe close to 100 points or so at the mid-point. Q1 is starting out some way below that. I understand maybe there's some volume leverage as Lighting comes back. But I guess in the past when Lighting revenues grew a lot, it was called out as a mix headwind to margins. So I guess I'm trying to understand what gets the EP margin momentum improving over the next three quarters? And whether Lighting sales recovering is a contributor or a headwind to that process. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yeah, I'd say the way to really think about it is there's a fair amount of cyclicality in this business in general. And so our Electrical businesses typically have higher volumes in the second half of the year. And so Q1 has always been historically a, relatively speaking, tough to call north of 17% margins low. But for that business, it's always been kind of the weakest quarter. So there's the seasonality as a function of volume that impacts Q1 and positively impacts the subsequent quarters. And then as I mentioned as the price cost equation improves as the year unfolds and we start to see even greater restructuring benefits in our business as the year unfolds. Those would be the three elements that I'd say that would result in the better margins as the year unwinds in the Electrical Products segment. Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.: So Lighting should be sort of a neutral impact on... Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yeah. Lighting is \u2013 the changes in revenue are not going to have a material impact at all on the margins. Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Very clear. Thank you. And then my follow-up would just be on capital deployment. You have the guidance of $800 million share buyback spending I think retained for this year as a whole. You spent $300 million in Q1. Should we think that if the share price stays around where it is, that $800 million guidance starts to look pretty conservative? Are you trying to be sort of deliberately opportunistic here on the amount spent on buybacks? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: You know, I think very much consistent with what we said is that we will generate a lot of cash this year and we don't intend to let cash build up on the balance sheet. Our first priority is clearly investing in our businesses which we're doing. We have committed to a very strong dividend and $800 million of share buyback. But in the event that our stock price kind of continues to languish at the levels that it's at right now, we find our stock to be very attractive as an opportunity to accelerate buybacks or to buy back more. So that continues to be an option that we're considering. And we're obviously considering that in the context of obviously other opportunities around M&A. But at the current pricing levels, we find our stock to be very attractive. Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thank you. Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: Our next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Hi. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hey. I'm going to avoid the penalty for piling on, on another Lighting question. So I just wanted to get some clarity on one of the businesses that you highlighted at the beginning in terms of accomplishments in the first quarter, the increased penetration in hyperscale data center market which has \u2013 that whole market has changed so much in the past couple of years. That market's expectations and use of UPS is drastically different from what mainstream data centers use. So how is it that you've been able to address this market? Is in particularly is it new products? Is it service? And what's the opportunity from here? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yeah, no, I think to your point, it's actually a very attractive market and if you think about today when \u2013 the data center markets today, most of what we sell into the data center markets actually is in our core electrical distribution business. And yes, we have a very big footprint as well in power quality, but it's a very positive story for our electrical distribution business as well. And I'd say so much of what's going on today, it's not so much new products as much as it is most of our major customers building out their infrastructure to try to keep up with this massive generation and consumption of data that we all tend to generate. And so I would put it as more in terms of the market fundamentals, the secular trends that we all live with every day that's requiring that our customers build out more infrastructure. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Great. And then just a follow-up question for Rick. Can you give any color regarding the tax rate being tweaked lower on the year? Is this any further clarification on tax reform or is it something very company specific? Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc: It's really company-specific. We've now had a chance to digest all of the complexities of the tax bill. And we've made some adjustments to our own structure and plans that allowed us to pull the rate down a little bit. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Got it. Thank you. Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: Our next question comes from Steve Volkmann with Oppenheimer. I'm sorry, Steve Volkmann with Jefferies. I apologize. Stephen Edward Volkmann - Jefferies LLC : Good morning. I thought I hadn't changed. Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: Sorry, I didn't mean to preclude an announcement there. Sorry, Steve. Stephen Edward Volkmann - Jefferies LLC : Thanks. Who know, maybe you will be prescient. But anyway, I will risk the piling on penalty. Just one more quick one on Lighting. Craig, are there pieces of Lighting that are doing well? And I guess what I'm trying to get at is if you had to restructure the business just to control what you can control because the market is what it is, are there things you could do that would improve that business? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yeah, and I'd say we're always working to restructure businesses to focus on \u2013 one of the things we talked about across the company is that in every business it's a normal distribution of \u2013 there's always things that are going very well or with attractive margins. There's always pieces of every business, even an attractive business, where there's opportunities to improve them. What we call grow the head, fix the tail. And so that initiative really cuts across the company and Lighting is no different. And we're certainly looking at opportunities to just be more focused in our Lighting business on those places where we have a unique technology and the right to win and looking at the other marginal activities where they tend to be more commoditized. And so I'd say that is absolutely a piece of the formula in Lighting. It's really a piece of the formula in the way we run all of our businesses. Stephen Edward Volkmann - Jefferies LLC : Okay fair enough. And then maybe on ESS. Traditionally when that business starts to grow backlog, there's an opportunity to improve pricing and sort of the margin that's in the backlog. As you look into the backlog, is that happening? Should we be expecting better margin in the backlog? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yeah, what I'd say without commenting specifically on margin in the backlog, I think your general thesis is correct. In this environment where our Electrical Systems & Services business is growing, we are in fact building backlog. Orders are growing. It makes the opportunity to get price that much easier. And so I do think we are all fortuitous at this point in the cycle where we are in fact experiencing some commodity inflation. But at the same time, markets are very strong. And in many of our facilities, we are pushing lead times out because many of our factories are sold out. And so it's a very positive environment climate in general to get price. Stephen Edward Volkmann - Jefferies LLC : Great. Thank you so much. Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: Our next question comes from Chris Glynn, who actually is with Oppenheimer. Chris, by the way I'll be seeing my optometrist a little later in the day to get this problem fixed. Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Thanks. You can buy our in-house optom. So just on Hydraulics, I think about 24% reported incrementals depending on how FX plays here. Maybe low relative to the full year Eaton targets around 40%. I know you've been fighting some market ramp inefficiencies there, but wondering what you think Hydraulics incremental should be showing here in terms of internal views absent ramp inefficiencies. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: No, I think the number you quoted is a very good number. We think 40% incremental is the right incremental level to think about for our Hydraulics business. And to your point, we certainly have been experiencing some ramp inefficiencies as orders continue to run and outstrip our supply chain's ability to respond. And so we're expediting and running a lot more overtime and not as efficiently as we would ordinarily run as we try to catch this ramp in the cycle. But I think 40% is absolutely the right number. And as I mentioned, we think that business, once again as we look forward, we think it starts to deliver much more consistently with those kinds of expectations. Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Okay great. And then I'll take a penalty for the team there and go back to Lighting. Just wondering on the volume declines what the relative impact roughly is between \u2013 you called out large project comps versus specifically how you serve the market being more selective there. The point being the latter might actually be stable or favorable to margins. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yeah, and in terms of parsing the two, I'd say \u2013 I can't say that one was a more significant of an issue than the other. Both projects that did not repeat and being more selective around business that we take, both contributed to the decline in Q1. But I would say as we look forward and very much consistent with what we saw in the month of April, we think most of that's behind us at this point. And we're comfortable with our forecast for the year and our guidance for the year. Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Great, thank you. Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: Our next question comes from Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc. Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Hey, good morning, guys. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Hi. Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Just on EPG I guess outside of Lighting. I guess the orders came in a little bit more sluggish. You cited industrial. Maybe just speak to the construction markets, res, non-res, any anomalies there and kind of how you think that the orders play out. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yeah. I'd say that we really have not seen any dramatic changes from what we forecasted or anticipated in the Electrical Products businesses with the exception of perhaps a little bit of weakness we talked about in Lighting. Industrial markets continue to do fine. We think industrial markets are up 3% to 4%. Residential markets continue to be quite strong, so we think those markets continue to grow mid-single-digit. So we think by and large that our outlook for the year for our Electrical Products business and the key markets that they serve really have not changed much from our original guidance. Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc: And I might add, Jeff, it's early. We don't have a full accounting of orders for April but the orders for April appear to be pretty strong. So we're seeing a continuation of strong conditions in the product segment. Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay great. And then just back on eMobility margins, is it right to think about for the foreseeable future we're in the low-double digits as you invest? Or do we start to move back up to a level we saw I guess in the last year period? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yeah, I would say that as we go through this kind of investment cycle which we think is really kind of a at least a couple-years kind of investment profile, we're going to be seeing margins at these levels. And you probably won't get back to the higher levels of margins until we get to a much higher level of revenue. Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thanks guys. Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: Our next question comes from Rob McCarthy with Stifel. Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Good morning, everyone. Two questions. So following up on two of the topics. Number one on Lighting. From my math, it would seem to suggest that kind of core volume declines or \u2013 excuse me, core declines is close to 15% to 20% which is pretty significant. Do you think there's going to have to be incremental restructuring or anything you're going to have to do internally that's going to be a lodestone to operating margin there? And could you comment qualitatively on any decremental leverage off that decline? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yeah. I'm not sure how your math gets to those levels. Our Lighting revenues in Q1 were down 10%, and actually our profitability was essentially maintained. And so, we delivered margins that were very much in line with our expectations in Q1 on a 10% revenue decline. And as we look forward, as I mentioned, we think Lighting obviously, on a go forward basis, we have much better quarters in front of us than we had in Q1. And we think the margins of this business continue to be very much in line with our expectations. And so we're not particularly concerned about a decremental margin issue in Lighting that's going to have any impact on our business at all. Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: All right. I'll table those questions offline. I guess, then the next question is obviously a statement of drag. Going back to Julian's question about capital allocation, it would seem to me that obviously your preference is probably for M&A. But given this environment with where the stock is, there's a pretty significant market break here and kind of speed kills in terms of capital allocation and what you can do, particularly in the prevailing environment with cash repatriation, the strength of your balance sheet, the free cash flow generation. Don't you think there's going to be some upward bias to think about expanding this buyback pretty significantly? Because that seems to be the best use of your capital at this point in time. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yeah. I just think at this point it's just too early to make a call on that, and because we promise, we will not allow cash to build up on the balance sheet. And to the extent that we don't have attractive M&A opportunities that deliver better returns, we'll certainly be very aggressive in buying back our stock. Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thanks. Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: Our last question for the day comes from Andy Casey with Wells Fargo. Chris Laserinko - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hey, guys. This is Chris Laserinko on for Andy. Just a couple follow ups and I wonder if I could zoom out a little bit for bigger picture. As we looked at the orders in the release, it seemed like there was a little bit of a slowing compared to the prior quarter's order growth rates. Is this mostly related to comparisons? Or are you seeing anything sequentially weaken as you work through the backlog? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yeah. No, we're really not, and as Rick indicated, we're actually seeing some strength carried through in the month of April. And so, I'd say, there's always a little lumpiness in some of the businesses like Aerospace, so I wouldn't read anything into that. We came off of a very strong 2017 order input. Hydraulics, a little less strong but our orders were up 22% in Q1 last year and we're up 14% on top of that. And many of this is simply a function of cyclicality or a function of what's in the denominator from last year. But no weakening at all. We're very confident that the order profile that we've seen so far this year is very much consistent with our guidance. Chris Laserinko - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. And I wonder if you could talk about company incrementals as a whole. Is the 40% target for the company as a whole still good? And I wonder if you could comment on what drove specifically the under leveraging in Q1. Also what you'd have to have in place to achieve it. Is that more volume related, price-cost related, combination of both, plus additional things that I might be missing? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yeah, no. I think it's the things that you mentioned. It's volume leverage. It's price-costs where we're certainly much better balanced in the subsequent three quarters as I mentioned earlier. It's the net of restructuring spending and restructuring benefits. And so the incrementals that we delivered in Q1 were very much in line with our guidance for the year which ties out to a 40% incremental for the year. And we're very much committed to that number and that's very much consistent with what our expectations are for the year. We've seen nothing today in our businesses that will suggest that we will not deliver the 40% incremental. Chris Laserinko - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. And I wonder if I could sneak one in \u2013 since I'm the last one. In terms of the eMobility, could you comment on what the revenue ramp for the rest of the year looks like, and maybe about product introductions or leveraging the existing technology in the medium-term, in the next two years? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yeah. Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc: There isn't going to be a gigantic ramp. You're going to see just a relatively modest ramp as you go through the quarters. And obviously we are working very hard on a whole variety of customer projects right now and that will impact a little bit the spending depending on whether we end up going forward on some of these projects. So those are the two dimensions. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: And I think largely it'll be tied to our customers and the rate at which they introduce new electric platforms. And so you'll clearly see a step function change in revenue in this business as the big global OEMs introduce new electric vehicle platforms. And so that's really the pacing item more than anything. Chris Laserinko - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thanks very much for that. I appreciate the color. Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: With that, it wraps up our call for today. As always Chip and I will be available for follow-up questions for the remainder of the day and into the rest of the week. Thank you for your time today. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Later we will conduct a question and answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Don Bullock. Please go ahead. Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: Good morning. I'm Don Bullock, Eaton's Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you all for joining us for today for Eaton's Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. With me today are Craig Arnold, our Chairman and CEO; and Rick Fearon, our Vice Chairman and Chief Financial and Planning Officer. Our agenda today includes opening remarks by Craig, highlighting both the performance in the second quarter and our outlook for the remainder of 2018. As we've done historically in our past calls, we'll be taking questions at the end of Craig's comments. Before we do, I want to remind you of a couple of things. First, the press release from our earnings announcement this morning and the presentation we'll go through today have been posted at our website at www.eaton.com. Please note that the press release and the presentation both include reconciliations to any non-GAAP measures, and a webcast of today's call is going to be accessible on our website and is available for replay for those who aren't able to join us. Before we get started, I do want to remind you that our comments today will include statements related to expected future results of the company and are therefore forward-looking statements. Actual results can differ materially from those forecasted projections due to a whole range of risk and uncertainties that are described both in the earnings release and our presentation and our related 8-K. With that behind us, I'll turn it over to Craig to go through our presentation. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Okay. Thanks, Don. Appreciate it. Just before we get started with Q2 results, I did want to take an opportunity to once again emphasize the three primary elements of our corporate strategy. I'm sure you've worked through most of the financials already, but first and foremost, we remain focused as a company on delivering organic growth. Our initiatives are very specific by business, but generally they include investing to create industry-leading products and technologies, leveraging partnerships with distributors and third parties, creating value products and services that allow us to more fully participate across the opportunities we see. So in short, what we're trying to do is find opportunities to say yes more often and doing it in a way that solves customer problems but also delivers attractive returns. Second, we continue to expand our margins by improving productivity in our factories and in our functions and by selectively undertaking restructuring initiatives that allow us to eliminate redundancies, eliminate waste and really being more selective on how we spend our time moving away from marginal activities, but just as importantly, doubling down on those areas where we have the right to win with attractive returns. Third, we'll maintain our disciplined approach to capital allocation which begins with investing to win in all of our existing businesses. We'll also consistently return cash to shareholders in the form of industry-leading dividends, share repurchases, and by maintaining our rigor as we evaluate M&A opportunities against our hurdle rate. We think by continuously delivering on these components, we'll generate superior value for our shareholders both in the short-term and the long-term. And in the context of that kind of strategic overview, we also thought we'd take an opportunity to just highlight once again this quarter a number of places where we've made a bit of progress against these strategic initiatives. And on page four, I've highlighted a few of the examples. First, in our efforts to grow, I point to our presence in the fast-growing data center market which continues to pay off. In fact, we booked record orders in the first half of the year. We're seeing strong global demand for new facilities in hyperscale and Internet 2.0 applications, and importantly, we're winning in this space. We also entered into a new joint venture with Shaanxi Fast Gear for light duty transmissions to serve the Chinese market. The JV combines Eaton's broad transmission technology with the leading transmission company in China and allows us to participate in the world's largest light vehicle market. We also made solid progress on our digitization initiatives, and while too many to note, I would point out a few examples of progress made in the quarter. We launched an IoT enabled home lighting solution. We deployed an IoT enabled hydraulic system in sugar cane harvest applications as well as in hydraulic fracturing. We formed an industry cybersecurity partnership with the Rochester Institute of Technology which allows us to advance the common and secure IoT platform that we intend to deploy on all of our products. And so really solid progress as we continue to digitize the company and focus on opportunities to grow with these new technologies. And while just getting started, we did secure our first high voltage converter order in our newly formed eMobility segment. And lastly, we added significant capacity to our hydraulics hose business enabling us to sharply reduce lead times and expand our presence in the high volume segment of the market. So while not a complete list, these are examples that hopefully provide you with a sense of how we're moving our strategic priorities forward and how we're also investing in the future. Now turning to our financial results for Q2 on page five, I'll just add some context to what you've already seen in the results. First of all, we think a very strong quarter of performance by our businesses. Earnings at $1.39, up 21% over Q2 of 2017 and at the high end of our guidance range. Our performance was driven by both strong revenue and record margins. Organic revenue up 7% was actually the highest reported growth since Q4 2011. FX added 1% offset by 1% in divestitures. Bookings accelerated in most segments, but especially in Electrical Systems & Services and Aerospace, which were both up solid double digit. We generated all-time record segment margins of 17% based upon strong volume growth and strong incrementals, and we think once again demonstrated the ongoing benefits of our multiyear restructuring program and how those benefits are coming true. Operating cash flow was $499 million in the quarter, and while not as strong as you might have expected, cash was impacted by adding working capital to support increased growth as well as by selectively pre-buying inventory to mitigate impacts of the trade tariffs. And finally, we repurchased $300 million of our shares in the quarter bringing year to date purchases to $600 million, 1.7% of shares outstanding at the start of the year. So we think really strong, balanced performance across the company. Turning to page six, we'll provide a summary of the consolidated results for the quarter, and here I just highlight a couple of elements of the income statement. We talked about the sales increase which really allowed us to increase segment operating margins by 16% and net income by 18%, earnings per share up 21% in Q2, and this compares to 15% in Q1. And lastly, we did deliver 11.1% after-tax margins in the quarter. Moving to the segments, I'll start with Electrical Products. Our revenues were up 4%, 3% coming from organic growth, and this is up from the 1% growth we reported in Q1. In the quarter, we saw particular revenue strength in industrial markets, especially in the Americas and the EMEA market, Europe, Middle East and Africa. Total bookings were up 4% in the quarter, and excluding Lighting, bookings were actually up 7%, which is a step up from Q1 bookings where, also excluding Lighting, they increased 2%. So this business is also ramping favorably. Order strength was broad, driven by both industrial and residential markets. I would also note that lighting markets appear to have stabilized, and we expect to see low single digit market growth in the second half of the year. Importantly, our margins in the quarter were up 120 basis points to 18.5%, which is a second quarter record. So strong conversion in our Electrical Products business. Next, the results for our Electrical Systems & Service business is on page eight. Revenues increased a solid 7% in the quarter, and this is up from the 2% growth that we saw in Q1. Foreign exchange added 1% which was offset by negative 1% from a small divestiture in a joint venture. In the quarter, we saw revenue strength in industrial projects, in data centers, and solid growth in harsh and hazardous markets. We generate very strong bookings growth of 15% with strength in the Americas and Asia Pacific and bookings were especially strong in large industrial projects and in data centers. And our backlog continued to grow increasing 14% in the quarter, and we think position the business well for continued growth in the second half of 2018 and certainly into 2019 as well. Operating margins were 15%, up 130 basis points, and we delivered strong leverage as the 7% sales increase resulted in a 17% increase in operating profits. Moving to page nine, here we cover the Hydraulics results. Sales increased 14% in the quarter, 13% organic, 1% positive FX. Revenues were strong with both mobile OEMs and across the distribution channel. Bookings were actually down 1% in the quarter, and this does take a little bit of an explanation, but this included Asia Pacific up 15%, the Americas up 4%, offset by EMEA down 21%. And while impacting orders, the lower EMEA number is actually the result of our operational improvements and capacity investments that we've made to shorten delivery lead times, and this has reduced naturally our customers' need to place long-dated orders And certainly when we take a look at our backlog, it increased some 26% year to date and this certainly gives us confidence that this market remains strong. Margins at 14% were up 230 basis points, so we continue to see the benefits of restructuring efforts here as well as leverage from the higher volume. However, I would note as we discussed on prior calls, we continue to experience challenges as we ramp up production to support the strong growth levels and most of the challenges are coming from the supply base which has really struggled to keep pace with the higher demand. Next, our Aerospace business is listed on page 10. Sales were up 6%, all organic. The sales growth was driven by strong activity in military OE across all segments, biz jets and commercial aftermarket. Orders were even stronger, up 18%, with strength in both military and commercial aftermarket, business jet, military fighters and military rotorcraft. Our backlog also remains strong and is up 13% over prior year. And lastly, operating margins were once again very strong, 19.4% and up 90 basis points over prior year. Turning to page 11, our Vehicle business had another strong quarter. Sales increased 6%. Organic revenues were actually up 11% and the divestiture impact of the joint venture that we formed with Cummins was a negative 5%. NAFTA heavy duty truck production was up 15% in Q2 following more than 40% in Q1. So this market continues to be very strong. We continue to expect NAFTA heavy duty truck production to be at 295,000 units for 2018 which implies a modest growth in the second half of the year on more difficult comps. And I'd also note that the industry is seeing a few supplier challenges that will likely limit second half production but pushing production into 2019. And in the automotive markets, both Europe and China are stronger than we originally anticipated and the U.S. market is really coming in about on expectations. So really broad strength in our Vehicle business. I'd also note that the Eaton Cummins joint venture is doing well. Revenues grew to $141 million in the quarter, so very strong growth in our joint venture. And margins were at 18.5%, up 180 basis points from prior year on strong revenue. And finally, results in our eMobility segment are shown on slide 12. Sales in the quarter were up 15%, 14% organic, and having just formed the business in Q1, we're pleased to announce that we have in fact won our first high voltage converter order, one of the key products that we've just begun selling into the electrical vehicle market. And our pipeline of opportunities perhaps more importantly is 2X what it was in Q1, so we continue to see tremendous growth in the opportunities that we're having an opportunity to quote on for customers. Margins were 16.9%, down 120 basis points reflecting really the additional R&D investment but very much in line with our expectations. On page 13, we've updated our organic growth outlook for 2018. Our end markets continue to grow above our original expectations in a number of our businesses and so we're increasing our full-year organic growth estimate from 5% to 6%. The continued strength in orders from Electrical Systems & Services has led to an acceleration of organic growth and we're now forecasting growth of 6%. We're also increasing the organic growth outlook for our Aerospace business to 6% on strength in both military and commercial markets. And finally, our Vehicle business continues to perform at a high level and we're increasing our organic growth guidance to 6% for the full year as well. You'll also recall that we increased our Vehicle segment organic growth estimate following a strong Q1 as well. Overall, a 1% change for Eaton and this is on top of the 1% increase that we provided as a part of our Q1 guidance. Moving to page 14, we'd like to provide just a bit of perspective on where we think our businesses are in the economic cycle and why we think conditions are setting up well for the second half 2018 and really going into 2019. Now, as this chart demonstrates, we think that our end markets are currently \u2013 where our end markets are currently at in terms of the economic cycle. As you can see, most of our end markets are in the early to mid-growth stage, which we think bodes well for continued market growth. The majority of Eaton's revenue comes from businesses that are in the early to mid part of the growth cycle, and this includes many of our larger businesses like long-cycle Electrical Systems & Services segment. So overall, we think our businesses will continue to have a market tailwind for some time to come, and we would expect to, as well, grow faster than our end markets. On page 15, we provide an update on our thoughts regarding raw material inflation as well as the estimated impact from tariffs. As we communicated at the beginning of the year, we continue to execute on our strategy of offsetting raw material and logistics cost inflation with price and cost out actions. We moved quickly with pricing actions in the first half of 2018, and as a result, we expect no negative EPS impact in 2018 from additional commodity inflation. With regard to tariffs, we think there will be a very modest cost impact for our businesses overall, some $65 million. But we also fully expect to mitigate this increase through actions that are currently underway or will shortly be implemented in our businesses. So I won't go through the tariff details in a lot of detail, but I would emphasize kind of the two main points. And one, our long-term strategy has been and continues to be to manufacture in the same zone in which we sell, and this certainly reduces the tariff impact on Eaton. And secondly, we're committed to move swiftly to take pricing actions to offset any tariff impact that we do see in our businesses. Moving to margin guidance on slide 16, we're increasing margins for three of our segments where we're seeing stronger than expected organic growth and solid performance. These include Electrical Systems & Services, up 20 basis points; Aerospace, up 30 basis points; and Vehicle up 50 basis points. We are lowering our guidance for Hydraulics to a range of 13.7% to 14.3%, which is a 50 basis points reduction at the midpoint. This is in response to supply chain challenges and inefficiencies as volume continues to grow at these strong paces. And our full-year margin guidance remains in the range of 16.4% to 17% and really places us on a solid trajectory to achieve our 17% to 18% margin targets that we set for 2020. And finally on page 17, we provide a summary of our Q3 and 2018 guidance. For Q3, we expect EPS of between $1.35 and $1.45, and this assumes 7% organic growth. We expect margins to be 16.9% to 17.3%, and a tax rate of 13% to 14%. For the full year 2018, we are again increasing our full-year EPS guidance to a range of $5.20 to $5.40, which is a 10% increase at the midpoint. Organic revenue growth is now expected to be up 6% versus 5% previously. Foreign exchange is now expected to be only a $50 million positive which is down from the $200 million that we had in our prior estimate. Segment margins will be in the 16.4% to 17%, as earlier noted. No change in our cash flow or free cash flow guidance, and corporate expenses, tax rate, CapEx share repurchase assumptions all remain unchanged from prior guidance. So just before I hand it back to Don, I did want to once again take this opportunity to summarize why we think Eaton is an attractive investment opportunity. As you can see, and we talked about, our markets have returned to growth. The next few years will be much better than the last few. In addition, we have a number of really attractive organic growth initiatives that we think will allow us to continue to grow faster than our end markets. And our restructuring is paying off. Our 2018 margins will be at an all-time high, and we have plenty of room to continue to improve them. Our balance sheet is in great shape. Net debt-to-capital is at 30%, and our pension plan is now 96% funded. Our cash flow continues to be strong, and we expect to consistently deliver free cash flow at or above 100% of net income while generating some $8 billion of free cash flow over the next three years. We're also returning cash to shareholders through a high dividend yield, 3.3% today, and buying back shares 1% to 2% on an ongoing basis. And lastly, as we committed, we'll deliver 11% to 12% EPS growth over the next three years, and so we think once again solid performance this quarter, a positive outlook, and we think a really compelling story for investing in Eaton. So with that, I'll stop and turn it back to Don for Q&A. Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: Okay. Our operator's going to provide guidance on participating in the Q&A. Operator : Thank you. Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: Before we jump into the Q&A, we do see we have a number of people on the call and we also have a number of calls going on simultaneously to this time so I want to be very sensitive to the timing of that. So if we would please limit yourself to a call and a follow-up call. And with that, our first question comes \u2013 question and follow-up question, excuse me. And our first question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Thank you. Good morning. Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc: Hi. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Hey. Great momentum. I think one interesting question given that you guys report a little later than others is what you're seeing in July. I'd say it's somewhat implicit in your Q3 guidance obviously, but was there some element of pre-buying or other activity in June as people were looking at tariffs? And did you see any let-up in July? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yeah, I think the short answer to the question, Jeff, is no. We really did not see any pre-buy of any measure, and what we've seen to date in July is very much consistent with the patterns that we've been seeing. So absolutely everything that we've forecasted in the outlook for the company is very much consistent with the way the businesses have been performing. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Right. And then just to be clear on price-cost, what you're saying is kind of underlying price-cost, you're caught up or have visibility on being caught up but there's still actions that need to be taken on tariffs? Can you clarify that? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: There's still a fair amount of uncertainty as it relates to the implementation of 301. And so what I would tell you is what we know about to date and what has been announced to date we have very much either announced or implemented plans to offset that impact. There's a lot of uncertainty as you think about the step 2, step 3 of 301 and what actually happens that obviously we don't have visibility into, and those actions, if they are implemented as speculated, then we would have to take additional actions down the road. But everything that we've seen to date and everything that's been announced to date is very much already baked into our guidance and plans are very much already implemented or in the phase of being implemented. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Thanks. I'll hold it to two and pass the baton. Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: Okay. Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc: Hi. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Morning. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: So organic bookings in ESS, obviously really good to see the progress that you're seeing there and finally seeing some of that growth materialize. Craig, my first question is maybe touch on what you're seeing from like a leading indicator perspective on the data center stuff, the industrial projects, and how you feel about that business on the go forward. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yeah, and I appreciate your question. Certainly the few big businesses that are inside of Electrical Systems & Services would include our power distribution and controls assemblies, our commercial distribution assemblies our power quality business and also Crouse-Hinds. And I'd say in all four of those very large businesses, we are seeing very strong order growth across the business. And so all four of those businesses are performing well. We talked about the fact that the backlog is up from 15%, and we saw strong orders, and those are the four businesses that are essentially driving the growth. And so very much as we anticipated for our Electrical Systems & Services business, perhaps even a little ahead of schedule, those businesses are late cycle businesses but are ramping right now and we expect to continue to perform for some time to come. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. That's great to hear. And then my second question maybe following up on Jeff's trade tariff question and more broadly on cost inflation. When you think about the different segments and your ability to offset cost inflation across the segments, where are you finding it the easiest or are you finding it difficult in some of your segments? Basically a question around pricing power and your ability to offset. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Sure. Again, and I'd say it's pretty much no different this cycle than it is any cycle. And to the extent that we're selling through distribution, distribution always tends to be a little easier. Price increases are good for our distributors, and they have the ability to pass it forward into the marketplace relatively easier. It's always more challenging with the big OEMs, but I would tell you that our plan's to pass it forward every place including in those places that have historically been a little bit more challenging. But I just think more generally speaking, distribution tends to be a bit easier than large OEMs, but we're not differentiating between the two. We're passing price increases equally through to all of our customers. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you. I'll pass it on. Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: Our next question comes from Scott Davis with Melius Research. Scott Reed Davis - Melius Research LLC : Hey. Good morning, guys. Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc: Hi. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Morning. Scott Reed Davis - Melius Research LLC : The positive benefit of putting up these kind of numbers is you're kicking off a lot of cash. And we've seen some of your peers have a fairly active M&A pipeline and some direct comp, some not. But what do you think as far as priorities are concerned? With the amount of cash you're kicking off, it almost doesn't feel like buybacks can really keep up to the \u2013 can almost not keep up to the growth. But is M&A something that think will come back this year? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: As we've stated in prior quarters, having paid down the last tranche of debt associated with the Cooper acquisition, the company is certainly in a position today both from an organizational capacity standpoint and from a cash standpoint that we have the ability today to re-enter the M&A market. And today I can tell you that we are looking at more opportunities than we have in quite some time. But having said that, we'll be disciplined as we think about how we value and price these transactions. We talk about a cost of capital of being 8% to 9% and saying we want a minimum of 300 basis points over our cost of capital. So we intend to be disciplined as we look at these opportunities. But having said that, we will not allow cash to build up on the balance sheet. To the extent that we're not able to land acquisitions, which we would hope to do, we'll certainly look for other ways of returning cash to shareholders. Scott Reed Davis - Melius Research LLC : Fair enough. And then as a follow-up, in the Lighting business, you mentioned a return to growth in the back half of the year. Is that \u2013 is there also a sense of price stability that you're finally seeing in that market explicitly? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yeah, I would say that as we talk about our own Lighting business and our own strategy with respect to Lighting is that we have made a decision to be perhaps more selective than others around business that we're chasing, and we made some adjustments in terms of where we focus our efforts. And I can tell you that as we think about the segments of the markets where we think are attractive and the places that we want to play, you generally see better pricing power, better pricing stability. I can't say if you think about the entire market at the low end of the market that that dynamic has changed dramatically. But the places that we anticipate playing and the places where we think we have an opportunity to sell differentiated value-added solutions, we do have a lot better pricing power in those markets. Scott Reed Davis - Melius Research LLC : Okay. Sounds good. Thank you, guys. Good luck. Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe. Nigel Coe - Wolfe Research LLC : Thanks. Good morning, guys. Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc: Hi. Nigel Coe - Wolfe Research LLC : So you called out data center as a strong end market, which shouldn't be a huge surprise, but I think it's the first time you've really specifically called data center end market strength. So I'm wondering is this pretty broad across geographies, or is it one of two super-sized data centers that you're starting to see coming through? And then just thinking about the ESS margins and we're starting to tilt now towards larger projects. Do you think that mix becomes a headwind as we go into the second half of the year, maybe 2019? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yeah, I'd say to your first question around data centers and to your point, Nigel, it's one of the big secular trends that we certainly think bodes well for Eaton and will help generate long-term growth for our company. And it is broad. We're seeing growth in the data center markets really around the world, and as you move to hyperscale and colos and as the world just generates more and more data, we think that trend will continue for some time and will continue broadly. To your other question around margins, no, we don't anticipate that margins will be under pressure in this business, and I'd say quite frankly today if we take a look at where the industry sits today in electrical assemblies, for the most part, we have capacity constraints. Some of the demand that we're seeing today in our business is really pressing us and others to really deal with a lot of volume that we're looking at, and we're certainly looking at potentially adding capacity to deal with some of this increased demand. And so, no, I don't anticipate at all that margins will come under pressure and given the balance of capacity and demand, I think the market's in a great position today to actually get price. Nigel Coe - Wolfe Research LLC : Great. Thanks. And a quick follow-on. Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc: I just wanted to add one thing. We've seen a bigger \u2013 a larger proportion of complex large industrial type projects, and those tend to have higher margins. Inherently there are fewer people that can actually pursue projects of that nature. So that's another element to the margin outlook. Nigel Coe - Wolfe Research LLC : Great. Thank you. And then quickly on the EP, it looked like Lighting was down roughly 10% in the quarter. Maybe you can clarify that. But what was the impact on operating leverage. You obviously had very strong margins for EP, but if we look at ex Lighting margins how did that look? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yeah, I'm not sure of your math, but we know Lighting was down closer to 4% in the quarter, not 10%. But I'd say that today I could just tell you that it's better. I mean, we've not given specific margin numbers for our Lighting business, and I would just tell you that the margins in Lighting are certainly below, well below the average for the Electrical Products segment. And so they certainly have a negative impact on the overall margins for the segment. But inside of that, we have a fairly large Lighting business and still posted 18.5% margins in Electrical Products which I think is a real testament to the strength of the franchise. Nigel Coe - Wolfe Research LLC : Great. Thank you. Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: Our next question comes from Nicole DeBlase with the Deutsche Bank. Nicole Deblase - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning, guys. Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc: Hi. Nicole Deblase - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: So I guess I want to start on ESS. If we look back into history since the Cooper acquisition, we've never really seen a real ESS recovery. So I guess if you could give us an idea of how order growth translates to revenue growth. Because it seems to me from the past three quarters that an acceleration in revenue growth could be in the cards. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yeah, no, that would be our expectation as well, and if you think about it today, what's in the backlog \u2013 typically I'd say what's in the backlog, most of that becomes consumed within the next 12 to 15 months, probably 75% to 80% of it. And so it is a longer lead time business from project to delivery, but it's not two years out or 18 months out. It's much nearer term than that. And so we do anticipate that the strong orders that we're seeing in our Electrical Systems & Services business convert in a relatively short period of time into higher revenue growth. Nicole Deblase - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Got it. Thanks, Craig. That's helpful. And maybe just one on Aerospace. Orders were also really, really strong there this quarter. I know that's a business that tends to see a lot of lumpiness. So if you could just frame the strength a little bit, where the growth was the strongest, and what your expectations are for the next several quarters. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yeah, I appreciate your comment too. It is a place where orders tend to be a bit lumpy. But we really did see, I'd say, in this quarter with respect to orders, pretty broad strength. A lot of that came out of military markets. Certainly pretty broad across all segments of military, and so you're seeing some of the increase in the U.S. federal spending come through in fleet readiness and dealing with some of the historical underspending perhaps in our military. But also we saw very strong strength in aftermarket. Both military and commercial aftermarket were both up strongly, and that's revenue passenger kilometers, people keep getting on planes flying and that's translating into higher aftermarket growth as well. So I'd say it's been a fairly broad-based strength. The one place you'd look at the biggest segment which is commercial transport, you have very strong numbers being posted by Boeing, Airbus a little less so, but we think Boeing \u2013 if Airbus, excuse me, delivers their second half of the year, there's probably more strength there as well. And, so we think it's a pretty broad-based increase in our Aerospace business, and as you know, these big commercial OEs are sitting on record backlogs that are growing every day. So it was a very successful Paris Air Show where both companies booked very strong orders, and so we really think the aerospace industry is really set up for growth for an extended period of time. Nicole Deblase - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks, Craig. Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: Our next question comes from Steven Winoker with UBS. Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC : Hey, thanks. Good morning, all. Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc: Hi. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Morning. Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC : Hey, so I just wanted to go back to Scott's question on the M&A front. Craig, you talked about kind of the usual 8% to 9% cost of capital plus 300 basis points over that that you're looking for. Just what kind of timeframe are you thinking about that you want to achieve those things? Given the step-up in M&A activity across a lot of your segments, I'm just trying to get a sense for the kind of competitive positioning that you have there. Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc: Typically if you look at how our past acquisitions have done, we typically start a little bit below that 300 basis points over the cost of capital, but then we end up by year three or so at the cost of capital and then above that as you get past year three. So that's as you work the synergies into the equation. Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC : But your discipline commentary means that you're not willing to see that stretch out these days because I think we are seeing that stretch out for a lot of M&A. Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc: Well, we are \u2013 we have always said we're cash on cash buyers. We look at the cash we put out and the cash that comes in, and the time value of money makes a difference. And so all of that goes into our thinking, and I think what Craig was trying to communicate is we will remain disciplined. If we believe there are significant synergies that are truly actuable, then that'll factor into our numbers. But we also, with all the experience we've had, we know that it sometimes takes longer than you think to generate them. Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: And it's always a matter of what the alternatives are as well. So we'll always look at as we think about discretionary cash, and the acquisitions will compete like everything else against other options for other investments that have also very strong returns. And I'd say we have a number of, whether it's organic growth or other ways of improving the effectiveness of the business, we have plenty of other opportunities we think to deploy cash in value creating ways. Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. And Craig, can you just comment a little more on that Hydraulics order rate in EMEA? I know it's capacity investment to reduce lead time such, but between that and some of the other supply based commentary, just wanted to get a sense of the organization's ability to keep up with demand across your network. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yeah, and I would say we are in fact seeing improvement. So we don't want to overplay that. We're seeing improvement in our ability; we're seeing improvement in the supply base. But having said that, it's come slower than what we anticipated. With respect to the orders in Europe, and what we do is when we take a look at our orders internally, we take a look at when orders are due, and we look at things due within the next three months, due within the next six months, due within the next six to 12 months. And what we've seen in Europe specifically is a significant reduction in orders that are basically the long lead-time orders. And we think while it doesn't show up favorably on our orders chart, that's really a confirmation and a testament to the fact that we're getting better operationally in delivering. We've made big investments in new capacity, and so our customers today are actually placing orders that are more close to what the real demand is. Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc: And if I could just add a couple of nuances to that. If you look in Europe, orders that we had in the second quarter due within three months, were actually up. Orders due past three months were down more than 50%. So we believe that that's because you no longer have to put these capacity reserving orders in. We simply have capacity. And we've added more than 10% capacity in our very large conveyance facility in Europe. Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC : All right. Makes a lot of sense. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: And we think the end markets continue to be strong. You obviously have seen a number of the companies in this space report, and at this point we think those markets continue to perform very well, and the underlying demand we think is still very strong. Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC : Makes sense. Thanks. Good luck. Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: Our next question comes from Ann Duignan with JPMorgan. Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yes. Good morning. Because we've had multiple companies reporting this morning, I'm going to ask you a simple math question. You've taken up your organic growth outlook, but you've maintained your margin guidance. So what is your revised incremental profit outlook versus the 40% you had guided to? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: The way I would think about really kind of maintaining the margin range is that we provide a range because essentially it gives us a fair amount of ability to move within that. And so I would not read or overread much into the fact that we haven't changed the range. Certainly our expectations are to be within that range and certainly the midpoint can move one way or another depending upon what your assumptions are. So I would say with respect to the fact that we didn't change the margin guidance, I would not overread that. There is in fact a fair amount of uncertainty around the second half of the year, and I think more than anything, the fact that we didn't move that is a reflection of the uncertainty that we see in the marketplace with respect to trade and other variables that it's really difficult to predict and control which way it's going to head. Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. But you were confident enough given your backlog in your orders to raise the organic growth outlook. Is that the way we should read that? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Exactly. It's exactly right. The backlog, as we talked about in a number of our businesses, whether it's Aerospace or Hydraulics or Electrical Systems & Services, the ones that build big backlogs continue to ramp, and so we think the backlog certainly provides a lot of confidence in our ability to continue to grow. Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And just a quick follow-up. Just on your early-stage growth, mid-stage, and late-stage, I wonder if you could give us more color on why you think that U.S. not-residential construction is only in mid stage. I mean, we've been expanding for eight years. It certainly feels like we're not going to fall off a cliff in the near term, but it certainly feels like we're in the later stages of expansion in U.S. non-residential construction. So if you could clarify that, I'd appreciate it. Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc: I guess I'd cite three things, Ann. First of all the expansion we've seen in non-resi thus far in this cycle has been quite modest, much more modest than you typically see in expansion cycles. So that's point one. Point two, if you look at this growth in oil and gas spending, typically oil and gas spending flows into a variety of non-residential categories, and we think that you will see that occur again this time just as you've seen in the past sometimes it'd flow downward when oil and gas activity goes down. But now we're, in our view, pretty clearly in an up cycle in the oil and gas markets. And then thirdly if you look at more minutely at the Dodge contract data, it is signaling that you are going to see acceleration as you get to the back half of this year and into 2019. And so those are the three elements that give us confidence that you're going to see some pretty good conditions in non-residential construction. Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And any of the subsegments within non-residential you'd expect more acceleration or less acceleration? And I'll leave it there. Thank you. Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc: I think you're going to see more acceleration in what I would call the heavier, the industrial, the oil and gas related type activities. Obviously you're also seeing it in things like data centers. Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. I appreciate it. Thank you. Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: Our next question comes from Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc. Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Hey. Good morning, guys. Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc: Hi. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Morning, Jeff. Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Hey. So a lot of discussion on supply chain. It seems like you've kind of alleviated some bottlenecks in Hydraulics yourselves. Just maybe talk about any signs of supply chain improving within Hydraulics and truck as we move through, and then conversely, any other businesses where you see it becoming a bigger problem. Thanks. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: I'd say that we are in fact seeing signs of improvement both in Hydraulics and in truck. And you've obviously, Jeff, have heard what others in the space have said around some of these specific bottlenecks in truck and how those things are finding a way of working theirselves through. But I'd say typically in a lot of these industries, you could be six months away from, in the worst case from a demand signal that says something is changing to the ability to flow all that demand back to the supply chain base. And so we obviously have seen both of these markets really ramping over the last 18 months, and we have been chasing it for 18 months. But I think today, we're on top of it and we have a much better sense for where these markets are going. So in simple terms, I'd say we have seen signs of improvement everyplace. We are getting better. Our suppliers are getting better. We're doing a much better job of shortening lead times, and we talked about that a little bit in our Hydraulics business in Europe which is giving our customers confidence. But at this point I'd say that we certainly \u2013 it took us longer to get here than we'd hoped, and that's why we're experiencing some of these inefficiencies. So I'd say overall I think things should be better going forward. Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. And then just in EPG, it seems like Lighting has been clouding the growth rates for some time, and think your pointing to a little bit of growth in the second half. Just looking at the other businesses, is there opportunity to see some growth acceleration in EPG just as the Lighting comps get easier? Thanks. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yeah. I think the Lighting comps get easier and I think our own business in Lighting actually has a better second half of the year. You saw the acceleration in EPG when you compare Q1 to Q2, and we would anticipate as you go into the back half of the year, that Lighting performs, relatively speaking, better. Somebody said easier comps, but the business, underlying business performs better and as a result, EPG performs better. Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc: And remember, Jeff, you still have a fair number, a fair amount of industrial components in EPG in the Products segment and in those parts of that business are going to benefit of course by growth in the commercial and industrial assembly businesses as well as just oil and gas activity. Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thanks, guys. Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: Our next question comes from Steve Volkmann with Jefferies. Stephen Edward Volkmann - Jefferies LLC : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Couple of quick follow-ups. It feels to me like you guys actually ought to have pretty good visibility into 2019 when you look at some of this data center stuff we've talked about, ESS orders, Aerospace, some of the truck stuff that got pushed out. Can you just give us a sense of how you're feeling about your visibility into 2019 relative to, say, a year ago? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Well, I mean, certainly much better than a year ago. And as you've noted, a lot of the long cycle businesses that we anticipated to turn positive have turned positive. And so we certainly feel much better about our visibility into 2019 today than we did even three months ago. But having said that, in terms of guidance specifically for 2019, we think our markets grow. And we don't think that we're at the top of the cycle in many of our businesses. There's certainly a few extraordinary events in 2018 that are pushing markets up, but we think when you look at in terms of a long-term trend, we think many of our businesses, as we talked about in the context of where they are in the cycle, are either at the early point or the middle part of the cycle. And we continue to see growth into 2019. Stephen Edward Volkmann - Jefferies LLC : Okay. Thanks. And then just to go back on Lighting for a second, it's nice to see that sort of stabilizing. But as you mentioned, it still sort of mixes your margin down. And I'm just curious if you've changed the way you think about Lighting as kind of a core business of Eaton going forward and is there any chance to perhaps find another way to kind of deal with that going forward. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yeah, we're focusing on winning in the marketplace. We have made a slight adjustment to our strategy for Lighting in terms of how we think about kind of some of the more commoditized piece of the space, but other than that, no change at all in our strategy with respect to Lighting. We think it's got a lot of great underlying technology. It is very complementary with what we do in the rest of our Electrical business, and so no change in strategic direction. Stephen Edward Volkmann - Jefferies LLC : And do you have a way to improve margins going forward? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yeah. Part of the things that we're doing to improve margins is, as we talked about, where we focus and how we decide to participate or not in some of the more commoditized parts of the business. So there is that element of it. In our Lighting business, no different than the rest of our organization, we have undertaken a number of restructuring initiatives to get at some fixed costs and structural costs, and we'll continue to invest in the high end of Lighting in the area of controls and connected Lighting, and that segment of the market tends to have more attractive margins. Stephen Edward Volkmann - Jefferies LLC : Great. Thank you very much. Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: Our next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc: Hi. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Morning. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hey, for Rick, like to get some more color regarding the working capital dynamics you touched on. Not surprised to see some working capital build with the increased order levels, but maybe some color on the pre-buy on the inventory ahead of the tariff noise and maybe you could size that for us. Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yeah, I think a simple way to think about it, Deane, and maybe to put it into context is that if you looked at our classic working capital at the end of June, namely receivables inventory less payables, and you compared \u2013 that number was about $4.7 billion, and if you compare that to our annualized sales in Q2, our working capital as a percentage of sales was 21.2%. For most of the last couple of years, it's been between 19% to 20%. And the reason it's higher is exactly as you say. The growth in sales, particularly in some of these longer cycle project type businesses, caused receivables to increase. But we also both positioned inventory for the continued sales growth but also took some positions in order to forestall having to pay higher prices. And the kind of numbers you're talking about in inventory increase are in the order of $100 million-ish kind of dollars, and so \u2013 but if you run through the math of 21.2% compared to 19% to 20% on average, you'll see that we definitely have opportunity to bring the working capital levels down as the year progresses. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : That's real helpful. And then as a follow-up, I don't think I've heard data centers get called out so many times in a positive way in quite a while. So just want to circle back on this one. Is there any share gains in the quarter? And then maybe just, if you could, Craig, touch on the approach to servicing the hyperscale customer. They require a completely different set of architecture, hot switchovers and so forth. So what's working well in serving that part of the market? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yeah, and I think to your point, quite frankly 2017 was a little bit of a surprise and a disappointment in terms of what happened in data centers given the underlying demand and the underlying growth in data generation and data consumption. So there's probably a little bit of catchup taking place this year in the market, but the long-term growth trends for data generation, I mean, it's growing at more than a 20% compounded rate a year, and so we think the long-term growth rate in data centers and hyperscale continues to be very, very positive. I'd say that, to your point around a lot of the big hyperscale data center companies, they all have very unique architecture around the way they protect their data centers and the way they configure their data centers, and they will sometimes go through periods where they'll take a pause and they'll rethink the way their data centers are laid out. And so I think you'll find that some of that took place during the course of 2017, and there's perhaps new configurations that are coming out there today. But we're seeing very strong demand across all of the major players and data centers as they really build out their capability for this underlying growth in the market. We do think we're taking some market share, but always difficult to tell for certain exactly where this is going to end up. But we, as a company, are very well positioned in terms of our global footprint, certainly in the UPS space but more importantly in the switchgear space. Our company is very well positioned. We have a very strong reputation with all the data center companies, and we think it's a place where we're going to continue to grow for some time to come. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : That's great color. Thank you. Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: Our next question comes from Mig Dobre with Baird. I guess we'll move on to Andy Casey with Wells Fargo. Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thanks a lot. Excuse me. Question around the implied Q4 organic expectations. I'm backing into a deceleration of somewhere in the 2% to 4% range, but I know this can get thrown off by rounding in Q4 2017 comps. Can you comment on what's included in the current guidance for Q4? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Well \u2013 go ahead. You want to take it? Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc: I was going to say, Andy, if you just look at the full-year guidance we've given and the third quarter guidance, you would see that the rate of growth on higher comps will not be quite as high in Q4. That's our expectation at the present time. Now normally, as you know, you do have sometimes a seasonal impact in Q4. We'll just have to see whether that seasonal impact occurs this year given how strong the underlying markets are. Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. So thank you, Rick. I should just look at that as kind of a placeholder given all the uncertainty? Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yes. Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you very much. Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Good morning. Thank you for squeezing me in. My first question would just be around the backlog. You called it out a lot more in this call and in the slides than prior calls. Classically I guess your backlog is worth less than one quarter's worth of sales. I think it was about $5.2 billion at the end of March against sales in Q2 of $5.5 billion. So I guess within ESS, Hydraulics, and Aerospace specifically where you call out the backlog, give us some idea of how much visibility you have in those three businesses in terms of that backlog, please. Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc: I can take a stab at it. First of all, there are various businesses like Vehicle where we don't have backlogs or at least we don't regard them as stable, so we don't report them. So you need to factor that in. But in general, if you look at our businesses and you look at backlogs over the ensuing 12 months, the backlogs, particularly in project businesses, can be 30% to 40% of the next 12 months. In a case like Aerospace, the backlog will be really high. I can't give you a precise number. And the reason is that the orders are placed well in advance. And so it's a mixed bag. In Vehicle, we typically say we don't have backlogs. We do sort of have a general idea, but we don't have specific back logs. In Aerospace, it's very highly locked in. In larger project businesses it's probably 30% to 40%. And then in Electrical Products, it tends to be much more of a flow type business. So the backlogs are much lower coverage of the next 12 months' revenue. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: And Julian, I'd say the reason we probably put more emphasis on backlog this time than perhaps in prior calls is there's been a lot written and speculated about where we are in the economic cycle, and so we're also looking at this thing just to get a sense for, are we continuing to grow our backlog and build strength into the future, or are things moving in a different direction? And we come away from our own assessment of the backlog and the fact that we're growing backlog in most of our businesses very positive around the outlook for the second half and 2019. Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you for that color. It's very helpful. Maybe following up, Rick, you touched on Vehicle where the concept of a backlog is not particularly useful. So maybe just flesh out a little bit the guidance for Vehicle. You grew low-double digits in the first half. The growth for the year is I think penciled in at about 6% organically. Maybe give us any help on how you're thinking about truck in Brazil and North America versus light vehicle in terms of your second half growth rates. Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc: Well, you can see with the full-year guidance we've given for Vehicle that the growth rate in the back half of the year will be less than in the front half of the year. A lot of that has to do with prior-year comparisons. It also has to deal with some constraints on production that we're seeing in various parts of the market. So as I think Craig mentioned, you saw very strong Class 8 growth in the first half of the year. It won't be as strong in the second half of the year. So those are some of the factors. But all, if you step back and look at the underlying direction of the vehicle markets, we see continued good growth in Class 8 in NAFTA. We see continued strength in the South American markets and broadly the automotive markets have performed a little bit better than we thought this year with growth in Europe and APAC and a little bit of a decline in the U.S. as expected. So we feel pretty good about the underlying tonality of the vehicle market. Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thank you. Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: Our next question comes from Andrew Obin with B of A. Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yeah, thanks for squeezing me in. Just a question on Hydraulics. Our channel checks indicated that on longer lead items I think lead times went up from months to over a year. And I'm just wondering now that your capacity has caught up, how long will it take to sort of adjust things in the channel? And I guess what I'm concerned about, are we going to see multiple quarters of negative orders or significant sort of volatility in growth rates? How long will it take to clear it through the system? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yeah, that's a little bit of a difficult question to speculate on, Andrew. We certainly appreciate why you're asking it. I'd say for the most part, I'd say these changes take place relatively quickly, and as evidenced by what happened in our own business in Europe where a lot of the long lead time orders, the placeholders, if you will, that are put out six months to nine months out where people are just trying to hold a slot, those orders are relatively very quickly adjusted and changed. And so I don't anticipate that it's going to take very much time at all for those adjustments to be made in the ordering pattern, whether it's through our OEMs where you see it more strongly or with distribution. So I think it's a relatively short adjustment. Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got you. And then just a follow-up question on Aerospace. One of the themes at Farnborough I think was somebody described it as this bear hug from Boeing where Boeing is basically going to supply chain, asking for significant price concessions, asking for share of MRO business particularly to participate on NMA or 777X. Can you sort of comment on what you guys are experiencing and how should we think about the profitability of the aerospace business long-term given Boeing's demands? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: I'd say we've learned to dance with the bear, I'd say. We have certainly been involved with both Boeing and Airbus, and the things that they're trying to do strategically. And I'd say that suffice it to say that we have very effective working relationships with both Boeing and Airbus. We understand what their objectives are, and we think that there's plenty of room for win-win solutions with both Boeing and Airbus, finding ways to continue to grow our business and participate more fully in what they do, and also be responsive to what their requirements are. So we don't think that the initiatives that are taking place today inside of Airbus or Boeing, we don't think either one of those two will be problematic for our teams to manage in the course of business. Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : So no structural change of profitability going forward with the new contract structure? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: No, none whatsoever. Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Fantastic. Thanks a lot. Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: Our last question today comes from Mig Dobre. Looks like we had a little problem with the queue earlier, Mig. I'm going to turn it over to you for the last question of the day. Mircea Dobre - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Great. Can you hear me now? Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yeah, perfect. Mircea Dobre - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. Perfect. Perfect. So one last question on Lighting for me. One of your competitors mentioned that this might actually be one area that benefits from 301 tariffs. And I know that obviously you're not at the lower end of the market, but I'm wondering what your perspective is as to how industry dynamics might change here, and is it feasible to think that, broadly speaking, pressure on profitability sort of shifts and you actually get some tailwinds into 2019? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yeah, no, and we certainly have looked at 301 in the context of that same issue and whether or not it should be a net benefit to our Lighting business. At this juncture I would say that it's too early. It's very possible that with tariffs being put on lighting products coming out of China and a lot of the low-end lighting coming from China that there is in fact a bit of tailwind and help for the market and the industry overall. But I would just say the way we think about it today is it's just too early to judge whether it's going to play out that way, and it's not baked into our forecast that way, and if it turns out to be a net positive, it certainly would be a bit of upside for us. Mircea Dobre - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Appreciate it. Thank you. Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: With that, we'll wrap up our call and question-and-answer today. As always, Chip and I will be available for any follow-up questions you might have afterward, and thank you very much for joining us today. Operator : That does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Executive Teleconference. You may now disconnect.",

Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC John Walsh - Credit Suisse Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Eaton Third Quarter Earnings Call. At this time all the participant lines are in a listen-only mode. There will be an opportunity for your questions and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I'll turn the call now to, Mr. Don Bullock, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: Good morning. I'm Don Bullock, Eaton's Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you for joining us for today for Eaton's third quarter 2018 earnings call. As all of you that are on the call have noticed, today our call is occurring at 11 AM versus our traditional 10 start. We moved our call today to allow those of you who follow Cummins to participate in their call, which occurred at 10 AM this morning. With me today are Craig Arnold, our Chairman and CEO; and Rick Fearon, our Vice Chairman and Chief Financial and Planning Officer. Our agenda today as typical includes opening remarks by Craig, highlighting the performance in the third quarter along with our outlook for 2018 and a preliminary look at 2019. As we've done on our past calls, we'll be taking questions at the end of Craig's comments. The press release from the earnings announcement this morning and the presentation we'll go through today have been posted on our website at www.eaton.com. Please note that both the press release and the presentation include reconciliations to non-GAAP measures, and a webcast of this call is going to be available on our website and will be available for replay after the earnings is complete. Before we get started, I want to remind you that our comments today will include statements related to forward-looking future results of the company and are therefore by definition forward-looking statements. The actual results can differ from those forecasted projections due to a range of items covered in the uncertainties covered in our press release, presentation and on the 8-K. And with that, I'll turn it over to Craig. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Okay. Thanks, Don. Hey, let me begin with a quick summary of our Q3 results. And overall it was a solid quarter where our balance across multiple end markets really allowed the company to deliver strong results and so we're really pleased with our Q3 results. Earnings per share of $0.95 on a GAAP basis or $1.43 excluding the impact of the arbitration decision we previously announced in August. This is towards the upper end of our guidance range of $1.35 to $1.45 and up 14% above prior year, excluding naturally the gain from the JV that we formed last year in Q3. Our sales were $5.4 billion, up 4%, and this was comprised of 6% organic growth offset by 1% each from both currency and some small divestitures we had during the course of last year. We're very pleased with our strong margin performance, which included an all-time record margins of 17.6%. Our teams really executed well, which led to all-time record margins in three of our segments including; Electrical Products, Electrical Systems & Services, and Aerospace. And finally, we produced solid operating cash flows of $1 billion in the quarter. On page 4, we compare our performance of the quarter versus prior year and I'll just highlight a couple of items here. Notice that sales were up 4% and strong execution, segment operating margins were up 120 basis points over prior year and we posted 11% increase in segment operating profits. We did have two unusual items impacting the year-over-year comparisons, the gain from the formation of the Eaton Cummins joint venture in Q3 2017 and the expenses from the arbitration decision in Q3 2018. Excluding these items, net income was also up 11%. On page 5, we summarize the quarterly results of our Electrical Products segment. Revenues were flat with organic growth of 1%, offset by 1% currency. And I'll just note here that revenues in the quarter were negatively impacted by the Lighting business. As we discussed in prior calls, in the Lighting business organic revenues declined slightly in the quarter, in line with declines that we've seen in Q2 and excluding Lighting, Electrical Products had 3% organic growth. In the quarter, we saw revenue strength in North America with particular strength and solid growth in the industrial end markets. We had expected our Lighting sales to turn positive in the quarter and we do believe this will happen next quarter. This assumption is also supported by the growth that we saw in our orders during the course of Q3. Overall orders increased 3% for the segment with solid growth in industrial and residential markets in North America. And our backlog is up some 16% over last year. So we're pleased to see the really strong strength and building backlogs during the course of the quarter. Segment operating profits increased 4%, with operating margins up 70 basis points to once again an all-time record of 19.2%. On page 6, we outline the results of our Electrical Systems & Services segment. Organic growth was 9% in the quarter, an acceleration from Q2, which was up 7% and Q1 which was up 2%. Foreign exchange and the divestiture of a small joint venture each reduced revenues by 1% in the quarter. We saw strength in industrial markets and data centers and geographically we saw strength in North America and also in the Asia-Pacific region. Bookings were up 4% with strong growth in EMEA, Asia-Pacific, and with data center orders up double-digit globally. We did see a degree of caution in late September in U.S., especially in large project orders. We've seen this kind of caution in the past on periods of economic uncertainty and so we do think that impacted our orders a bit in the quarter and at the end of the month of September. Notably, our backlog was up 12% versus last year. Operating margins of 15.4% were up 160 basis points and were an all-time record for the segment. On page 7, we cover our Hydraulics segment. Here revenues were up 6%, 7% organic growth offset by 1% from currency. We had strength with multiple OEMs in both construction and ag markets and also in the distribution channel. Orders increased 4% with geographic strength in Asia and in the Americas, and this is on top of very strong comps from Q3 of 2017 which were up some 22% last year. So we saw end market strength in both construction and also in agriculture \u2013 with agriculture OEMs. Geographically, orders were up 12% in the Americas, up 9% in Asia and down 16% in EMEA. Similar to last quarter, orders in EMEA were down due to largely reduced lead times. Our shorter lead times and better delivery performance continues to reduce the need for customers to place long-dated orders in the Europe market. Our Europe orders for deliveries in the three month period, so those shorter lead-time orders, were actually up again this quarter. We continue to have a strong backlog, which was up 24% from last year, operating profits increased 18% and our margins were 14% and 140 basis point improvement over last year. Next on page 8, we summarize Aerospace's performance in the quarter. The Aerospace segment accelerated nicely from 6% organic growth in Q2 to 9% growth in Q3. In the quarter we saw strength across many platforms including military fighters, rotorcraft, regional jet, biz jets, and in both military and commercial aftermarket, so really broad-based strength in our Aerospace business. Orders remained strong in the quarter, up 12%, with particular strength in commercial transport, commercial aftermarket, as well as in military rotorcraft. Our backlog is also up strongly, up some 15% in the quarter. And operating leverage here was really outstanding with profits increasing 25% to an all-time record. Margins of 22% and up some 280 basis points over prior year. In addition to solid execution, I will acknowledge as well that we had favorable mix in the quarter, which positively impacted margins, largely as a result of strength in the commercial aftermarket business which grew faster than the overall segment. Moving to page 9 in the Vehicle segment, in Q3, our organic growth was 7%, and this organic growth was offset by 3% from FX and 2% from the formation of the Eaton Cummins joint venture last year. The NAFTA Class 8 market continues to perform well. We've increased our production forecast for 2018 from 295,000 units to 320,000 units and this is being offset somewhat by weakness in light vehicle markets in China and a bit in Europe as well. Operating profits increased 11% while operating margin stepped up 140 basis points to 18.9%. Overall, another very strong quarter in our Vehicle business. And wrapping up our segment summaries, we move to the eMobility segment on page 10. Organic growth was 7%. As anticipated we're ramping up our R&D investment in this business and therefore segment margins stepped down to 12.5%, which is really in line with our full year margin guidance for the segment. In Q3 we secured an additional contract win for a new eMobility program, which reinforces our optimism for this fast-growing market. And we're also currently in discussions with a large number of additional customers and so our long-term growth outlook for this segment remains quite optimistic. Now moving to page 11. With three quarters behind us and heading into the final quarter of the year, we're fine-tuning our segment expectation for 2018 for both organic revenue growth and for operating margin. Our end markets continue to experience solid growth; we're reaffirming both our full-year organic growth target of 6% and our operating margins of between 16.4% and 17%. While the overall organic growth expectation remains unchanged, we are adjusting our growth estimates for four of the segments. In Electrical Products, we're adjusting it down by a half a basis point (sic) [half a point] (11:01) from 3% to 2.5%, and this is mostly due to softness in Lighting, which we say \u2013 think has extended one quarter longer than what we originally anticipated. But with orders turning positive in Q3, we're really confident that this headwind for the segment has now abated and we expect to see better growth going forward. We're also reducing Hydraulics down 1% from 13% to 12%. We had previously raised our outlook in Q1 from 10% to 13%, reflecting the strength in orders over the last 18 months, so this change from 12% to 13% we think reflects just some fine-tuning with three quarters behind us now. We're also raising our revenue outlook in two segments. We're taking Aerospace up 2%, from 6% to 8% for the year, really on broad-based strength in a number of our end markets, and for Vehicle, we're raising our organic growth forecast by 1%, reflecting the increased production levels in NAFTA Class 8 market in 2018, moving it from 295,000 to 320,000 units. For segment operating margins, we're fine-tuning some of the targets in a number of the segments, but overall, segment margins for Eaton overall remain unchanged. So we think a strong year of conversion. And just turning to page 12, we've taken an opportunity here to summarize our thoughts around our raw material cost and tariffs. As we outlined in Q2, we expect the tariff impact for 2018 to be modest, and as background, it's important to note that we do manufacture in zone of currency, and as a result, we don't have large material flows that would disproportionally be affected by tariffs. Where we are affected we've been focused on taking both price increases and operational actions to ensure that we stay ahead of this issue and our performance today certainly reflects this in the margin strength that we're delivering in our businesses. As we look to 2019, we remain confident in our ability to mitigate the latest round of tariff impacts with both pricing actions and other supply chain changes. As we take a look at the latest round of 301 tariffs that have been now finalized, we expect about $110 million of additional tariff cost in 2019 and we are in the midst of taking actions now that will ensure that the tariff related cost increases are once again fully offset by pricing and other additional supply chain changes. And so we're confident as we look forward just as we look backward that we have plans in place to fully mitigate any tariff related cost increases. And next on the next page, we provide our Q4 guidance, and an updated guidance on the full year. For Q4, we expect EPS of $1.38 to $1.48 and this assumes 6% organic growth, it assumes margins of between 17% and 17.4% and a tax rate of between 12.5% and 13.5%. And as we take a look at the full year for 2018, for the third time this year, we're increasing the midpoint of our full year EPS guidance to a range of $5.30 to $5.40. This naturally excludes the arbitration decision impact. The midpoint of our EPS guidance is increasing 1% from $5.30 to $5.35. We now expect corporate expenses to be $20 million above 2017 levels compared to $10 million that we previously noted and this is largely the result of slightly higher interest expenses. The tax rate for 2018 is now expected to be between 11% and 12%, reflecting really the impact of the arbitration decisions in Q3 that we noted earlier. And consistent with prior guidance, we're expecting operating cash flows of between $2.9 billion and $3.1 billion. This does exclude the $300 million impact from the arbitration decision in Q3, and also unchanged, our free cash flow is expected to be between $2.3 billion and $2.5 billion, once again, excluding the impact of the arbitration decision. Our assumptions for CapEx and restructuring costs are unchanged from prior guidance. However, certainly given the recent pullback in the stock market, we would expect our share repurchases to range from $800 million to $1 billion for the full year and year-to-date our share repurchases have been roughly $600 million. So we'll certainly view this is a buying opportunity given the pullback that we've seen recently. Lastly, at the midpoint of our EPS guidance, we would expect to generate 2018 EPS growth of roughly 15% excluding the impact of the arbitration decision and the 2017 gain from the formation of the Eaton Cummins JV and the income arising from the 2017 tax bill. Hey, just turning to page 14, and I know this is one of the big questions that's on everybody's mind, during last quarter's earnings call we provided a view of our key end markets and really split by three categories, parts of our businesses that we were basically in the early to mid-part of the growth stage, those that were in the middle part of the growth stage and the late stage of growth. And our conclusion then is still our conclusion today, the majority of our businesses are in the early to mid-part of the economic growth cycle. While we do expect the rate of growth to slow somewhat, given the strong 2018 results. We also anticipate that we'll see solid growth in 2019. This view of our end markets is consistent with our initial outlook for 2019 and our assumption that our end markets will grow between 3% and 4% next year. And just turning the page 15, while we provide specific guidance on our Q4 earnings call in January \u2013 we will provide specific guidance on our Q4 earnings call in January, we thought it would be helpful also to share some high-level assumptions around 2019. As I noted, we think our end markets will grow 3% to 4%. At this point in the cycle we'd expect incremental margins on core growth to be between 25% and 30% and this does include any impact associated with tariffs. And our preliminary estimate on corporate costs, including pension, interest and other corporate, suggests that they'll be flat with 2018. We expect our tax rate to be between 14% and 15%, consistent with our expected long-term tax rate, and lastly we continue to see opportunities for attractive returns and restructuring opportunities and we anticipate restructuring spending for 2019 will be generally in line with 2018. So with that, I'll turn the meeting back over to Don Bullock and we're happy to answer any questions that you may have. Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: Before I have the operator provide you with instructions for the Q&A, I did want to note that we do have a number of individuals in the queue for questions today. Given our time constraints of an hour and our desire to get as many of these questions as possible addressed, please limit your questions to a question and a follow-up. Thanks in advance. With that, I'll turn over to the operator to provide you with instructions for the Q&A. Operator : Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: Our first question today comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Good morning. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Craig, I was wondering if you could actually address capital deployment a little bit more directly, and what you're thinking. The spirit I'm asking the question is what seems some plausible speculation you guys were poking around at Esterline. I don't expect you to address that specifically, but maybe you could give us some thoughts on what your appetite is for bigger deals and how you might kind of play that card as we look into 2019? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yeah. Thanks, Jeff, certainly appreciate the question, and as you noted, we don't comment on any potential acquisitions. I would say that our capital deployment strategy is largely unchanged with where we've been. We've said that our first priority in our call on cash is going to be invest in our businesses and to invest in organic growth, and we continue to see really lots of tremendous opportunities to do that. We'll continue to pay a very healthy dividend and buy back shares, and in this environment, as I noted, we'll certainly be much more aggressive in buying back our shares where we think this is a tremendous buying opportunity, and we'll generate a lot of cash over the next several years, and we have the opportunity to deploy that cash in certainly value-creating acquisitions, and there we've said our priorities continue to be in our Electrical business, in our Aerospace business, and also in our new eMobility segment. But having said that, what we've said all along as well, we are not going to lose our pricing discipline, that we have a very structured approach to the way we take a look at deals and those opportunities, and we think our cost of capital is 8% to 9%, and we talk about delivering a minimum of 300 basis points over the cost of capital. And so we intend to remain very disciplined as we take a look at opportunities and how we price them, recognizing that we always have an opportunity to go out and buy our stock back and essentially create tremendous shareholder value. So, we will continue to be disciplined as we have been in the past around the way we think about capital deployment. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Right. And by the same token, any other thoughts about just the portfolio overall? I think that probably is something you are always discussing internally, or thinking about internally. Do you think the structure, combined structure still makes sense for Eaton here? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yeah, I think in simple terms the answer is yes, we like the structure of the company today, we like the makeup of the company today, but having said that, as we've shared with this group in the past, we are always evaluating and assessing. We have laid out a very specific criteria for what's required to be a part of Eaton and the type of characteristics that businesses need to have and the type of results that they need to deliver, and to the extent that we have businesses that are not measuring up to those requirements, there are specific actions in place to improve. And obviously they are on the clock, and they have to improve within a certain period of time. And if they don't improve, we'll do what we've done in the past, and we've always been willing to divest parts of the portfolio that don't live up to the company's expectation. And I can assure you that we have a very thorough process with our board where we review all of our businesses, including nonperforming businesses on a regular basis, and so I would tell you that we will continue to be smart and diligent in assuring that the things that are part of the company pass the criteria or have a path to it, or we'll take other action. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Right. Thank you. Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Nigel Coe - Wolfe Research LLC : Thanks. Good morning. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Good morning, Nigel. Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: Hi. Nigel Coe - Wolfe Research LLC : Yeah, no one told me about the 10 o'clock, I actually dialed in quite early. So just want to dig in a little deeper on the projects pause, I think you called out, specifically within ESS, and I'm just wondering what are you hearing from customers here? Is this more inflation and having to back to the drawing board to reassess project returns? Is it just uncertainty around the macro? Any color there would be helpful. And any end market color in terms of where the project delays are coming from? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yeah, what I see, Nigel, we did see it, as I mentioned, largely in large projects in the month of September, in the Americas primarily, and it was \u2013 certainly caught us by a little bit \u2013 by surprise as well, but I do think it's just simply the environment that we're in right now which is filled with lots of uncertainty, whether it's geopolitical issues, or it's the elections or it's tariffs, quite surprisingly, we were clocking along just fine and were surprised in the month of September, but we do think that it's a temporary pause, and if you take a look at the macro data, whether it's the C30 data or you take a look at some of the key end markets that we serve, there's nothing that would suggest that the fundamentals are not still very much intact. And so we'll have to see what Q4 brings, but at this point, there's nothing that would suggest that the underlying strength that we anticipated to see in our Electrical Systems & Services business would abate at this point. Nigel Coe - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. That's helpful. And then just on China, obviously there's a lot of push and pull going on in China with \u2013 obviously, we're seeing a slowdown in the data, the stimulus measures coming through. Feels like the construction markets are pretty healthy over there. Obviously you play quite strongly into the construction markets, but any comment in terms of what you're seeing in China would be helpful. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yeah, I think, without a doubt we definitely saw a slowdown in China during the course of Q3. Principally, we saw that slowdown in vehicle markets which I think have been largely widely reported and we saw that slowdown as well, although we did deliver solid growth ourself in China in Q3 based upon a number of new wins. And so I do think that as we think about the project business or commercial construction in China, at this point, we think that market continues to be fine. There's nothing that we're seeing in the overall economy that would suggest a significant pullback, although, clearly, there's some uncertainty in the China market as well. I think the tariff impact and the uncertainty that that's creating, I just \u2013 I spent about a week in China myself a couple weeks ago, had an opportunity to meet with a lot of our customers and CEOs of local Chinese companies, and they, too, are feeling this period of uncertainty and I do think there's a little bit of a pause taking place in that market, as well, pending our elections and the ultimate resolution of the trade dispute between the U.S. and China. Nigel Coe - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. Thanks, Rick. Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Hi. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: So maybe just following up on that question on just the large project pause in North America, I guess I'm just trying to understand, did you guys have a sense that these projects were going to be awarded in September and then the customers decided to pause on the decision? Or was this more of like just a gap in the market from the strength that you'd been seeing in the most previous quarters? Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc: Joe, I'll take that one. It really was the former. We had expected contracts to be signed by the end of September and due to the uncertainties that Craig talked about, there are various customers that delayed committing to projects. We think it's temporary. These are projects that are quite far along, so it's not likely that they won't go forward, but it seemed to be that phenomenon, really, just in the last two weeks of September. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: And I'd say that that position is really buttressed a little bit by the fact that if you take a look at our backlog in both our Electrical Systems & Services business, as well as in our Electrical Products business, the both of them were up quite strongly in the quarter, up 12% in Electrical Systems & Services and up 16% in Electrical Products. And so I think that that thesis is really borne out by the increase in our backlog. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. That's helpful. And perhaps my follow-on question, Craig, you mentioned earlier just initial thoughts into 2019 on the contribution margin of 25% to 30%, so that includes the tariff related impact. I'm just wondering, how much are you anticipating to get back of the $110 million in tariffs? And then, also, if you think about just like cadence from a pricing perspective, like how are you guys thinking about that as you progress through 2019? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yeah, I'd say that \u2013 once again, appreciate the question. The 25% to 30% does include the impact of tariffs and while we fully expect to recover all $110 million of the tariff related cost increases, what's obviously problematic is trying to get an incremental on top of a tariff. And so the incrementals that we're talking about for 2019 are somewhat muted as a result of what we think will be an inability to get an incremental margin on a tariff related cost increase, but we certainly expect to fully recover those costs and we expect to be out in front of it and ensure that as we go through the quarter, that the tariff related cost increases are not a headwind to margins. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Understood. Thank you. Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: The next question comes from Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc. Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Hey, good morning, guys. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Hi. Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Hey. So just a couple questions here, truck, big revision here. Is that being driven by the supply chain improving there, any kind of color? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yeah, I'd say, one, Jeff, absolutely. There were some supply chain constraints that we experienced early in the year and there was some concern that we and others had about the industry's ability to actually deliver against the underlying demand that was in the marketplace. And certainly, those constraints have been largely eliminated during the course of the year. And so that's certainly part of what drove us to revise our forecast up, as well as the market has just continued to be very robust. And I'd say the really good news even about some of the order intake that we continue to see in the North America Class 8 market, is that in all likelihood, all of these orders are not going to be delivered during the course of 2018 and they'll spill off into 2019. And so we think 2019 will be another growth year for North America Class 8 on top of a very strong year in 2018. Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. Great. And then data center, I think you cited as been strong, certainly it's been red hot in 2018. If you just look at backlog and quoting activity, what does that suggest for that data center market into 2019? Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yeah, right now we enter, we will enter 2019 with a pretty decent backlog and certainly there are continued discussions for some large orders next year. So we would expect 2019 would be another robust year. Right now it's a little bit hard to say will it be as robust as 2018, 2018 after all did step up dramatically, but it should be another strong year. Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thanks, guys. Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: Our next question comes from Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank. Nicole DeBlase - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah, thanks. Good morning, guys. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Good morning, Nicole. Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc: Hi. Nicole DeBlase - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi. So just I don't want to harp too much on this ESS order issue but just had one more point to clarify. I guess when you think about the customer conversations that you're having and the fact that they're kind of pushing out signing contracts, is there any visibility at all on how long they're pushing out? Like is this oh, we'll delay until 4Q because we want to get this into our CapEx year? Or are these contracts more likely to be signed in 2019 once we get past this next stage of tariffs? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yeah, I think it's really difficult to say precisely, Nicole, how much of a delay we're talking about, but with these projects in general you can't delay them for that long, right? I mean, as they're tied to other underlying requirements for facilities and buildings. And so we don't anticipate that this is going to be a long delay and we would hope to see in the course of this year in the fourth quarter and certainly by time we get to Q1, that this thing rights itself. Nicole DeBlase - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. Thanks, Craig. And then second question just around Hydraulics margins, you guys had to take down guidance again. I guess what's going on there? Maybe a little bit more color and is this just a structurally less profitable business than you thought? Or is this just really attributed to price cost and other issues that are more transitory? And I guess, does Hydraulics have a place in Eaton's portfolio given what we've seen with the margin performance year-to-date? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Sure. First of all, I'd say we too are disappointed in the fact that we've got to take margins down again in Hydraulics, but I'd say the underlying margin issue in Hydraulics is largely a function of supply chain and operational inefficiencies that we're experiencing throughout the system. They're not structural, they're absolutely fixable but we have continued to struggle with the ability to work through supply chain, we're spending a lot more than we anticipated in premium freight and expedite and overtime as the industry has ramped up and our ability, and quite frankly our suppliers' ability to deal with this ramp in orders and sales. And so I'd say structurally speaking, nothing has changed, but having said that, as I've said with all of our businesses, Hydraulics is on the clock. And there are certain things that we have to do to demonstrate that the Hydraulics business can be a consistent performer in the company in terms of underlying margins and underlying growth rate and reduced cyclicality. And so all of the criteria that we've laid out for every part of the company also applies to Hydraulics and they have some work to do to demonstrate that we can create the kind of business that we want to own long term inside of Eaton. Nicole DeBlase - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Understood. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: But structurally speaking, no concerns. And they're operational issues that we have to work out with our supply base. But the business remains largely on target. Nicole DeBlase - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks, Craig. Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: Our next question comes from Steve Winoker with UBS. Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC : Hey, thanks, and good morning. Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc: Hi. Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC : Hey. Just on the 2019 overall market growth of 3% to 4% that you're calling out, are you still thinking about your own outgrowth of that generally and kind of the one and a half times or two times? Or how are you guys thinking about your own performance relative to that? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yeah, I think at this point, Steve, we're still in the midst of doing our own planning internally, but you have the thesis right. The 3% to 4% is market and we would anticipate our businesses growing in excess of market. And so as we get through our own internal profit planning for 2019 and we provide guidance in January, we'll give you a sense for what we think the overall growth rate of the company will be. But it will be something on top of market growth. Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. And I just want to make sure I'm crystal clear on your comments on that delay that you talked about so much on the call. The order delays around ESS, are those projects that are already in the backlog that you saw the risk or just new? And if they are already in the backlog, are you \u2013 can you think about sort of this is 12 to 18-month projects; I assume these are sort of shorter term ones? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: No, I would put \u2013 these are really largely in the category of negotiations that did not result in an order, so, therefore, are not in the backlog. Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. So, therefore, you're not seeing or calling out any incremental risk to what's already in the backlog? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Absolutely not. Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC : All right. Thanks, I'll pass it on. Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: Our next question comes from Mig Dobre with Baird. Mircea Dobre - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Yes. Good morning. I just want to go back if we can, to your 2019 tariff comments. Can you maybe give us a little bit more color on which segments might be impacted more than others? And I'm also wondering if Section 301 essentially gets taken all the way, what would be the incremental impact, if you know it, or you had a to calculate it versus what you've got in the pipe today? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Sure. I'd say \u2013 first of all, I'd say that, to answer maybe to your last question first. Most of the stuff that we do in terms of trade between China and the U.S. has already been captured in the current proposed wave of tariffs. And so if they ended up tariffing 100% of what came out of China into the U.S. it would have an immaterial impact on our company. So most of it's been captured in what's already been announced. And in the context of what's already been announced by segment, I'd say most of it will largely be in our Electrical segments. We had some earlier \u2013 some of the earlier stuff caught our industrial businesses. And this last wave, most of that will be in the Electrical sector. But we will have some smattering of impacts across the other businesses as well. Mircea Dobre - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: I see. That's helpful. And again, looking at 2019 incremental margin comments, 25% to 30%, based on what you just said about tariff impact, is there a way to maybe rank the various segments in terms of where you see opportunity for incremental margins? What's above-average? What would be below average? How do you think about it? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yeah, we certainly appreciate the question, and I'd just say this once again, it's a little bit early for us to provide that level of detailed guidance, as we've not worked through our own internal profit plans. And so perhaps in January we can provide you a bit more insight. But for right now I think if you use 25% to 30% for the overall company, it should help you at least do some preliminary modeling. Mircea Dobre - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: All right. Thanks. Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Joshua Charles Pokrzywinski - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning, guys. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Good morning, Josh. Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc: Hi. Joshua Charles Pokrzywinski - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Just to maybe dig on EP here, I know you guys have talked at length in the past about an implicit attachment rate between EP and ESS. Craig, you mentioned in some of your opening remarks that the industrial side of EP was doing a little bit better. So I would assume that attachment rate is still holding, but when I think about the deceleration in the quarter, Lighting was cited as a bit of an issue. And I would imagine in 2Q that was an issue as well. So I'm just trying to figure out what inside of EP feels different sequentially, understanding that maybe Lighting isn't moving around as much. Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yeah, let me take a stab at it. I would say the fundamentals of the business, let's take Lighting out, that's a separate set of issues. The fundamentals feel not very different than in Q2. The tone of the market, the momentum. What we did see, though, right towards the end of September, is we did see a similar slowing in some of our flow goods in various parts of the business and I would attribute it to the same kind of caution that we saw in ESS, in the orders in ESS. It's just that in a flow good type business, you tend to see it in sales because it just \u2013 it's an immediate impact as opposed to simply an order being placed. Joshua Charles Pokrzywinski - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it. And then just to go back to the outgrowth question that was asked earlier on 2019, could you maybe frame up how you think about the 6% for 2018 and what that represents of outgrowth versus markets just so we can kind of level set how that has trended? Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc: I can take a stab at it. I mean, it's really hard. Joshua Charles Pokrzywinski - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Don't stab too much, it's close to Halloween, Rick. Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yeah, yeah. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Right. Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc: The way I would think about it \u2013 first of all, the way I would think about the general growth in our revenues, 2018 was a year of growth in many of our markets. It was probably above trend and what you're seeing in 2019 is you're coming back towards a more trend-like rate of growth. And our outgrowth in 2018, it's hard to know your markets, particularly in this tumultuous time very exactly, but at 6% organic growth, we're probably a point or so, maybe a little more than a point, of outgrowth. And so if you think about 2019, you could take the 3% to 4% and add something, a point to a point and a half, maybe, roughly, outgrowth and get some kind of rough estimate of what kind of organic revenue growth we're likely to have. It'll be a little less in 2019 than in 2018, but that's to be expected, you come back to a more trend like market growth. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: I think you just answered the question, Rick, that I said I wasn't going to answer. Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc: Sorry about that. Joshua Charles Pokrzywinski - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Appreciate the color. Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: Our next question is from Steve Volkmann with Jefferies. Stephen Edward Volkmann - Jefferies LLC : Hi. Good morning, guys. I was hoping to pile on just a little bit on your thinking around 2019 and when you see overall market growth of 3% to 4%, it feels like half to three-quarters of that's probably available in terms of pricing, which would imply a fairly low growth rate on sort of a unit level. And I'm curious sort of how you think about that. And then the follow-on would be on incremental margin. I guess I would have assumed that 25% to 30% is a good base level, but you would have had some sort of restructuring benefit on top of that. And so, recognizing you probably don't want to put numbers around that, just sort of how do we think about that qualitatively? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Inventories in the market. Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yes. There is a holding number for price in our 2019 market outlook, but it's really preliminary and I wouldn't read too much into that. Does the 3% to 4% need ultimately, to be adjusted for price? Maybe, but it's just too early to have a good feel for that. Stephen Edward Volkmann - Jefferies LLC : And the incremental margin? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: I'd say the way I would think about the incremental margins is that \u2013 keep in mind that a lot of the restructuring stuff that we've done, really, we got a lot of those benefits in 2018 and we'll be spending more \u2013 a similar level of restructuring expenses in 2019. And so I think you saw the pop in incremental margins in 2018, but as you think about just the timing of programs and expense versus benefits, as you take on more and more programs, the profile of cost versus benefit changes. And so I'd say that the 25% to 30% is a good number to use right now and the restructuring programs will have good paybacks, but the \u2013 as you look at every incremental program, the length and the payback pushes out a little bit. Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc: I think it's fair to say we have not yet gone through the detailed restructuring initiatives for next year. So until we do that, we can't be really precise about the benefits next year from those programs. Stephen Edward Volkmann - Jefferies LLC : Fair enough. Thank you. Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: Our next question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yes. Good morning. Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: Hi. Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Just a question on taxes. Given where taxes ended up for this year, why do we think the tax rate will go up next year, particularly as you're working to reduce it longer-term? Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc: Well, there \u2013 2018 is still a transitional year with some changes in the regulations associated with the tax bill. And so we, as we look at those changes including a step-up in the rate of the BEAT tax next year, we believe that the tax rate will naturally move a bit higher. Now 11% to 12% we say is the overall rate, but mind you, that rate's a little lower than it would be because of the Pepsi arbitration. That was a U.S. expense, and of course a U.S. expense pulls with it the U.S. relatively higher tax rate than the rest of the world, and so that pulls the overall rate down. If you look at the rate without that Pepsi expense, the rate is going to be higher by something on the order of a point to a point and a half. And so the difference isn't as great as it seems. Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got you. And then another question. How should we think \u2013 you guys sort of broke out eMobility. And how volatile should we expect this segment to be, both in terms of profitability and top line? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yeah, I'd say that we can expect a fair amount of volatility in this business. Largely, if you think about the top line, is programs and program wins will naturally be lumpy, and they come in very large chunks when you win a program. So I think from a standpoint of the revenue growth \u2013 and once again, the revenue growth we're still saying is going to be out a couple years or so. But it will naturally be lumpy, just by virtue of the type of business and the growth phase that we're in, in this particular industry. And we will continue to invest heavily in R&D. I mean, we talked about the underlying profitability being, order of magnitude 12% as we continue to invest heavily in R&D. As we win programs, each of those will require a level of R&D investment, and so I think you can expect a fair amount of lumpiness in the segment as we move forward. Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Thank you. Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: The next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Morning, Deane. Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc: Hi. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hey. Craig, was hoping you could expand on your comments regarding that you thought most of your businesses were still in the early to mid-stage of the cycle. So what are you basing that on? Are there some bellwether verticals that give you good indications of that as to the size of projects? But some color there for starters, would be helpful. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yeah, I mean, and once again, everybody has their own kind of sense of forecasting, but one of the things we certainly look at in our largest segment, we look at the census data and we looked at consensus forecasts. And when you take a look at consensus forecasts, whether it's Dodge or IHS or Moody's or Associated Builders and Contractors, and we have an economic forecast. And there's also a number of economic forecasters and prognosticators who basically have a view of what 2019 is going to look like. And I'd say, their consensus numbers would suggest that 2019 will look not terribly different from 2018. A little bit of moderation in growth on average or looking at the median, but you're still talking about growth in the 3% to 4% range when you look at this consensus body of forecasters. And when you \u2013 if you talk to customers, you look at negotiations, you take a look at where we are in the economic cycle versus our historical cycles. You put all these factors together. We take a look at an aerospace business that continue to do extremely well on commercial with a big backlog. You look at increased defense spending. You look at the type of orders that we're experiencing today in our North America Class 8 truck business and the type of \u2013 kind of backlog that they'll carry into 2019. So we think it's really only the vehicle markets around the world that have shown clear evidence of sales retrenchment. And most of the other markets that we serve, whether we're looking at the current view or the outlook for our markets would suggest that we continue to see growth. And even for us, if you think about some of the headwinds that we've experienced this year in the context of even Lighting, we don't expect those headwinds to necessarily be there next year. And so once again, we think it's the forecast that we laid out, that our markets will grow 3% to 4% next year, is supported by all the economic data that we take a look at and supported by what we're hearing and seeing from customers as well. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : I appreciate all that color. And then just follow-up on the free cash flow question, was there any sort of prebuying done? We talked about this last quarter, but pre-buying ahead of the tariffs, and maybe also for what you all may have done in terms of inventory building. But anything unique or an impact on the quarter that we would see? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: I would say for sure we did, as I think we talked about a little bit last quarter, we did some pre-buying in terms of inventory to get out in front of the tariffs and protect our customers, and so we did build a little bit of inventory during the course of Q3 that we'd expect to unwind in Q4, and as we go forward. But nothing that I would say is material. Our cash flow numbers in the quarter, $1 billion dollars of free cash flow, and we are maintaining our guidance for the year, and so everything that we've done, we expect to largely unwind it during the course of the year. Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yes, one way to think about it, Deane, is that if you look at simple way of thinking about amounts of working capital. So receivables inventory less payables divided by annualized sales were at about 21.5%, and most of the time we've operated more like 19%. So there is an opportunity to bring that down, it's largely in the inventory area because of some of the need to take positions to deal with the tariff issues. We have not yet done that, but certainly we have plans to take down this inventory back to more normal levels. We hope to make some of that progress in Q4 and some will probably extend into the first quarter of next year. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : That's real helpful. Thank you. Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: The next question comes from Andy Casey with Wells Fargo. Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good morning, everybody. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Hi. Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Wanted to dig into the pause you discussed in some the Electrical markets and look into another vertical, Hydraulics. Did you see any similar pause in that business, specifically in energy and mining? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: I'd say in Hydraulics, no, we really did not see any particular pause in energy and mining and one of the great proxies for what's going on for example in mining, you see the Cat data that's out there, which was, once again, very strong in Q3, and so material prices, the commodity prices are up, that's generally a very good thing for mining overall, very good for the equipment manufacturers. So no, we really did not see any pause in that market at all. China is a big piece of construction equipment and in China in Q3 we continue to see very strong numbers in excavator sales and wheel loaders, and so no, we have not seen a pause in those markets. Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you, Craig. And then separately, Eaton's historically had a really good feel for the NAFTA Class 8 truck market. And we're seeing customers having to wait a real long time for truck deliveries. Are you guys seeing any sign of double ordering within that backlog? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: No, I think at this point we'd say no, we've seen no evidence of that. The market is good right now and obviously rates are up, capacity is up, and we are actually in a replacement cycle based upon trucks that were basically sold, and it peaks eight, nine years ago. And so right now, I'd tell you it all feels good, Andy, and that market as you know, it's subject to be volatile, but everything that we're hearing today from customers and seeing in the market would suggest that no double ordering, and 2019 will be another growth year on top of an extraordinary year in 2018. Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you very much. Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: The next question comes from and Ann Duignan with JPMorgan. Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thank you. Most of my questions have been answered by now. But maybe you could expand on the project win you talked about in eMobility, where is it, what is it, what's the timeline, just some color on that would be great? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Yeah, it was largely, I'd say, Ann, if it was a win in the commercial vehicle segment, and it was a relatively modest win in that particular business. And so I'd say today, not one that's big enough for us to make a lot of noise over at this point, we are still bidding on a number of very interesting opportunities in eMobility, but I'd say that one was largely in commercial vehicles with some of our existing customers, and really not one that I'd say that's worthy of a lot of discussion at this point. Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And then as a follow up, I think when I was with you earlier in the quarter and European construction was showing some signs of weakness, and yet on page 14 it's listed as mid-growth stage. I would think that that's one end market that may be at the later growth stage just given how long that market has expanded. Could you just discuss that a little bit? Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc: We actually, a quarter or two ago would have said it was not yet into even mid, it was sort of late early stage and we think it's moved into the mid stage. But barring political issues in Europe, we think you'll have another year or two of reasonable growth in European construction, Ann. So that's our thinking as to why it's in the mid stage. Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And any regional color, Eastern Europe, Western Europe, Germany versus other regions? I'm just trying to get a sense of where you're seeing the growth. Thank you. Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc: I have to say, Ann, that I can't give you that off the top of my head but certainly Don can follow up with you on that. Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yeah, okay. No problem. And then the only other segment that I think I would disagree with is ag equipment, but we can talk about that offline also given the Chinese tariffs. I'll leave it there for now. Thank you. Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc: Okay. Thanks, Ann. Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: We're probably going to have time for one last question as we want to wrap up on the hour. So we've got John Walsh with Credit Suisse. John Walsh - Credit Suisse : Hi, thank you for fitting me in here. Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: Great. John Walsh - Credit Suisse : So just going back to the initial thoughts on 2019 and as we think about pension and where rates are and I think there's a little bit of a refi benefit potentially in 2019, is there something in corporate to call out? Or is it just it's early days and flat's just the appropriate way to think about it today? Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: I'd say first of all, it is early, and we think it will broadly be flat. But secondly, you do have short interest rates rising and we, like other most large corporates have roughly half of our debt swapped into floating. And so as the short rates rise, our interest costs go up. And so it's really those two factors. As a general matter, it'll be pretty flat, but secondarily, we do know at least of one factor that's likely to increase expenses slightly. John Walsh - Credit Suisse : Okay. And then I guess thinking about data center and what the growth looks like from here is there any discernible mix benefit or headwind to call out as we kind of see the shift to colo and edge over hyper and what that impact is to Eaton? Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc: I'd say not. I'd say that we have a very strong position as a company in hyperscale, and that is the fast-growing segment of the market. And so I think if anything, the advantage goes to Eaton as you look at these larger, more complex hyperscale data centers. John Walsh - Credit Suisse : Okay. Thank you. Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc: With that, we'll wrap up the call for the day. I do want to remember that we will be available for follow up for the remainder of the day and in the days and weeks following this. Thank you all for joining us on the call today.

For the conference, all the participant lines are in a listen-only mode. There will be an opportunity for your questions and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions]. I\u2019ll turn the call now to Mr. Donald Bullock, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Donald Bullock : Good morning. For those of you I\u2019m Donald Bullock, Eaton's Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you to all of you for joining us for Eaton's fourth quarter 2018 earnings call. With me today are Craig Arnold, our Chairman and CEO and Rick Fearon, our Vice Chairman Chief Financial and planning officer. The agenda for today\u2019s call includes our opening remarks by Craig, highlighting the performance in the fourth quarter, our outlook and our guidance for 2019. As we\u2019ve done on our prior calls, we\u2019ll be taking questions at the end of Craig\u2019s comments today. Before we dive into that, I do want to make couple of quick passing comments. The press release for our earnings announcement this morning and the presentation we\u2019ll go through today have been posted on our website at www.eaton.com. Please note that the press release and the presentation include reconciliations to non-GAAP measures, and a webcast of this call will be accessible on our website and available for replay after today\u2019s call. Before we get started, I do need to remind you that the comments today do include statements related to expected future results of the company and are therefore forward-looking statements. Any results may differ materially from a forecast that could be due to a wide range of risk and uncertainties, and those are described in the earnings release and the presentation, and they will be also outlined in our related 10 Q filing. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Craig. Craig Arnold : Okay. Hey thanks, Don. I\u2019ll start on page 3 with highlights of our Q4 results, and I\u2019ll start by saying that I\u2019m very pleased naturally with their report this morning and another very strong quarter performance, which really rounded out our solid year overall. Earnings per share of a $1.46 a share, up 13% from last year, and above the midpoint of our guidance. And this was driven by flows strong growth in sales, as well as higher margins. Sales are actually $5.5 billion in the quarter, an increase of 5% and this includes 7% organic growth and this was above our guidance of 6% for the quarter. Bookings growth in the quarter was also strong, led by double digit growth in both Electrical Systems & Services and in Aerospace. And so we continue to be pleased with our margin performance as well, which increased 100 basis points to 17.4%. We had solid margin performance really across all of the segments and all time record margins in Electrical Systems & Services and in Aerospace. We also generated very strong operating cash flows at $1.1 billion, up 27% and a quarterly record if you exclude the $300 million arbitration payment that we made earlier this year. And lastly, we reported and repurchased $700 million of shares in the quarter, taking advantage of what we saw this frequent pullback in financial markets. And if you\u2019ll recall, we had planned to purchase $240 million in the quarter to achieve our target of $800 million to $1 billion for the year. I\u2019d say for now, you can think about this as an acceleration of purchases and that we were planning to make in 2019. However, if markets remain weak, we\u2019ll certainly take advantage of those opportunities as well and buy at higher levels. Moving to Page 4, you\u2019ll see our financial summary for the quarter. You can read these numbers for sure, but I\u2019ll provide maybe just a bit of context here. First, our operating segment profits increased 11% and we generated strong incremental of almost 40%. Second, segment margins of 17.4% were at the high end of our guidance range, and 100 basis points above Q4, 2017. And finally, our net income as reported was flat with prior year and prior year included income related to the U.S. tax bill, excluding this onetime benefit from Q3 -- Q4, 2017 our net income increased 10%. On page five, we\u2019ll start our segment overviews with electrical products. The revenues grew 3% in Q4 and this includes 5% of organic growth offset by 2% in currency. And this was really a strong finish to the year and in the end it was actually our highest organic growth rate for Electrical Products since Q4 of 2014. As we expected, growth in our lighting business turned positive and was up mid-single digits, while orders increased 3% and this was led by solid growth in the Americas. I\u2019d also note here that our backlog increased 15% and while we generally think about this as a book-and-bill business, this increase does suggest that we didn\u2019t see any unusual pre-buying at the end of the quarter. Segment margins were 18.2% flat with prior year and this was largely a result of some unfavorable product mix between the businesses. Next, we can move to Page Six and a summary of our Electrical Systems & Services Segment. As I noted in my opening commentary, this segment posted excellent results for the quarter. The business continued to strengthen. We posted 10% organic growth in the quarter in with strength across all major end markets. The 10% growth represented an acceleration of growth, which was above our Q3 growth rate of 9% and above the Q2 growth rate which was up 7%. And as you can see we did have some negative impact from foreign exchange and a small divestiture during the course of last year. Orders were even stronger up 12% on strong growth and all major end markets in the Americas, and in EMEA. And I\u2019d say that there\u2019s strong growth in Q4 was against a very strong comp from last year where orders were up 12%. You\u2019ll recall from our Q3 earnings call that we noted a pause in orders during the month of September. We had expected that this was largely project timing and temporary. So things really played out as we expected in this segment. In addition, our backlog continued to increase and was up 13%. So overall, the segment is performing very consistent with what we would expect from this long cycle business. And lastly, segment operating profits were up 19% and we generated all time record margins in this segment of 16.6%, so a very strong quarter across the board. If you turn to page seven, we'll summarize the results of our Hydraulics business. Here, we had another strong quarter of revenue growth with sales up 6%, 8% organic growth offset by 2% negative currency. And we continued to see strength really in mobile and with Industrial OEMs, and Construction and Ag markets and in the distribution channel, so pretty broad based. Orders were down 4%, and I would say here on tough comps and if you recall Q4 2017, our orders were up 25%. In the quarter, we did however see continued strength in Asia with orders up 10%, orders in the Americas were flat, but at very high levels. And we continue to see order weakness in EMEA with orders down some 24% as lead times continue to improve. And I\u2019d also add here, but this was the region where we had our most difficult comp, orders in Q4 of 2017 were actually up 38%. And so we feel once again pretty good overall about the activity levels in the hydraulics business. Our backlog does remain strong; it increased 6% from last year. And turning to operating profits, we increased profit by 15% and our operating margins increased 90 basis points to 13%. So I think the right conclusion here is that we made solid progress in this business, which was held back in some prior quarters by some supply chain issues, but that progress needs to continue and is expected to continue going into 2019. On Page eight, we moved to Aerospace, and the business here is clearly firing on all cylinders. Now begin by noting that growth continues to accelerate in Q4 with organic revenue growth up 13% and this is up from 9% growth in Q3 and 6% growth in Q2. Orders also accelerated, they are increasing 17% with strength in commercial transport military fighters and both commercial and military aftermarket. And our backlog continues to grow up some 13% in the quarter. Now the business here also demonstrated very strong operating leverage with profits increasing 30% and delivering record operating margins of 22.9%. I would add that favorable mix certainly contributed to these record margins as aftermarket revenues continue to perform well, but our team also is doing an outstanding job of executing. Moving to the Vehicle Segment on page 9, we\u2019re also very pleased with how this segment performed in the quarter. Our revenues were down 2% with flat organic revenues, and 2% percent negative FX. The NAFTA Class 8 truck market remained very strong in the quarter and reached 324,000 units for 2018 and this is up some 27%. You\u2019ll recall here that revenues for our automated truck transmission business are now included in the Eaton Cummins joint venture and are not consolidated in our financials. The JV actually had revenue growth up 45% in the quarter. So our business overall is performing extremely well. On the other hand, our global light vehicle production was down in Q4, with North America up modestly offset by slight declines in Europe, and particular weakness as you\u2019ve all heard in China. Despite flat organic revenues, operating profits increased 4% and our operating margins increased 90 basis points to 17.9%. And finishing up our segment summaries, eMobility is on page 10. Organic revenue growth was 11% offset by 1% negative currency. Not unexpected, operating margins declined to 11.3% as we continue to ramp up our R&D spending. You\u2019ll recall that this new segment was created in Q1 of last year. At last year\u2019s investors meeting, we told you that eMobility would become a new $2 to $4 billion offset of our company. And I\u2019m pleased to say that we\u2019re on track. 2018 was a busy year and a year where we ended ahead of schedule. We\u2019re in ongoing discussions with a large number of customers on new programs, and we remain very optimistic about the long term growth outlook for the business overall. We\u2019re ahead of schedule on new product developments. These new products are allowing us to quote on a broader range of opportunities and quite frankly to move from selling only components to selling systems. So we remain very excited about the future of this segment, and the work that our team is doing and what this represents as a growth opportunity for Eaton as we move forward. And before we turn our attention to 2019, I would like to just take a moment to recap some of the key highlights from 2018 now which we see a strong year as a strong year of progress. First, end markets improved allowing us to generate 6% organic revenue growth and this was double the growth rate of 2017 and above our initial estimate for the year, which was 4%. We continued to make good progress on enhancing our margin performance with a 100 basis point improvement and setting an all-time record for the company at 16.8%. As a result, our net income per share of $5.39 when you exclude the $0.48 [ph] impact in the legacy Cooper arbitration decision was up 16% over 2017. And our teams very effectively offset both the impact of tariffs and commodity inflation with incremental price. We generated $3 billion of operating cash flow and this would exclude the $300 million impact from the arbitration payment. This allowed us to return $2.45 billion to shareholders. $1.15 billion in dividends and another 1.3 billion of share repurchases and the 1.3 billion represents 4% of our shares outstanding at the beginning of the year. So, overall very proud of the team. We exceeded our financial commitment to shareholders. We invested in the future of the business and really are building a stronger company. Now turning to 2019. Let me begin by summarizing our growth outlook. Overall, we\u2019re expecting 4% to 5% organic growth, and this is consistent with the outlook that we provided in Q3, 2018 during our conference call. As we take a look at our individual businesses, we expect 4% to 5% organic growth in Electrical products, with continued strength in industrial and large commercial projects. We expect modest growth in lighting, and also modest growth in single phase power quality and small commercial projects. For Electrical Systems & Services, we see 5% to 6% organic growth. And here our backlog is very strong. We expect continued market strength and power distribution assemblies in the Americas and in the datacenter markets globally. We also see modest growth, in both the utility and harsh and hazardous markets. For hydraulics, growth is expected to be 5% to 6% on revenue levels that are already very strong, but we see continued strength in mobile markets in Asia and in North America. And Aerospace markets really are universally strong, and we expect to see 8% to 9% growth on strength in OEM and aftermarket, and really, with both military and commercial customers. Vehicle markets are expected to be flat for both North America heavy duty truck, and global light vehicles. But, both are running at I\u2019d say very high levels, and we expect to see strong growth in the Brazilian truck market. Overall, our organic revenues are expected to be down 2% to 1% for the year, but once again keep in mind, that our revenues for automated truck transmissions are expected to grow and are now apart and reported as a part of the Eaton Cummins joint venture. Finally, we expect eMobility to grow 11% to 12% organically, consistent with a level of growth that we experienced in 2018. And while we\u2019re still a few years away from what we call a major growth inflection point, our optimism for this segment continues to grow as we look forward. Moving on to Page 13, we lay out our margin expectations for 2019. For Eaton overall, we expect segment margins to be between 17% and 17.4%. At the midpoint, this represents a 40 basis point improvement over 2018 and it really places us solidly within the 17% to 18% range that we set as a 2020 goal. And I would add, one year ahead of schedule. And with the exception of new eMobility, we investing \u2013 we were investing heavily in product development. Margins are expected to increase in each of our segments, specifically Electrical Products at 18.6% to 19.2%, to a 50 basis point improvement and Electrical System & Services at 15.2% to 15 8%, up 60 basis points. Hydraulics at 14% to 14.6% up 90 basis points. Aerospace at a very strong level already, but at 21.4% to 22% up 70 basis points and Vehicle at 17.4% to 18% up 20 basis points. eMobility as we noted, we\u2019re investing heavily in this segment. Margins will be down to 6.1% to 6.7% from 70 basis points, really just as a function of heavy R&D investment. And on page 14, we pick up the balance of our guidance for 2019. So we expect our full year EPS to be $5.70 to $6 a share. At the midpoint, this represents a 9% increase, excluding the impact of the arbitration decision that reduced 2018 earnings by some $0.48. As we discussed, organic revenue is expected to be up 4% to 5%, but this growth is expected to be partially offset by some $250 million of negative currency translation. We expect our corporate costs, including pension and interest and other corporate items to be flat with 2018 and our tax rate to be between 14% and 16%. This will result in operating cash flows coming in between $3.1 billion and $3.3 billion and we expect CapEx to be $600 million. As I noted, we accelerated some $400 million of share repurchases into Q4. So the target purchases for 2019 are now at $400 million. And for Q1, we expect EPS to be between $1.18 and $1.28, a 12% increase at the midpoint. And for Q1, we also expect organic growth to be approximately 4% to have segment margins between 55 and 59 and a tax rate of between 13% and 14%. So overall, we expect another strong year. And this concludes my opening comments, and I\u2019ll hand it back to you and you can open the line for Q&A. Donald Bullock : Thanks, Craig. Before we go ahead to operator to open it up for questions, I do want to make a couple of comments. First, we do acknowledge today, is a day that has an enormous number of peers out there and earnings announcements. So we are going to hold our call to an hour. To do that, it\u2019s important that you limit your questions to a question and a follow up if you would, so we can be sure to cover everyone\u2019s questions. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over the operator to give instructions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Donald Bullock : Our first question today comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Jeff Sprague : Thank you. Good morning. Thought very solid Craig, I was wondering, if you could provide a little bit of additional color on how you saw things play out during the quarter, obviously the quarter itself was very strong. But we did have that peculiar slowdown in September. Did you see people tapping the brakes in December as the market got wobbly and what are you seeing here in January? Craig Arnold : Jeff, I guess you\u2019re referencing largely what we talked about on the Q3 earnings call and Electrical Systems & Service where we did see this pause during the month of September. We\u2019d indicated at the time that we thought that was a temporary pause, that these products do at sometimes tend to be lumpy, and we thought that, that would come back in Q4, which it certainly did. No, I\u2019d say Q4 was really pretty much a consistent quarter. We saw the high level of economic activity really across the quarter, pretty consistent across each of our businesses and as I\u2019d noted, with no real significant, no measurable pre buy at all, as evidenced by the growth in our backlog. And so, I think it was a solid clean quarter across the board, and despite the level of economic uncertainty that\u2019s out there. Activity levels are fairly good, and in through the month of January, we\u2019ve really seen kind of a continuation of that performance. Certainly, in the context of our guidance for Q1, which is a little lighter than the growth rate that we saw in Q4, we do think there is some economic uncertainty out there, which is essentially what we have reflected in our guidance. But by and large, activity levels across our businesses are still quite positive and quite strong. Jeff Sprague : Thanks and unrelated. Just on tax, Rick. I mean your guidance is pretty straightforward, but we\u2019ve seen a couple of companies getting hit by this IRS change and deductibility of interest. Is that an issue for you or a wild card or is that fully encapsulated in your guide? Richard Fearon : It\u2019s fully baked into our guide. One of the reasons that the tax rate jumps from roughly around 13% to 15% in 2019 is because we\u2019re reflecting the implications of all these regulations that came out last year, some of which, I think surprise some companies. But we had anticipated that they would come out largely as they did. So that\u2019s why we\u2019re comfortable with this 14% to 16% range for 2019. Jeff Sprague : Great. Thank you. Donald Bullock : Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Joe Ritchie : Thanks. Good morning guys. So Craig, maybe just on the EPS range. $0.30 wide versus kind of like typical is closer to $0.20. Maybe, can you just give us some insight into why you expanded the range, and what market conditions have to be in place to drive you to that towards the higher end or the lower end of the range? Craig Arnold : Yes, I would suggest Joe that don\u2019t really over read or read much into the fact that the range is a little bit wider. I mean, I think it\u2019s as our EPS in absolute dollar terms increases the percentage and the range will naturally widen a little bit. But I\u2019d say that, for us, the big variables as we look forward into 2019 that could potentially influence whether you\u2019re on the low end or the high end of the range. It\u2019s largely a function of what happens with our end markets. Right now, I said we\u2019re feeling fairly good. It was a strong fourth quarter, coming in stronger than what most had expected ourselves included. And so I think, it\u2019s really a function of how end markets perform going into 2019, and to what extent some of the geopolitical kind of concerns that the world we\u2019re dealing with in various kind of countries around the world get resolved. But I wouldn\u2019t read anything into the fact that the range has been opened up a little bit. We\u2019re feeling very good about kind of you know the company\u2019s performance overall and degrees of freedom that we have around things that we can do in the event of a little bit of an economic slowdown. So I would not over read that at all. Joe Ritchie : Craig that said, that\u2019s good to hear. And I guess my follow on, you guys cited power distribution assemblies and data centers as strong growers in 2019. I think data centers are up high single digits. This is though a little at odds with some of the announcements we\u2019ve heard from some of the chip makers, so maybe talk a little bit about like the strength that you\u2019re seeing in data centers that makes you feel good about the prospects for 2019. Craig Arnold : Yes. I mean the data center market I\u2019d say if you look at the long term trend of what we\u2019ve been seeing in general, the whole world generates and consumes more and more data. I think it\u2019s pretty compelling for the long term growth prospects. We saw strong double digit growth in 2018 and as well as a lot of major projects being announced. And so, as we think about data centers in general, while on the hyperscale side of the market, it can be somewhat lumpy. We do think that what we\u2019re looking at in the form of an existing backlog and projects, that were in the pipeline, that the numbers that we\u2019re talking about for 2019, which is kind of mid-single digit growth are very much in line with what we have visibility to. I think the chip maker piece is perhaps one that\u2019s a little bit more nuanced in terms of whether or not that\u2019s a direct proxy for what we\u2019re seeing specifically in the data center market, as a lot of the big data center companies are actually in many cases vertically integrating and doing a lot of this work themselves as opposed to relying upon third parties. But now we feel very good about the data center market and about how we\u2019re positioned and about the number of projects that have already been announced. And so we think it\u2019s going to be another strong year. Joe Ritchie : Okay. Great, thanks Craig. Donald Bullock : Our next question comes from Nicole DeBlase at Deutsche Bank. Nicole DeBlase : Morning guys. Craig Arnold : Morning, Nicole. Nicole DeBlase : So I guess maybe starting with the 1Q outlook, it seems to me like the step down to 4% organic growth could be a little bit of conservatism reading between the lines of what you said in response to Joe\u2019s question. But I guess, maybe thinking about from a segment by segment perspective, where the step down is coming from? Craig Arnold : Yes, I\u2019d say that as we take a look at Q1, we\u2019re certainly seeing a step down in the growth rate. I\u2019d say principally and Electrical Systems & Services is one of the big drivers and hydraulics, I\u2019d say would be another one and then also in Aerospace. So those would be the three big ones that I\u2019d say that\u2019s a relative step down in the growth rate. And I think, largely the way we think about it in the call is the way I answer the question earlier is that, there is a lot of economic uncertainty out there whether it\u2019s Brexit or the funding of the U.S. government or trade disputes with China. And so, we think given the level of uncertainty that\u2019s still out there in Q1 that you could largely see a little bit of a pause in economic activity until some of these major structural issues are resolved there. And that\u2019s kind of what\u2019s baked into our forecast. Could it be conservative, it could be, but given kind of just a level of economic uncertainty out there, we think it\u2019s prudent to plan for these issues to at least extend through Q1 and be resolved at some point and we think all of that logic is baked into our guidance for the year of growing some 4% to 5%. Nicole DeBlase : Okay understood. Thanks Craig. And I guess, maybe my second one just around hydraulics. So one of your big distributors talked about solar power demand stepping down a bit in the last two weeks of December. Curious about that, as well as a confidence in the outlook for China Mobile to remain strong just because I think Cat is looking for more like kind of a flattish equipment environment in China in 2019? Craig Arnold : Yes, I know China has continued to -- maybe I\u2019ll deal with that one first before I get to the distributor one. China has continued to perform extremely well. If you take a look at excavator sales in Q4, and [Indiscernible] sales excavator, sales are up more than 20% in Q4. Vehicle [ph] order sales up more than 10%. And so the China construction equipment market at least in terms of looking at the public data continues to perform extremely well and our business does as well. And so, we think as we look into 2019, we do think that growth rates are moderate, but we still think that we see growth in the China mobile market specifically going into 2019 and that\u2019s kind of consistent with what we\u2019re hearing from many of our customers. And quite frankly, Eaton in the region we\u2019ve done extremely well in terms of new wins and gaining some market share on platforms and that also influences our thinking as well. But in terms of the distribution market, I can\u2019t really speak to one distributor in one part of region. I would say that, our hydraulics business in Q4, we had growth of organic growth of 8% and that growth was pretty even throughout the quarter. And so, we felt very good about the growth rates and we did not see generally speaking, or here generally speaking of any slowdown that took place at the end of the year. It wouldn\u2019t surprise me that there is a distributor someplace who saw a slowdown someplace. But more broadly speaking, our business continued to perform well. Nicole DeBlase : Understood. Thanks Craig. Donald Bullock : Our next question comes from Ann Duignan with JPMorgan. Ann Duignan : Yes. Hi good morning. Maybe Craig, maybe you could dig a little bit deeper into some of your end markets and give us some color in terms of where you\u2019re seeing the strength and looking particularly maybe Electrical Products, which specific industrial markets, which some segment of commercial projects and then likewise maybe power distribution. Just so we get some color as to what\u2019s going on out there. Craig Arnold : Yes and I\u2019d say that in the beginning with Electrical Products. One of the things we noted was lighting business returned to natural growth. It\u2019s been a business that obviously we were taking some strategic steps to work through some specific market segment issues, and so that business for us returned to growth in Q4. And we think the outlook for lighting going into 2019, is that business will continue to grow low to mid-single digits. We think that the single phase power quality business, another business that grew mid-single digits in Q4. We had order growth that was a little better than that actually in Q4. And so that market continues to do well, and then largely the power distribution components, a lot of what we sell in the component side goes into small and large commercial projects in general. And so when you think about some of the growth that we see today in our Electrical Systems & Services businesses, mainly most of the components that support that business come through our Electrical Products business, and some of that goes to distribution is aftermarket as well. And so that business continues to do well. So we saw generally speaking, pretty decent growth as I mentioned the strongest growth that we\u2019ve seen since 2014 in Electrical Products and the orders are performing solidly. And so, we think that market continues to have a decent year in 2019. In Electrical Systems & Services and it\u2019s really as I mentioned almost strength across the board. Large industrial projects, commercial projects, those markets continue to perform extremely well, and you see many of the same data streams that we see, non-res construction numbers continue to be up strongly mid-to-high single digits. The Dodge non-res contracts on -- were up 23% in dollars in Q4, and on a square footage basis up 10%. And so we\u2019re really seeing strength in most of the non-res construction markets and as we talked about in data centers hyper scale and data centers in general had very strong results, up strong double digits in 2018 and we think a little bit of moderation in that growth rate as we move into 2019, but still strong growth. And so we think in general, these businesses continue to perform very well and that no real evidence of any economic slowdown at this point. And so we\u2019re feeling very good about 2019. And then [Indiscernible] what your own guess is another one of those segments that\u2019s been a lot of stuff talked about, but we had very good growth in Q4 and our [Indiscernible] business up, strong, single digits, high single digits. And so that business as well despite a little bit of pullback in oil and gas prices at the end of the year, we saw some recovery in December. And so we think that market also continues to grow going into 2019. Ann Duignan : Okay, that\u2019s good color. I appreciate that. And then just to follow up on that sustainability of aerospace margins. I mean we know it\u2019s great that high margins in aerospace, but we also know we have to be investing in the future, so can you just talk Craig maybe about the near-term maybe positive mix versus the longer term. You need to be on the next platform in order to sustain those high margins? Craig Arnold : Absolutely, and appreciate the question. I think there\u2019s two things that are really driving the high margins in aerospace. I think one, it is the fact that aftermarket is continuing to perform extremely well. In better than most I mean at the end of the day, you make most of your money in aerospace and aftermarket, and an aftermarket is performing extremely well both in commercial and in on the military side. The other thing that I\u2019d say that we and others are getting a real benefit from right now is really what you alluded to and it\u2019s the fact that we\u2019re in a bit of a pause period as an industry in terms of new programs. We went through a massive refresh over the last 10 years, and most of these new programs are actually going into service at this point in time, and the next, by the time you get to the next generation, the next refresh you\u2019re probably 5 years to 10 years out. And so I do think that our aerospace margins will continue to be at very high levels for the next number of years and until we get to the point where we have the next round of major investments required for the next generation of commercial and/or military aircraft. And so, we are investing in the future. We\u2019re doing a lot of investments in offline technology development to be ready, for insertion to get to a technology readiness level that says that we\u2019re ready to participate on the new platforms. But I say it\u2019s really those two things that are really benefiting our business as well as very strong execution by our operational teams. Ann Duignan : Right. Thank you. I leave it there. I appreciate there. Donald Bullock : Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Nigel Coe : Thanks guys. Good morning. Craig Arnold : Hi. Nigel Coe : So, what a difference [Indiscernible]. I\u2019m just trying to understand the turnaround in ESS because it feels like there\u2019s probably economic concerns in the U.S. than there was back in September, October. So I'm wondering what are you hearing from fields, your sales, engineers, customers whatever in terms of what cause the pause and why there risk now? And maybe just in terms commenting on creep activity this quarter pull ahead a price increases as such. Did you see any of that? And could that explain some of this pressure? Craig Arnold : I\u2019d say \u2013 Nigel, I appreciate the question. We spend the fair amount of time talking about Q3 earnings call. And I think the way we characterize it at the time was we said the business we thought was in fine shape, at least that we saw a specific pause in the month of September and the business tends to be lumpy anyway and we try to encourage everyone to the look through September and say everything will be fine, which is to way it turned out. And so, I wish I could give you the exact answer to why we saw this pause in the month of September other than saying at sometimes it does happen in these big systems businesses where orders tend to be lumpy. But by and large I think what we characterize in Q3 what that our Electrical System & Services business was doing great. It was in fine shape. And we expected that we would continue to post strong growth in that long cycle business and that's essentially what\u2019s happened. Now and to the point around pull ahead, we\u2019re not really seeing any pull aheads at all. We talked about. As we continue to build backlog in that business. It\u2019s up some 13% from last year. And so I that would, the way I characterize Electrical Systems & Services is once again very much like long cycle business. Its performing as expected and you will occasionally find a month or so where things tend to be lumpy. Nigel Coe : Okay. That\u2019s great color. Thanks Craig. And then just maybe address price and in particular lighting price. I feel that lighting price is getting a lot better. And so I just appreciate your comment in what you're seeing in term of demand for lighting, obviously low single-digit since 2019, but specifically the price component of that what you\u2019re seeing in the market? Craig Arnold : Yes. I would say that lighting prices in general and some of this could be as a function of trade and other things that are perhaps putting a little bit of a floor underneath some of the pressure that have been coming historically from the Chinese import, but yes, I would say that it did has the pressures in around lighting have somewhat abated. It still remains a very competitive industry and historically speaking if you recall in this business a lot of the lighting price get back was really a function of the fact that the price of semiconductors and electronics in general continued to fall and those prices were essentially passed on to our customers and to the consumers in the form of lower prices of LEDs. And so some of that is also that the price of the core electronic component is not falling at the rate that it has historically and we reached a little bit about bottom on some of that. And I think that also influencing the fact that lighting prices are foaming somewhat. We did have a much better Q4 with the mid-single digit growth. Our outlook going forward is low to mid single-digit and so we do think that the lighting business performs better for sure going into 2019 even it becomes no longer a headwind for the business becomes a little bit of a tailwind with respect to growth and so we\u2019re enthuse by that. Nigel Coe : Okay. I\u2019ll leave it that. Thanks Craig. Donald Bullock : Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Julian Mitchell : Hi. Good morning. Craig Arnold : Good morning, Julian. Julian Mitchell : Good morning. Maybe just the first question around the hydraulics business in the margin profile, as you said you had some operating inefficiencies in 2017 and 2018. If you could quantify at all what kind of margin headwind they comprised in 2018? And how quickly you catch up from those in 2019 and may be any other respects in which it changing how you sort of manage the productivity and the manufacturing pull-through in that business? Craig Arnold : Yes. I appreciate the question, Julian, because this is obviously been one of the segment that we spend quite a bit of time talking about during the course of our earnings calls and one of the segments were we did in fact reduce our guidance for the year. And the way we characterize and then, I think it's the largely the case Julian, is that, this industry went through a very significant ramp of V-shaped [ph] recovery the supply chain and our supplier to many cases were just not ready for the ramp. And so we had a lot of inefficiencies in the business as a function of having to expedite parts. We had some challenges in ramping up hiring, not only in our facilities, but our suppliers had the same issues. And so there was just a whole host of inefficiencies associated with an industry that went through a V shape recovery and we were all caught a little bit flat footed. And as a result of that, those inefficiencies I\u2019d say, if you think about the reduction in our margin guidance for hydraulics during the course of the year, you can largely say that is about equivalent to the level of inefficiencies that we saw in the business. And as one of the reasons why we as we look at the guidance for 2019, we think most of those efficiencies come out of this system and we would get to a business once again that\u2019s performing more like what we would expect. And so I\u2019d say that, while we\u2019re not 100% out of the woods, most of the issues that we dealt with doing a course of 2018 and the efficiencies therein are largely behind us now. Julian Mitchell : Thank you. And then my second question. I think a lot of the Q&A so far has been on demand dynamics, so maybe switch to talking about capital deployment a little bit. You did some accelerated share buyback spend in Q4 when the price was down and obviously you\u2019ve seen a good rebound since so the timing looks very good on that. Maybe flesh out a little bit how you are thinking about buybacks versus M&A and what kind of M&A appetite you have looking out this year? Craig Arnold : Yes. Appreciate the question. No we did like, you articulate we saw the overdone Q4 pullback as a real buying opportunity and we did take that opportunity to accelerate some planned purchases into the end of the year. And I\u2019d say, if you think about a capital deployment strategy, I think we\u2019ve laid that out historically and we talked about, as we think about capital deployment. The first call on cash will always be reinvesting in each of our businesses, and making sure that every one of our businesses has the capital that they need to be successful and the win in the marketplace. With respect to M&A versus share buyback, we have been out of the M&A market for the last several years. We do -- I would say that the environment today is such that we\u2019re looking at perhaps more opportunities and more deals in than ever. Pricing continues in some cases to still be a challenge and we've agreed that we\u2019re going to maintain our pricing discipline through this period of perhaps pricing being above what we think is reasonable. We\u2019ve said that our cost of capital is anywhere from 8% to 9%. We want a minimum of 300 basis points over our cost of capital. And so we\u2019re going to be disciplined through this period. But having said that, we would like to get back into the M&A market, and the way I would think about it is our priority will be largely around bolt on acquisitions where you get a lot of leverage within our existing businesses, and therefore we can deliver synergies and value in these acquisitions that we acquire. But having said that, in the event that we\u2019re not able to put capital to work through M&A, we will generate as I mentioned a lot of free cash flow in 2019. We won\u2019t let capital build up on the balance sheet. And so we\u2019ll certainly in the event that we\u2019re not successful in the M&A market, we\u2019ll certainly be more aggressive in buying back our shares. Richard Fearon : And Julian, if I might add. We brought our debt levels actually even a little bit lower than we had originally anticipated after Cooper. And if you just do a quick little math of our midpoint of 3.2 operating cash flow on takeout CapEx, takeout of about 600 million, takeout dividends, take out the 400 million repurchases, it leaves us with about $1 billion of just excess cash to use on acquisitions or if we don\u2019t find them presumably raising our repurchase amount. Craig Arnold : I might add to that Rick, and we\u2019ve been, we\u2019ve been quite aggressive quite frankly. If you take a look over the last four years, in aggregate, we\u2019ve we bought back some 13% of our shares over the last four years. And so we are certainly willing to step in, when we see these opportunities of weakness, and buy the stock back and given our dividend yield and the current stock prices, we think that it\u2019s a tremendous value to buy Eaton at these levels. Julian Mitchell : Great. Thank you very much. Donald Bullock : Our next question comes from David Raso with Evercore. David Raso : Hi. Good morning. I apologize, had phone issues earlier, so I apologize if this has been asked. Just trying to figure out the first quarter organic is slower than the full year. So obviously there's some assumption of some reacceleration as the year goes on. But the comps don't really get any easier. You mentioned ESS starts the year little bit slower on the step down, but the backlog for that business has been up double-digit for three quarters the orders have been the obviously lumpy in the third quarter, but two of the three quarters have been strong. So I am just maybe trying to dig into little bit more why ESS organic slows that much in the first quarter? And if we think of the businesses that you said maybe they start a little bit of a pause period, the acceleration in growth as the year goes on, is that more ESS? Is it aerospace? Just try to understand so that we have a cadence correct? Craig Arnold : I appreciate the question, Dave and we did talk about this little bit earlier. And I think it\u2019s really we talked about this. The level of economic uncertainty that exist in the marketplace right now across so many parts of the world that\u2019s really giving us a little bit of a pause with respect to how aggressive we are on this Q1 number. And so I'd say it's really that issue more than anything that has been baked into thinking around acceleration. I mean, you have Brexit coming up. You have trade disputes with China. You have debt issues in the U.S. and so there\u2019s a so many, I\u2019d say, let\u2019s call it geopolitical issues that we\u2019re dealing with around the world that we thought that it would potentially have an impact on Q1 activity levels and that's really what\u2019s baked into our thinking. David Raso : Well, I guess more directly. I\u2019m just trying to figure out. Is there something you're actually saying, meaning anything reflective of what we saw on September? Maybe the backlog that you have -- have a little more -- they are little bit further out than traditional. I\u2019m just trying understand how much is \u2013 again prudent understanding of some economic uncertainty right now versus something you're actually saying? That\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to dig into. Craig Arnold : Yes. No. I'd say that if you characterized the backlog there\u2019s really been nothing in terms of the characterization of the backlog whether that's in Electrical Systems & Services or hydraulics or the other businesses where we build backlog. The characterization and delivery timeframe of our backlog does not look significantly different than it looked historically. David Raso : Okay. Now I appreciate the color. Thank you. Donald Bullock : Our next question comes from Steve Volkmann with Jefferies. Steve Volkmann : Hi. Good morning guys. Thanks for fitting me in. So, just may be related to that. I mean, historically I guess when ESS orders start to ramp up and backlog stretches out a little bit there's an opportunity to be a little bit more aggressive with pricing. Can you just talk about what pricing looks like in your order book in ESS? And how much that might have some upside going forward? Craig Arnold : Yes. I think the way we generally think about pricing in general, Steve, is that, as to me there are net positive or net negative as we tend to over time offset commodity driven cost increases with price in the marketplace. And I would say today the pricing environment overall on Electrical Systems & Services is better than it's been, better than it\u2019s been largely because of the level of economic activity overall has been better over the last 12 months or so. So, I'd say, as we think about price in general I wouldn't really think about it being a big contributor to pricing, but I think the overall environment today makes it a little bit easier as we think about negotiating with on large projects and with customers simply because from a capacity standpoint, in many cases we\u2019re sold out, our competitors have sold out lead-times and in some cases have pushed out. And so I do think the environment overall is a little better as a function of volume more than anything else in our factories. Steve Volkmann : Okay. All right. Fair enough and maybe I\u2019ll ask only eMobility question. Obviously there's lots of platforms that are getting announced for the early 20s. Is it too early for you guys to have actually signed any contracts for any of those platforms? Or is that actually happening? Craig Arnold : Yes. I'd say that, we have signed some contracts already. Most of what we signed to-date there\u2019s been relatively small, but I'd ask you to stay tune. Steve Volkmann : I will stay tune. Thank you. Donald Bullock : Next question comes from Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc. Jeff Hammond : Hey, morning guys. Craig Arnold : Hi. Jeff Hammond : Hey. Just a couple of final point questions. One, your margins in EPG looked a little bit lighter on the incremental, any anything there to point out? Richard Fearon : What I try to comment on that one, Jeff, appreciate the question, because as you mentioned margins were a little bit lighter than we anticipated as well. And this is largely a function of product mix. And as you think about that to be a very large segment and when you have some of the segments that have lower overall margins growing a little faster; lighting for example that tend to have an impact on your margins overall. But I'd say, overall absolutely nothing to worry about there. The margins in EP are at very high levels and as you saw our guidance going forward we feel very good about 2019. Jeff Hammond : Okay. Then vehicle, looks like you\u2019re calling for the markets to be flat to up and yet organic decline is -- anything to read into that in terms of share shift? Or is that just the Cummins JV moving around? Craig Arnold : Yes. It\u2019s really the Cummins JV. And it\u2019s another question I appreciate, Jeff, because there has been a little bit of confusion around the way the JV impact easting it. So as the JV increases, as the world continues to consume and move from more manual transmissions to automated transmissions that revenue ends up showing up in the joint venture as I mentioned that the JV revenues grew 45% in Q4. And so we obviously get piece of the profits, but you\u2019ll find it as we move forward the revenues for our business really have to be looked at, I\u2019d say, largely in combination with the joint venture. We really want to get a sense for how we\u2019re doing in the marketplace. But it\u2019s really that issue that is driving essentially the flat revenues. Jeff Hammond : Okay, great. Thanks Craig. Donald Bullock : Next question comes from Andy Casey with Wells Fargo. Andy Casey : Good morning everybody. Donald Bullock : Hi. Andy Casey : Question on the margin outlook and price cost. Does that 2019 guide embed neutral price cost? You typically do that. And I\u2019m wondering because you probably going to have carryover pricing benefit that spills in the 2019. And you may see raw material cost decline as the year progresses? Craig Arnold : Yes. I\u2019d say that what we generally do build in, Andy, to exactly your point is we build in neutral. And there\u2019s always a little bit of timing on the upside and downside depending upon what\u2019s happen with commodity prices. And so typically speaking as commodity increase environment we tend to be a quarter or two behind it. In a deflationary environment we tend to be maybe a quarter or so or two above it, but over the period of say, a 12 month period it kind of washes out to be neutral. And that\u2019s really what we baked into our plan. Specifically as it relates to tariff and what we said in the Q3 earnings call was that we expect $110 million of headwind associated with tariffs. Since then the implementation had been delayed by two months. And so we think that number is now at $100 million, but our base assumption today still would assume that the tariffs -- the phase three tariffs moving from 10% to 25% go into effect and that our teams essentially go out and offset that with incremental price, but don't necessarily get a normal incremental margin on the additional tariff driven cost increases. Andy Casey : Okay. Thank you, Craig. And then on that 4x impact, the 250 million for the year, is that heavily weighted to the first quarter? Craig Arnold : Yes. It would be more heavily weighted towards the first quarter, just given where how currencies have performed during the course of 2018, that\u2019s be largely true. Andy Casey : Okay. And does that weigh out in the margin for the first quarter at all? Craig Arnold : Yes. I\u2019d say, not really. It really doesn't in terms of the margins itself and it really doesn't weigh on the margin. It certainly weighs on EPS for sure, but it really doesn't necessarily weigh on the margin rates. Andy Casey : Okay. Thank you very much. Donald Bullock : Our next question comes from Mircea Dobre with Baird. Mircea Dobre : Hi. Good morning guys. Going back to EP, maybe try and understand your growth guidance a little bit better. I'm trying to figure out exactly how you\u2019re thinking about getting to 4% to 5% growth. We really haven't seen order growth to that extend yet. Is this simply a factor of lighting no longer being a headwind and everything else pretty much staying the same or some other end market acceleration in there? Richard Fearon : I think you kind of hit the nail on the head Mircea, with that one. As you think about what we talked about the course of 2018 where we've made some very specific decisions around our lighting business and walking away from business that wasn't profitable. And during the course of 2018 that business actually contracted some low to mid-single digits. And as we look forward that goes from a negative to a positive. And so that's really what's driving the big difference in the relative growth rate in our EP business. Mircea Dobre : All right. That\u2019s helpful. And then back on vehicle you're expecting some margin expansion there even though obviously revenues not so much, so what exactly you generating that? And as you look maybe beyond 2019 presumably this businesses going to start see some volume deterioration. How do you plan on managing that? Craig Arnold : Yes. I\u2019d say, one of things that we talk about is the fact that we set this joint venture up obviously with Cummins and we don't consolidate the revenue, but we obviously get half of the earnings until the JV we\u2019ll see revenue growth, our earnings growth in 2019 and that will obviously be -- will help us with margin expansion. And then I would say, more broadly, I mean, this is just a business and a management team that just done an outstanding job over decades of very efficiently running our business. And so operational improvements, efficiency improvements, cost out is something that we do extraordinarily well as a company and even better within our vehicle business. And so, we would fully expect that this business continues to operate at very high levels of margins even in the event of economic downturn of somewhat. Mircea Dobre : Thanks. Donald Bullock : Our next question comes from Andrew Obin with BofA Merrill Lynch. Andrew Obin : Hey. Good morning. Thanks for fitting me in. Craig Arnold : Hi. Andrew Obin : Just with economic cycle being so healthy and you guys executing well. How do you think about your capacity overall and North American capacity specifically, how do you deal with these high volumes? Craig Arnold : I\u2019d say that, it\u2019s one of the reason, Andrew, I appreciate the question that our incremental rates as we provided our guidance in 2019 are perhaps a little bit less than what we experience in 2018, but we are having to make some investments in a lot of our businesses that are running at very high levels whether that\u2019s Electrical Systems &Services, whether it\u2019s in Aerospace. We made some really big investments in hydraulics during the course of 2018. And so we are having to reinvest in capacity expansion in many of our businesses that are running at very high levels. And so I think that's really the way you deal with. You spend the dollars and you make the investments and in some cases you look at your business models as well around what you invest and what you rely upon your supply base to do, but by and large we are making investments to expand our capacity. Andrew Obin : And are you\u2019ll be thinking your global footprint? I mean, the ratio where you investing that\u2019s what I mean? Craig Arnold : No. What we always try to do is really manufacturing zone of currency. And so we try to minimize the amount of goods that we ship around the world. And so what we today sell in Europe we largely make in Europe and what we today sell in Asia we largely produce in Asian. And so, from a footprint standpoint there was a lot of work that we've done over, say, the last 15 to 20 years around making sure that we have manufacturing capability and facilities in the right regions of the world. Most of that work is largely done. And so today it's really expanding where we need to in those regions of the world where we have capacity constraints. Andrew Obin : And just a follow-up if I can. What\u2019s your cadence in China through the year what are you expecting? Craig Arnold : I\u2019m sorry, your cadence around\u2026 Andrew Obin : Oh, just cadence of revenue growth in China in 2019 through the year seasonality how you want to address it? Thank you. Craig Arnold : Yes. I\u2019d have to probably go, take a look at that question specifically as it relates to China. I don't have that level of detail in front of me. But I would say that in general what our belief is that the Chinese government will likely stimulate at some point we saw as you saw as well, the significant slowdown in the economy in Q4 specifically highlighted by what took place in the light vehicle markets which were down some 16%. So we believe and I think it\u2019s largely belief that the Chinese government will stimulate at some point during the course of the year. So we do think that the second half of the year is stronger than the first half. But beyond that it\u2019s difficult to really estimate at this point. Andrew Obin : Thank you very much. Donald Bullock : At this point in time we\u2019ll have time for one last question, Rob McCarthy with Stephens. Rob McCarthy : Thanks for fitting me in for the buzz. Can you hear me? Craig Arnold : Yes. Rob McCarthy : Sure. Two questions. One just on oil and gas, how do you think about your exposure there given the fact that you\u2019ve seen the experience not only explicit oil and gas exposure but the implied bleeding of that oil and gas exposure into your industrial business. How do we think about the outer bound of that as we kind of think about your portfolio going forward and assessing the risk of what could be a continued downdraft year? Craig Arnold : Yes. I appreciate the question Rob, especially given what I think we all experienced during the last kind of cyclically downturn in oil and gas market. And I\u2019d say, the first thing I just remind the group that we tend to be more downstream focus and we are upstream focus. So it has a much longer cycle. We saw a little bit pull back in oil prices in the fourth quarter, but they came rebounding in December. And I would say, by and large our business performed well through Q4 and we\u2019ve not really seen today any let\u2019s say significant changes in our business in terms of the outlook. The rig count actually for 2018, that actually ended up some 20% for the year when you compare the year overall. And so we think that oil and gas is always a bit of a wild card and tough to predict exactly where it\u2019s going, but given that we\u2019re really coming off of, let\u2019s call it a three or four year pretty significant downdraft in oil and gas market and we\u2019ve just got our legs underneath us that we think oil and gas holds up over next number of years. It\u2019s difficult for say for certain, but I think our base case would be that we don\u2019t see a significant retrenchment in capital spending round oil and gas. Rob McCarthy : I\u2019ll leave it there. Thanks. Craig Arnold : Thank you. Donald Bullock : With that, ladies and gentlemen we\u2019re going to wrap up the call. As always we\u2019ll be available for follow-up and questions following the call. Thank you.",

At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Yan Jin, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Yan Jin : Good morning. I'm Yan Jin, Eaton's Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you all for joining us today for Eaton's First Quarter 2019 Earning Call. With me today are Craig Arnold, our Chairman and CEO, and Rick Fearon, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial and Planning Officer. Our agenda today includes the opening remarks by Craig, highlighting the Company's performance in the first quarter. As we have done in our past calls, we will be taking questions at the end of Craig's comments. The press release from our earnings announcement this morning and the presentation we will go through today, have been posted on our website at www.eaton.com. Please note that both press release and the presentation include reconciliations to non-GAAP measures. A webcast of this call is available on our website and will be available for replay. Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our comments today will include statements related to expected future results of the Company and are therefore, forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our forecasted projections due to a wide range of risk and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and the presentation, that are also outlined in our related 8-K filing. And with that, I'll turn it over to Craig. Craig Arnold : Thanks, Jin. Appreciate it. Yes, I'll begin with Page 3 and the highlights of our Q1 results, and I begin by saying, we had a good start to the year with another strong quarter of performance. Earnings per share were $1.23 on a GAAP basis and $1.26 excluding the impact of the divestiture costs related to the announced spin-off of our Lighting business. At $1.26, our results were 15% above last year and toward the higher end of our guidance range, which as you will recall was $1.18 to $1.28. Our sales were $5.3 billion, up 4% organically and in line with our guidance, excluding the negative 3% impact from currency. And we continue to be pleased with our strong margin performance. Segment margins were 16% above the high end of our guidance range and 80 basis points over prior year. We also generated very strong operating cash flows of $551 million in the quarter, and this is up 63% from Q1 2018 and a first quarter record. And lastly, we repurchased $150 million of shares in the quarter as part of our plan to buy back $400 million of shares in 2019. So, a very good start to the year. Page 4 summarizes our income statement versus prior year. And I've covered most of these items in the summary comments and so I'll only point out once again, the 3% currency impact was driven primarily by the important currencies for us which are the euro, renminbi and real. We are very pleased with our 32% incremental rate that we delivered on organic growth. And so, that number was, once again, very strong and above our expectations. And we incurred as we mentioned, the $0.03 per share from the after-tax cost primarily related to the spin of our Lighting business. And as you can see adjusted earnings per share increased from 9%. Next, we summarize the quarterly results of our Electrical Products segment. Revenue here increased 2%, which includes 5% organic growth, partially offset by 3% currency. And we see particularly strength here in commercial and in residential construction with global growth rates in the mid-to-high single-digits and even stronger in the U.S. markets. Our orders increased 4% led by continued stroke, strength and growth in the Americas and our backlog grew double-digits, up 13% in the quarter. Segment operating profits grew 8% and operating margins were 120 basis points increase to 18.9% and this was a record for Q1. And we are actually pleased with how well the segment is performing and the consistency of results that we continue to see in this part of the Company. Moving to Page 6, we cover our Electrical Systems & Services results. Revenues here increased 6% with organic growth of 8%, partially offset by 2% currency and we saw especially strong double-digit revenue growth in commercial construction and in data centers. We continued to have solid momentum in this business and the year had started on a high note for sure. You will recall that our original guidance is for sales to be up 5% to 6% organically for the year, and so we are certainly running above that rate. As we indicated at our Investor Conference in March, we have moved to a rolling 12-month basis for reporting our orders in this long-cycle business, as well as in our Aerospace business that I'll cover soon. On a rolling 12-month basis, ES&S orders actually increased 8% with strength in all major end markets and regions. And maybe, I'll just pause for a moment on the orders here in the Electrical Systems & Services because I know it's a particular point of question that many of you have and I will tell you that our ES&S activity level is absolutely performing in line and perhaps maybe even a little bit better than what we anticipated. And we talked about this idea of moving to the rolling 12 months, because we do in fact see a lot of, let's say, call it lumpiness in the orders that we get in Electrical Systems & Services driven primarily by what we are seeing in hyper scale data centers. And the other indicator that we have that gives us a lot of confidence in the strength of this business is, is what we call negotiations. And our negotiations in this business in Q1 were an all-time record and up some 56% from prior year. And so despite what we are seeing actually in the orders and what some of you have reported to be a little bit of weakness versus what we saw in Q4, the overall underlying activity in this business continues to be very, very strong. Our backlog continued to grow, it was up 11% in the quarter. We generated strong operating leverage with operating profits increasing 15%, only 8% volume growth and margins increasing a 100 basis points to 13.1%. You will also recall that we announced the acquisition of the Ulusoy Electric business in January. We are pleased to have closed the purchase on April 15th and then this acquisition will certainly provide a strong platform for us as we serve our customers in EMEA and the Asia-Pacific markets. So once again, a really strong performance in our Electrical Systems & Services business and we continue to be quite bullish on the - for the outlook for that business as we go forward. On the next Page, we summarize our Hydraulics results for Q1. Revenues were down 3%, with 1% organic growth more than offset by a 4% currency. I'll certainly note that we had some tough comps in this business at 6% organic growth in Q1 2018, but revenue did slow slightly more than we expected, but I would probably note here only slightly more than what we had in our original plans for the year. Organic growth of 1% reflected continued growth in construction equipment, but some declines in Ag and in industrial equipment. Our orders stepped down 11%, driven principally by weakness in global mobile equipment markets and we also had tough comps here as well from last year, where orders were up some 14%. Backlog declined 6% in the quarter as well. And as we detailed at our Investor Conference, we continue to work through some inefficiencies in the business, but do expect to see strong margin performance in this business in the second half of the year as we work off some of the efficiency issues that we experienced in the second half of last year. And segment margins were 11.7%, down 100 basis points versus last year. And on Page 8, we summarize our Q1 results for the Aerospace business. And as you can see, this business just continues to perform at a very high level, delivering record performance across almost every single metric. Our revenues increased 10%, a 11% organic growth and 1% negative currency. Like ES&S, we moved to a rolling 12-month basis for reporting orders. And on this basis, orders increased 18% with particular strength in commercial transport, military fighters, military transport and both commercial and military aftermarket. So really strength across the board in this segment. Our backlog also increased significantly, up some 21% in the quarter. And lastly, we demonstrated very strong incremental margins with labor to add to a 30% increase and operating profits and a 300 basis point margin improvement in the quarter. Operating margins of 23.1%, another all-time high for the business. So in addition to the volume growth, we also experienced some favorable product mix in the quarter, but really strong execution by the team overall. Next, I'll move to a summary of our Vehicle segment. Our revenues were down 9%, which includes 6% reduction in organic growth and a negative 3% from currency. The organic sales decline was driven by a combination of declines in like global vehicle markets, which were down 45% and the ongoing impact of revenue transfers to the Eaton Cummins joint venture. And I will note that the joint venture actually saw revenue increases of 27% in the quarter and continues to perform very well. We also had tough comps in this business with organic growth, which increased 13% last year. But overall, this business is really performing as we have expected, but with a little bit of weakness in global automotive markets. For the year, we continue to expect NAFTA Class 8 production to be at 324,000 units, flat with 2018. But we have lowered our outlook for light vehicle markets for the year. And lastly, despite the lower volumes, operating margins increased 30 basis points to 15.1% and a decrement of margin on the organic of less than 20%. So really strong execution by the team, once again, in our Vehicle business. And wrapping up our segment summaries, we will cover our eMobility segment on Page 10. Revenues were up 8%, which includes 9% organic growth, partially offset by 1% currency. And as planned, we continue to accelerate our R&D spending, which increased by some 130% in the quarter. So we continue to invest heavily in this segment to participate in what we think is really an exciting growth opportunity as we move forward. We are certainly optimistic about the opportunities in this rapidly developing market, and our pursuit pipeline for new programs has actually now grown to $1.1 billion. At our Investor Conference in March, we did announce a new program win of a $100 million mature year revenue for traction inverters with a major global OEM customer and actually in mid-April, we announced that PSA is the customer for this program. This was our first significant event, since creating the segment about one year ago, and we are certainly ahead of our original schedule for growth in this segment and well on our way to accreting what we think is going to be a new $2 billion to $4 billion segment for the Company overall. At this point, I'll turn to our outlook for 2019, which is on Page 11. We now expect organic revenues for all of Eaton to grow approximately 4%, down slightly from our prior midpoint of 4.5% and this is largely the result of us increasing our guidance for our long-cycle businesses by reducing guidance for our short-cycle businesses. Specifically, we increased organic growth rates by 1% for both ES&S and Aerospace. And for Hydraulics, we lowered organic growth by 2% at the midpoint to 3% to 4% based upon some slow growth expectations in global mobile equipment markets. And for Vehicle coming off, what I would say really was a weak Q1 in light vehicle markets, we lowered our organic growth rate by three points at the midpoint, and now we expect organic growth to be down some 4% to 5%, and once again, due to primarily the automotive side of the business itself. And we have not changed electrical products or eMobility. And our margin expectations are noted on Page 12. We are modestly raising our guidance from 17.1% to 17.5% or 17.3% at the midpoint. We are lowering the margin expectations for Hydraulics by 60 basis points to 13.4% to 14% and for Vehicle by 90 basis points to 16.5% to 17.1% due to lower organic growth primarily. But this is more than offset by increases in Electrical Products and in Aerospace margins. Our new expectation for Electrical Products is for margins to be between 19% and 19.6%, a 50 basis point increase at the midpoint and the new expectation for Aerospace is for margins to be 21.8% to 22.4%, also a 40 basis point increase at the midpoint. And the other two segments remain unchanged. So at the midpoint, 17.3% and this would naturally be another record level of performance for Eaton overall. And lastly on Page 13, we summarize our guidance for Q2 and for the year. For Q2, we expect adjusted earnings per share to be between $1.45 and $1.55 and at the midpoint, this represents an 8% increase over last year. Other assumptions in our guidance include, we are expecting 4% organic growth, foreign exchange impact of roughly $100 million. Our margin expectation for the quarter is that have margins between 17.2% and 17.6%. We would expect our corporate cost to be flat with Q2 of 2018 and we would expect the tax rate of between 13.5% and 14.5%. For the full-year 2019, we are raising our adjusted earnings per share guidance to $5.72 to $6.02 for the midpoint of $5.87, which includes essentially a $0.02 impact from the full-year impact of the acquisition of Ulusoy overall. At the midpoint, this continues to represent a 9% increase over 2018. Other full-year guidance assumptions include organic revenue growth of 4%. We would expect $100 million of revenue from the Ulusoy acquisition. We expect foreign exchange impact to be $300 million and this is a $50 million increase from prior guidance. We would expect, as I mentioned, segment margin of 17.3% and really no change to the other items in our forecast. So in summary, I would say another strong start for the year in Q1. We are well positioned to deliver another year of record results and we are absolutely thrilled with the way that the Company is performing overall. So with that, I'll turn it back to Yan for Q&A. Yan Jin : Okay. Thanks, Craig. Before we begin the Q&A session of our call today, I do see we have members of individuals peers that in the queue is present. So given our time constraint over to be an hour today and our desire to get to as many of these questions as possible, please limit your opportunity to just one question and a follow-up. So with that, I will turn it over to our operator to give you guys the guidance. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Yan Jin : Okay. We will take our first question from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Joseph Ritchie : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Craig, could you maybe expand on your comments on commercial and data centers being up double-digits in ES&S this quarter? We heard some conflicting news, especially in the data center side, out of the supply chain. And so any other further color you can provide there would be helpful. Craig Arnold : Yes, now the only thing I would tell you that, overall the data center market for us continues to perform very well. We are still running as I mentioned, our revenue is up double-digit for data center sales. Activity levels continue to be quite strong. I think the piece that I - that we are trying to clarify for the sake of all of you who follow the Company, that data center orders, especially when it comes to the hyper scale, they tend to be quite lumpy. So, you will get a big slug of orders in one quarter and they will be lighter the next quarter, and so that is why we made this decision to really move to a rolling 12 months, because we think it more accurately reflects the underlying economic activity that we are seeing in that market. But for us, we still see very good strength and data center activity overall, and we continue to think that is going to be one of our fastest growing segments. I mentioned once again, we take a look at negotiations, which is the level which for us is a good proxy for the level of economic activity that is taking place in the market. And as I mentioned, we are really experiencing record levels of activity in our Electrical Systems & Services business, but negotiation is up 56% in the quarter to record levels. And so, by and large, we have really seen no let up in activity in Electrical Systems & Services and data centers continues to be a bright spot for us. Joseph Ritchie : And Craig, within commercial, what are the verticals that are really driving the strength there? Craig Arnold : Yes, I would say we are really seeing pretty broad-based strengths in the commercial businesses overall. And certainly, oil and gas is - has come back and we mentioned this to strengthen data centers. We... Richard Fearon : Yes, for example if you look at straight up commercial like office and government, both up just over 10% institutional, just a little bit under that. But we are seeing broad-based strength in the commercial side of things. And if you look at some of the governmental data, C30 reports except for the new Dodge report Europe has seen, numbers that are high-single-digit, even low double-digits. So it, it's all pretty consistent. Craig Arnold : Right. It's broad too and we are seeing also strength really around the world as well. And in commercial businesses in general. So it's not just in the U.S. market. Joseph Ritchie : Now, that is helpful. Maybe my follow-on just on the Hydraulics business. You know it's interesting, because it sounded like when we had met intra-quarter, that Hydraulics had maybe gotten off to a better start in January, February. And you have talked about this, this business and all your businesses meeting to kind of earn the right to be part of the portfolio. Yet, we have taken guidance down already to start the year. And so can you just kind of contextualize how the quarter went with Hydraulics? And then also in terms of - like how it fits with the portfolio longer term? Craig Arnold : First of all I would say, as we have talked about and recovered during our Investor Day in general, that we have some work to do to fix, what I would call some self-inflicted wounds associated with some short move transition, site transition that we are managing internally as an organization. And we always believed that was going to be more of a kind of a second half kind of resolution to some of the internal issues. I think the new news for us in the Hydraulics business in terms of what really drove the reduction guidance is largely some of the weakness that we are seeing in some of our end markets. And so, I would say operationally as we acknowledge, we still have work to do to fix some of our own inefficiencies and our teams are working that. And we certainly would expect that stuff to be flushed through the system by the time we hit the second half of the year. But the new piece is really some of the weakness that we are seeing, largely in some of the mobile equipment market. And I would say that our orders were certainly weak in Q1. If you take a look at some of our customers, all the names that you know well, I would say their sales are holding up better than our orders are. And so there could be a better outlook as we look forward. We are not sure to what extent. There is some inventory repositioning taking place in this segment. But right now, it's really more a function of weaker volumes. And at this point, I would say as we think about Hydraulics as a part of Eaton overall, today, we have a plan and the plan is a plan that we believe in. And our team is executing that plan and we fully expect the Hydraulics team to fix their operational issues and turn that into a business that we can all be proud of and would anticipate keeping as a part of the Company. But for Hydraulics, no different to any other part of the Company, we have expectations that we call all of our businesses accountable to. And we would expect them to meet the criteria that we set and if we can't meet the criteria for Hydraulics or for any part of the Company, we are willing to act when necessary. Joseph Ritchie : Thank you. Yan Jin : Our next question is coming from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Jeffrey Sprague : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Good morning. I was wondering if you could just come back to ES&S one more time anyhow? And just give us some color on what - negotiation is up 36% really means obviously it sounds good. Is that kind of a project value in dollars? Was there some kind of low ebb in Q1 last year that results in that being such a big healthy number and what kind of typical conversion rate would you have on kind of a negotiation? Craig Arnold : Yes, no. I mean, the first thing I'll just answer is kind of the question around noise. There is absolutely nothing in Q1 of last year that would suggest that we had a low bar to clear. As I mentioned, it not only was higher than Q1 last year, but it was a record all-time level and was significantly higher than any other quarter during the course of 2018. And I think just as you articulate, this is essentially the number of bid and quotations that we are making to our various customers on large projects that we bid on during the course of the period. And so, it really for us is probably the best proxy for the level of underlying economic activity that we have in that business. So we think it's a really strong indicator of the fact that this business, a long-cycle business that we would expect to be performing very well at this point in the cycle, is actually performing very much like we anticipate. Richard Fearon : And it will take time for some of these negotiation bids to become final bids, typically 90 days to 180 days, sometimes a little longer for big projects. But yet, it is quite notable just how strong the activity levels are. Jeffrey Sprague : And just as a follow-up separately on Ulusoy. Is it $0.02 accretive for the year, and therefore the sole reason for the guide or you'd actually more than that and there is maybe a negative offset somewhere else in the equation? Richard Fearon : No, it's $0.02 accretive and the way to think about it Jeff is, it's really $0.04 accretive, but we have $0.02 of our estimate right now of amortization of intangible costs. And so, that is how it ends up at $0.02. Jeffrey Sprague : Great. Thank you. Craig Arnold : But we are in fact holding all the other elements of the guide for the core business, and so no change at all. Jeffrey Sprague : Thank you. Yan Jin : Our next question is coming from Scott Davis from Melius Research. Scott Davis : Right. Good morning, guys. Just to be clear, the reason why you are not raising margin guidance on ES&S, is that because of mix and largely just because of the data center volumes, is that correct? Craig Arnold : First of all, I would say early in the year. I would say that our forecast for margins in ES&S is certainly today within the range that we set for the year. And a lot of the growth to your point, is coming from projects and so we will have to wait and see how that plays out. But right now, I would not in any way take it as a sign of concern about margins in our ES&S business. Things are going quite well and we are very pleased with our margins in Q1 and there is nothing today that I would say that would suggest that if there is anything to be concerned about. Scott Davis : Okay. And the -- it's been actually kind of get your take, Craig, on some of the M&A that is out there. I mean you have got a couple of competitors who have announced really big deals. Nothing seems cheap. They all seem to be relatively fully priced. But what is your take on the market out there and the likelihood that Eaton participates? I guess, there is two ways to think about it, you could be a seller of assets into this market of strength as easily as you could be a buyer of assets. So how do you think about that in the current? Craig Arnold : The first thing with respect to pricing and asset values in as you can see by some of the transactions that have been announced, I mean these properties are going for extraordinary prices. We have prided ourselves on the fact that we said we are going to be disciplined through this cycle, and we think that our cost of capital continues to be 8% to 9% and we want to deliver 300 basis points over our cost of capital. And so we will continue to be a disciplined buyer into a market that looks like assets being priced at extraordinary levels. And so I would say that we today, are looking at probably more deals than we have in a very long time, and so we have a very active pipeline as well. But we will make the commitment as we have in the past. We are not going to chase deals with what I would say are unattractive returns when you look at their cash on cash set of financial metrics. So that is kind of the way we look at it. Scott Davis : But the other side of that, obviously Craig, as you could sell something, I mean if people are willing to pay for a price and maybe now is the time to think about partnering with some of maybe a more cyclical stocks, is that a possibility? Craig Arnold : Yes. First of all, I would say we took a look at our businesses strategically through the cycle. And so as we think about the portfolio itself and how we hold to a seller, we are really trying to look at them over the long-term period and whether or not we think this is going to be a good strategic hole based upon the criteria that we established through the cycle. Now having said that to your point, if you have come to a decision that you want to exit as asset, now would be a great time to do it. But we generally take a longer term, let's say, more strategic view of the portfolio in terms of things that we want to - businesses that we want to be in versus businesses that we would choose to exit. Scott Davis : That is fair. Thank you and good luck to you guys. Craig Arnold : Alright, thank you. Yan Jin : Our next question from Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank. Nicole DeBlase : Yes, thanks. Good morning guys. So I just want to focus a little bit on Hydraulics. I know organic growth was 1% this quarter. Looks like in your full-year guidance you have brought it down a little bit, but you are still basically implying some improvement organic growth throughout the year. So I guess, I'm curious what is driving that conviction and maybe just frame that with how demand progressed throughout the quarter, if there was any sign of improvement in March or into early April? Craig Arnold : I would say that maybe to take your first question right out of the gate in terms of, certainly we are implying a little bit stronger growth in the back half of the year than we delivered in Q1. As I mentioned in my opening commentary, that 1% organic growth was actually within 1% of our internal plan. And so, we are actually not off our internal plan by a measurable amount in Q1. And the comps get easier quite frankly, as the year moves on. And we have very specific programs that we are working on as a company that will also help boost growth as we look into some of the out-quarters, very specific initiatives that we are working on, that have been largely bedded down, that are going to help improve our growth. And the other thing I would tell you is that, if you take a look at the major end markets that we serve construction equipment, Ag equipment, two of our big important markets in Hydraulics and you look at what our customers are saying, in most cases, they are still forecasting growth for the year. They are forecasting low single-digit kind of growth levels. And so we do believe that there was a little bit of inventory correction that took place in Q1 that probably also held down our relative growth rate. Nicole DeBlase : Okay, got it. Thanks, Craig. And then just shifting to Aerospace, the margin performance was really impressive this quarter. Was there anything special going on there? Is it a mix impact that isn't sustainable throughout the rest of the year just because the full-year guidance implies a little bit less margin expansion than we saw in the first quarter? Craig Arnold : Yes, I mean it certainly was a record quarter for margins in Aerospace, an all-time record, not just a record for Q1 and I would say that we did have a bit of favorable mix in Q1. Our aftermarket business on a relative basis was a bit stronger than our core OE business, and that certainly was a help for the quarter, but also the growth in the volume as well also helped push things up. And so I would say, principally, it was more a function of the mix of customers and the mix of OE aftermarket that really led to a really strong Q1 performance, that is probably not sustainable at those levels. But as you can see, we are forecasting margins for Aerospace that are once again at record levels and I would say even in many cases industry-leading levels. Nicole DeBlase : Got it. Thank you. Yan Jin : Our next question comes from Ann Duignan with JPMorgan. Ann Duignan : Hi, guys. Just back to ES&S again, I know you said bidding is up significantly, but traditionally what kind of success rates would you have been, what percent win versus not win have you had? Craig Arnold : We have pretty strong market share Ann, in our businesses. As you know, I mean, in our Electrical Systems & Services business, a lot of this activity is in the Americas market and we have industry-leading shares in this business. And so our win rate is going to be very much consistent with our underlying market share. So we do believe that this bidding activity will translate ultimately to growth in our business. Ann Duignan : Okay, that is helpful color. Appreciate it. And then back to Hydraulics also, I have to ask the question about North American agriculture, of course. Maybe you could talk about what your customers are saying there? Is that where the weakness was in the quarter in term of orders? And given how bad farmer sentiment is in the US, would you anticipate that maybe staying weaker than expected for the full-year? Craig Arnold : Yes, I mean, you are absolutely right that sales were actually quite decent in Ag in Q1. But the order rates in Ag was down. And to your point, it's farm incomes and underlying commodity prices being as weak as they are, that we think are certainly dampening some of the enthusiasm for the outlook in Ag markets. And I think our call on Ag for the year, we felt like it's kind of a low single-digit kind of grower for the year, but we do think that there is at least a cautionary kind of sentiment that is in the market today in and around Ag in general. Ann Duignan : Yes, I would think we would have a similar view of the Ag market for 2019 and maybe even into 2020. Okay, I'll leave it there just get back in line. Most of my other questions were answered. Thanks. Craig Arnold : Okay. Yan Jin : Our next question come from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Nigel Coe : Thanks. Good morning, guys. Just come back to Hydraulics and the backlog was down, I think 11% and I understand the backup is coming off a very high level. But I'm just wondering to get to your sort of 4% to 5% growth for the remainder of the year in Hydraulics, do have to see orders come back positive or can we still achieve that targets with orders remaining flat to negative? Craig Arnold : Yes, yes. The backlog Nigel was actually down 6% versus last year, but no problem at all, but I think the spirit of your question is once again very much like the question asked earlier, what gives us confidence that we can deliver the growth and the outlook for the year and I will say that while the backlog is down, it's still running at very, very high levels from a historical perspective. And so obviously the comparisons in general, the comps in general, get easier as the year wears on. And I think that is really the big message with respect to orders, with respect to sales, is that you have relatively easier comps as the year unwinds. We have some very specific initiatives that we have put in place as a company that are going to give us some growth that have been very well identified and we think once again that while there is a little bit of caution in the market, we do believe that the two big markets of Ag and construction continue to grow down the year. Nigel Coe : Okay, great. And then my follow-on question is the three-point delta on the Vehicle outlook. And obviously, we are looking at the light vehicle markets significantly weaker. So that is explainable, because I'm just wondering, given the complexity in the segments, how much of that revenue delta is caused by a shift between your legacy transmission business and the Cummins JV? Was that a factor at all? Any help there would be great. Craig Arnold : Yes, I mean, think in terms of you say the three point reduction in the growth for the quarter, I would say that was really driven principally by the weakness in global light vehicle markets around the world and you see the same data that we see. I mean China was down 10%; Europe was down for say, 3% to 4%; the Americas was down a couple of points and so, most of that weakness I would say, is really in the global light vehicle market. We do have, by the way, as I mentioned in my commentary, as the world moves from mails to automated transmissions, we continue to move more revenue into the joint venture with Cummins and that is a piece of what is going on in that business and the other one by the way, that I'll put it on the table because it becomes a much bigger impact in terms of the legacy business as we move forward. As the world moves to electrification and the eMobility segment, that also become revenue that comes out of our legacy vehicle business and shows up in eMobility. And so there are a number of factors that are going on that perhaps make the underlying revenue growth and our Vehicle business look worse than it really is. Nigel Coe : Okay, Craig. We will dig in offline. Thanks very much. Craig Arnold : Thank you. Yan Jin : Next question comes from Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc. Jeff Hammond : Hey. Good morning, guys. Just two on EPG, one, can you just talk about what is driving the margin bump without a change in sales? And then two, just as the Lighting spend has been announced, have you gotten any indications of interest that maybe a sale is likely or more likely than it's been? Thanks. Craig Arnold : Yes, I would say on the margins, largely in EPG, I would say primarily we are getting better execution and better conversion in the business than we originally anticipated when we put the plan together. And so, it really complements to the team for really executing and delivering on some of the cost-out initiatives that we put in the plan. And so things are just going a little better than what we anticipated. And that is kind of what drove the increase in guidance for the year. As we mentioned in terms of Lighting, first of all I would say that the process is moving along as we anticipated and the prime path continues to be to spin the business and we still expect to be ready to make sure that we can get that done by the end of the year. To your point specifically around outside interest, yes. As you can imagine, there has been a number of companies who raised an interest in potentially acquiring the business. And it's always good to have an option in of choice and so we will be obviously working through these two alternatives, but once again, the prime path that we are on, is to spin the business. Jeff Hammond : Okay and then just macro level on Europe, I mean there is been some talk about slowing there, you mentioned the auto. Can you just talk about any areas of resilience or particular weakness in Europe? Thanks. Craig Arnold : Yes, I think to your point around the macro environment in Europe and we all see the economic data coming out of Germany, would suggest that we are in fact seeing some slowdown in growth in Europe overall. Then, we have seen that as well across many of our businesses certainly seen it specifically in the short-cycle businesses. I would say very much like we are seeing in the US, the long-cycle businesses continue to perform well in Europe. So Electrical Systems & Services and data centers, specifically in Europe, Aerospace, obviously the global industry is doing well. And so I think, we have seen, I could perhaps on an accentuated basis, more or less the continuation of the same trends that we are seeing globally. But no question, Europe is a bit weaker. It's a bit weaker when you think about industrial markets and industrial controls and the like. But it's all incorporated in our guidance and we think that Europe essentially is not going to be terribly different than what we assumed when we put our profit plan together. Yan Jin : Our next questions comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Andrew Obin : Yes, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking my call. Just a question on China. Can you talk about sort of China progression during the quarter? Frankly, I would have expected Mobile China Hydraulics to be a bigger positive. So I was just surprised that they didn't move the needle as much. And if you can give us any color as to how April is developing in China. Thank you. Craig Arnold : Yes, I will say to your point, I mean China started off the year quite weak in January, and March was a much better month. And we see that and certainly the GDP data and the IP data specifically coming out of China. Even automotive markets were relatively speaking, stronger in the month of March than they were in the first two months of the year. And so I would say a lot of the economic stimulus that the Chinese government is putting into place are early indicators, but it would suggest that it is having the desired impact. And so we think China probably continues to strengthen from this point forward. Eaton overall, revenues actually grew in Q1 in China as a company. So it was - despite the fact that we had some weakness in automotive markets, we actually saw strong mid-single-digit growth in China, specifically. And to your point, yes, the Hydraulics, the excavator market was quite strong, up some 24%, I believe in Q1. It's an important market for us, but it's obviously not big enough to move the needle, given some of the offsets in other regions and other segments that are part of that business. But we do think China improves as we look forward. Richard Fearon : And Andrew if you look at some of the construction metrics in China, they were pretty positive in Q1 and got more positive as the quarter went on. So offer starts are up I think 18% and residential starts were up 12%. So you are seeing a lot of the stimulus in China start flowing into somebody's construction-related markets. Andrew Obin : And just the second question, you definitely highlighted strength in oil and gas. Can you give us more color sort of upstream, midstream, downstream and maybe some color, what specifically you are seeing at Crouse-Hinds? Craig Arnold : Yes. No, I would say we are definitely seeing strength in oil and gas. And we think our business in the oil and gas, that we had a good first quarter of revenue, a good first quarter of orders and we think in the market in 2019 kind of grows mid-to-high single-digits. And then there as a company, we play more downstream than we do upstream, and so we are more exposed to that piece of the market. But we do think you saw the rig count is up somewhat 9% or so in Q1. And so we do think oil and gas continues to strengthen. And that is what we are seeing in our business as well. Richard Fearon : And we are benefiting from some of these large downstream projects. For example, some of these LNG facilities that are being configured now and petrochemical, and so we are definitely more slanted toward downstream type applications. Andrew Obin : And how fast does it hit your backlog that oil price moves? Do you see it immediately or is there a lag? Craig Arnold : I would say there is generally a lag. I mean I have not studied that question in a lot of detail, Andrew. But there is clearly a lag from the move in oil price to them putting in place, capacity to increase drilling or exploration and certainly given the fact that we are downstream, and the LIBOR probably will even be bigger for us than it would be for companies who are more exposed on the upstream side. Andrew Obin : Perfect. Thank you so much. Yan Jin : Next question is from Deane Dray with RBC. Deane Dray : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Hey, maybe just touch on some of the variables in the quarter broadly that the number of the other industrial companies have called out as either a factor or not a factor. So I didn't hear anything particular about weather. Did that come into play? And you talked about the inventory adjustments. Did any of that you see any of your business experience a pull-in out of the first quarter into the fourth quarter last year, and might that have been a factor this quarter? Craig Arnold : And I would say, Deane, we try to stay away from those kind of tangential elements around weather and the light because it's really difficult to ascertain how that impacted your business. And so at this point, I would say that, was weather an impact in Q1, it could have been; was it big enough to fundamentally change the outlook or kind of the thesis on the year, I would say probably not. And to the point around pull-ins, we really didn't see over any material pull-ins as well at the end of, let's say Q4, that would have impacted our Q1 business. And so really none of these extraneous variables, I would say would have had a material impact on the results in Q1. Deane Dray : That is fair. And did you say how April started? Craig Arnold : No, we didn't. But I would say very much in line with the guidance that we just provided for Q2. We would expect 4% growth and I would say that what you are going to likely continue to see is that our long-cycle businesses Electrical Systems & Services and Aerospace and Electrical Products will continue to perform very well and as we mentioned, part of the reason why we have taken the guidance down in the short cycle business. So once again, I think the Company's revenue story is really playing out very much like we anticipated, perhaps with more extremes, with more strength in the long-cycle stuff offsetting perhaps a bit of weakness in the short-cycle businesses. Deane Dray : Thank you. Craig Arnold : Thank you. Yan Jin : Our next question comes from Andy Casey with Wells Fargo. Andrew Casey : Thanks, Craig. Good morning everybody. I apologize to beat a dead horse a little bit here. But on the Hydraulics margin decline and the reduced margin outlook, is some of that specifically the Q1 compression, is some of that related to accelerated restructuring? Craig Arnold : Yes, no, I would say that not really, Andy. I mean we obviously are continuing to do restructuring in our business in Hydraulics and so I would say, the margin compression really is largely a function of volume as we articulated earlier, and not because we are doing significantly more restructuring in the business. Now I won't say, a lot of focus obviously in Hydraulics and we certainly understand why at the end of the day, Hydraulics as a segment, accounts for less than 10% of our profits. And so, I think we have a really strong story in a lot of our other businesses that are just performing extraordinarily well and more than making up, quite frankly, for the little bit of a shortfall that we are having in Hydraulics business. But no, it's really not restructuring, it's really more volume and decrementals on the change in volume. Andrew Casey : Okay. Thanks, Craig. And then within Electrical Products, we highlighted some strength in residential, which a little bit surprising given some of the macro data that we have been seeing. Is that share gains or what are you seeing there? Craig Arnold : Yes, I mean Resi for us, it was really a standout performer, quite frankly, in Q1 where we saw strong revenue growth and strong order growth and largely we do think this is essentially this factor of as you move to higher valued electrical equipment with AFCIs and ground fault and the regulations and the codes that are driving standards, are certainly helping that business. But by and large, just as you know, housing prices are up. We are seeing a lot of remodels that that don't show up necessarily in the housing start data, but we continue to be quite bullish on Resi and that is certainly played out in Q1. Richard Fearon : Based on the data, we believe we have taken some care, but the market overall for Resi electrical equipment is pretty strong. That is what the mean data would show. And our belief is that, that is likely to last throughout this year. Craig Arnold : We think Resi construction is up, our business taking up mid-to-high single-digits for the year. So it's really a source of strength we think for the Company. Andrew Casey : Okay, thank you very much. Yan Jin : Our next question come from John Walsh with Credit Suisse. John Walsh : Hi, good morning. I guess, maybe a question on the margin. Can you talk a little bit about how the price versus commodity inflation, I guess, tariff bucket performed in the quarter and how you are thinking about that cadence for the balance of the year? Craig Arnold : Yes. Thank you. Appreciate the question. I mean, certainly as we said in the past and Q1 played out that way and we think the year as well is that we think price versus cost we think will be largely neutral for the Company. Commodity prices as you have probably all certainly noted have abated a little bit and the copper probably is the one holdout where copper prices are still running at relatively high levels, but most of the other commodities that are important to the Company, we have seen commodity costs reduce, and so obviously, that is a good thing for the Company. But also as we think about price and cost being kind of natural offsets for each other, less inflation we see, the less price we see though. The less tariff-driven cost increases that we see, we obviously can't pass that price in the marketplace. So we are very comfortable for 2019 that pricing cost will be largely neutral, very much like our guidance has been. John Walsh : Great. And then maybe one more way to attack the negotiations comment. It doesn't sound like you want to give the absolute number, but is there a way to give it as a multiple of revenue in the business just to kind of frame the size a little bit more? Craig Arnold : The size of negotiations as a percentage of revenue? John Walsh : Yes, or the absolute number. I mean a couple of people have attacked it around what the 56% increase means year-on-year. Just... Craig Arnold : Yes, I would say for us, we would really like not to give you a number, but I would tell you that it is a big enough number to give confidence and to be indicative of what the future of the business looks like. It is a very large, very material number. Yan Jin : Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Julian Mitchell : Hi, thanks for squeezing me. And maybe just a question around the short-cycle businesses, particularly Vehicle and Hydraulics. Worsening revenue outlook in both versus your prior guide, but you sound intensely relaxed about the cost outlook. I just wondered why maybe there wasn't a bit more urgency around cost reduction in both businesses in the face of the worst top-line outlook. And then on Vehicle, it may just be something smaller or something in the mix, but I think you had a sort of low double-digit decremental margin in Q1. The guide for the year implies maybe a 30% decremental for the year as a whole. So is there something changing in terms of mix or what have you later in the year? Craig Arnold : Yes, I mean maybe to address your first question first Julian, I mean I don't want to leave the wrong impression for a minute. To the extent that we have revenue shortfalls in any of our businesses, I can promise you that nobody is relaxed. Both our Vehicle business and our Hydraulics business is doing everything that they can. And in many cases more to flex the variable side of our cost, it's one of the key metrics that we track all of our businesses on, to the extent that they are flexing their cost down with changes and volume, but I would say for us that is table stakes. That is something that we expect of every business that we do every day. So it's not the kind of thing that say, we spent a lot of time talking about. The changes that we are talking about and revenue are not big enough to drive material changes in our restructuring plans, although in the event that the world changed dramatically, we would have the ability to do that. And so I can promise you nobody is in any way relaxed about ensuring that we are managing costs inside of our business. And then with respect to the decrementals in vehicle, yes, very strong decremental performance in Q1. For the balance of the year, perhaps a little bigger than that, but still well below what we would call as a normal decremental for our Vehicle business. And so once again, rest assured that our Vehicle team is on their game. They do a great job, always have, are managing costs in the face of a downturn. And so you can count on them continuing to deliver. Julian Mitchell : That is very helpful. And then my second question would just be around any interesting trends you'd call out in terms of inventory levels at OEMs or channel partners across the businesses? How do you feel about absolute inventory levels as they sit today and has there been any change in recent weeks or months? Craig Arnold : Yes, if you are maybe taking the channel first, because that is kind of where you typically would see the big changes. And I would say by and large not. Inventory today with our distributor partners are largely in line with where they have been historically and in line with their own outlook for revenue growth. And so we have really not seen any material change there at all. As I mentioned on the call, perhaps where we have seen some adjustments, is on the OEM side and some of the short-cycle businesses. But other than that, really inventories are very well managed. Julian Mitchell : Very helpful. Thank you. Yan Jin : At this point of the time, I will take the last question from Mig Dobre with Baird. Mircea Dobre : Great. Thanks for squeezing me in and I want to go back to a question that is been asked before on Vehicle. So looking at this change in organic growth guidance, I mean, correct me if I'm wrong, but when you issued this guidance, I think pretty much everybody knew some of the challenges that existed in the light vehicle space in terms of builds for the year. So trying to figure out what changed in your mind that prompted this guidance reduction? Is it really more driven by what is been happening with the JV? Is it shifts to eMobility or how do we think about this move? Craig Arnold : No, I would say really what we said, it's light vehicle markets around the world as I think is evidenced by Q1, have come in weaker at least than what we anticipated and I think in general, weaker than what most economic forecasters have anticipated. It has absolutely nothing to do with what is going on today inside of the commercial vehicle market. North America Class 8 truck continues to do just fine. The JV revenues, as I mentioned are growing nicely and certainly we have anticipated at the beginning of the year that there would be some transfer of revenue and that is largely on track. And this change really is a function of what we are seeing today, like global vehicle markets around the world now. We will have to see what the rest of the year brings, but certainly the Q1 weakness really in all three regions of the world is really what influenced largely our changing guidance for the year. Mircea Dobre : I see. Given the adjustment that you had to make the margin and the fact that margins are now going to be slightly lower year-over-year, as we look toward 2020 and we know the challenges that the commercial vehicle side of the business is going to have, is it fair for all of us to be thinking that margins will once again take a step down in 2020? Craig Arnold : No, I would say not. I mean, as you know, we have done a lot of work over the last number of years to really build the business inside of our Vehicle business that essentially delivers strong margins through the cycle. And certainly as you know, because we have the joint venture, a lot of that volatility that used to sit inside of our business in our portfolio is no longer there. We have done a lot of restructuring and so I would say, you should not expect this business to take a material change at all in profitability even with, let's say, North America Class 8 market that is down significantly from where it is this year. Mircea Dobre : Alright, thank you. Yan Jin : Okay, good. Thank you. We have reached the end of our call and we do appreciate everybody\u2019s questions. As always, Craig and I will be available to address all your questions today and do something the following weeks. Thank you all for joining us today. Craig Arnold : Alright, thank you. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using the AT&T Executive Teleconference Service. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants phones lines are in listen-only mode. And later, we will conduct a question. Just a brief reminder, today\u2019s conference is being conference is being recorded [Operator Instructions] At this point, I\u2019d be happy to turn it over to Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Yan Jin. Yan Jin : Good morning. I'm Yan Jin, Eaton's Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you all for joining us for Eaton's second quarter 2019 earnings call. With me today are Craig Arnold, our Chairman and CEO; and Rick Fearon, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial and Planning Officer. Our agenda today includes opening remarks by Craig highlighting the Company's performance in the second quarter, and as we have done in our past calls, we'll be taking questions at end of Craig's comments. The press release from our earnings announcement this morning and the presentation we will go through today have been posted on our website at www.eaton.com. Please note that both the price release and the presentation include reconciliations to non-GAAP measures. A webcast of this call is accessible on our website and will be available for replay. Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our comments today will include statements related to expected future results of the Company and are therefore forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our forecasted projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and the presentation. They are also outlined in our related 8-K filing. With that, I will turn it over to Craig. Craig Arnold : Okay. Thanks, Yan. Appreciate it. And let's start with Page 3, and a highlight of our Q2 results, and I'd say, overall we delivered solid Q2 financial performance, and on the back of what I'd really call good execution across the company. Earnings per share of $1.50 on a GAAP basis and $1.53 excluding transaction and integration costs related to the acquisitions and divestitures. So at $1.53 per share, our results are 10% above last year and at the high end of our guidance range, which was $1.45 to $1.55. Our sales of $5.5 billion were up 2.5% organically, partially offset by 1.5% of negative currency, and similar to Q1, we continue to deliver strong margin performance. Segment margins of 17.9% are an all-time record for Eaton including records for Electrical Products, Electrical Systems & Services, and Aerospace. Our margins were also above the high end of our guidance range and 90 basis points above prior year. We also generated very strong cash flow - operating cash flow of $880 million, up some 76% over Q2 of 2018, and once again, our second quarter record. And lastly, we repurchased $260 million of our shares in the quarter, bringing our year-to-date purchases to $410 million or 1.2% of our shares outstanding at the beginning of 2019. Turning to Page 4, we provided summary of our income statement versus prior year, and I'll only highlight a couple of points here. First, we're very pleased with our incremental margins which were about 50% on the organic growth that we delivered in the quarter, so, once again, strong execution. Second, we incurred about $0.03 per share of after-tax costs, primarily related to the spin-off of our Lighting business. And finally, adjusted earnings increased 7%, and as we noted, adjusted EPS increased some 10%. Moving to Page 5, we summarized the quarterly results of our Electrical Products segment. Revenues were up 2%, which includes 4% organic growth, partially offset by 2% negative currency. Organic growth was driven by growth in both commercial and residential markets largely in the North American market. Orders increased 1% led by continued growth in residential and commercial construction in the Americas, partially offset by softness in some of the industrial markets, and our backlog was up 4%. Segment operating profits grew 8% and operating margins were up 110 basis points to 19.6%, which was once again an all-time record. So we continue to be pleased with how well the segment is performing, both in terms of organic growth and in margin performance. On the next page, we summarized results for our Electrical Systems & Services segment. Revenues were up 5% with 5% organic growth and 1% growth from Ulusoy acquisition and 1% negative currency impact. Organic growth was driven by strength in the industrial projects as well as in commercial construction markets. On a rolling 12-month basis, Electrical Systems & Services orders were up 3% with growth really across all regions. And I'd say it's worth noting here that prior year orders included an unusually high level of orders in hyperscale data centers. Excluding hyperscale data center orders, rolling 12-month orders were up some 8%, which is in line with our order growth in Q1. In addition, our backlog continue to grow and it increased some 2% in the quarter. Electrical Systems & Services also produced all-time record margins of 17.4%, which were up some 240 basis points from prior year. The strong operating performance included solid operating leverage with profits up some 22% on 5% organic growth. Page 7 has our Hydraulics results for Q2. Revenues were down 3% and that's flat organic growth with 3% negative currency. Similar to Q1, we had tough comps with 13% organic growth in Q2 of '18, but revenue continued to slow. Flat organic revenues reflect a growth in industrial equipment largely offset by declines in agriculture and construction equipment. Our orders declined 8% from continued weakness in global mobile equipment markets really around the world and our backlog declined some 12%. Segment operating margins were 11.5%, in line with Q1, but certainly down some 200 basis points from last year. I'd say here, we continue to work through some inefficiencies and costs related to repositioning the business during the quarter, but we made significant progress and we expect a better second half of the year. On the next page, we show our Q2 results for our Aerospace business. Similar to Q1, the business continued to perform at a very high level, really delivering record performance on almost every metric. Revenues were up 12%, with 13% organic growth, negative 1% currency. Orders on a rolling 12 month basis increased 15% with particular strength in commercial transport, military fighters and commercial aftermarket. And our backlog continues to remain robust and it increased from 17% in the quarter. Again, we demonstrated really strong incremental margins which led to a 41% increase in operating profits and a 520 basis points improvement in margins. Operating margins of 24.6% were another all-time high for the business. In addition to volume growth, we also experienced some favorable product mix in the quarter, which certainly helped. Lastly, we're very excited to have announced in July, Eaton's commitment to acquire Souriau-Sunbank Connection Technologies for $920 million. Souriau is a leader in aerospace connectors and provides us with the capability to more effectively serve more electric aircraft systems, which is certainly a trend in the industry. But beyond Aerospace, we also have a significant opportunity to expand the distribution of Souriau's products to our large electrical wholesale network, and as the whole world just becomes more electric, we think this technology and capability really becomes a real growth platform for Eaton. Souriau has grown historically in mid single-digit levels over the last several years and we think we're paying a really attractive multiple of 11.8 times EBITDA before synergies and 7 times to 8 times EBITDA on an after-synergy basis. Moving to Page 9, we summarized our Vehicle segment. Our revenues were down 11%, which includes a 9% reduction in organic growth and negative 2% from currency. Similar to Q1, organic sales declined 2%, was driven by a combination of decline in light vehicle markets, which we think were off some 7% and the impact of revenues that transferred into the Eaton-Cummins Joint Venture. I will point out that the revenues in the joint venture increased some 11% in the quarter. And also similar to Q1, we had tough comps, organic growth in Q2 of 2018 were some -- up some 11%. For the year, we continue to expect NAFTA Class 8 production to be roughly flat at 324,000 units, and we also expect global light vehicle markets to remain weak, and as a result, we've lowered our market outlook for the year. Operating margins were 16.9%, which were down some 160 basis points from prior year, but I would point out, up 180 basis points sequentially despite slightly lower revenues versus Q1. So once again, really strong execution in our Vehicle segment. Lastly, we summarized our eMobility segment on Page 10. Revenues were up 1%, which includes 2% organic growth, partially offset by 1% negative currency, and I'd say here, the slower organic growth is made up of continued double-digit growth in the EV passenger market, partially offset by slower internal combustion engine markets, and you should note that in this segment today is still some two-thirds of our revenue goes into legacy internal combustion engine and commercial vehicle markets. This will certainly change dramatically as electric vehicle segment continues to grow as electrification continues to grow, but for right now, it is still two-thirds legacy IEC markets. And as planned, we continue to accelerate R&D spending, which increased some 70% in the quarter, and as a result, segment margins declined to 8%. We're also extremely pleased to announce that we won another large program valued at $160 million of mature year revenue for a high voltage inverter for a new plug-in hybrid platform. So this was our second significant win since we created the segment just over a year ago and we certainly referenced this in our press release, but this brings our total new wins to $390 million since the segment was formed in 2018. So we're ahead of our original schedule, and once again, well on our way to creating a $2 billion to $4 billion segment of the company. Moving to page 11, we turn to our outlook for 2019. We now expect organic revenue for all of Eaton to grow approximately 3%, down from our prior estimate of 4%. This reflects moderating global growth, particularly in Europe and in China, and specific weakness in our short cycle businesses, very much like you've heard from other companies. We're lowering our organic growth rate by 3% for both Hydraulics and the Vehicle segment, and in the Hydraulics, we continue to see slow growth expectations in global mobile equipment markets and so now we expect roughly flat organic growth for the year, and in Vehicle, after a weak first half, we now expect organic revenues to be down some 7% to 8% due to continued weakness in global automotive markets and please remember once again that we are seeing strong growth in our Eaton Cummins Joint Venture. We are also lowering our organic growth for our eMobility segment from 11% to 12% down to 5% to 6% due to once again slower growth in legacy internal combustion engine platforms. We've not changed Electrical Products, Electrical Systems & Services or Aerospace as our long cycle businesses continue to perform in line with our guidance. And on Page 12, we summarized our margin expectations for the year. Our Eaton consolidated segment margin guidance remains unchanged with a range of 17.1% to 17.5% or 17.3% at the midpoint. We've narrowed the range for each of our segments to be plus or minus 20 basis points since we've really delivered the first half of the year and it's behind us at this point. We do have some puts and takes in margins with a 70-basis point increase in ESS and 90-basis point increase in Aerospace, offsetting a decline in the Hydraulics segment, and the midpoint of our margin for the other segments remain unchanged. Our full year guidance for Q3 and 2019 are summarized on the last page, Page 13. For Q3, we expect adjusted earnings per share of $1.50 to $1.60 per share. At the midpoint, this represents an 8% increase over last year, excluding the impact of the arbitration decision in 2018. Other assumptions in Q3 guidance include approximately 3% organic growth, margins of 17.7% to 18.1%, flat corporate expenses, and a tax rate of 16% to 17%. For the full-year 2019, we're maintaining the midpoint and narrowing our adjusted EPS guidance range by $0.05 at both the bottom and the high end of the range. Our new range is $5.77 to $5.97 per share, and at the midpoint, $5.87. This once again represents a 9% increase over 2018 excluding once again the impact of the arbitration decisions last year. Other full year guidance assumptions include organic revenue growth of 3%, a $100 million of revenue from the Ulusoy acquisition, foreign exchange impact of a negative $300 million, unchanged from prior forecast, segment margins of 17.3% at the midpoint, also unchanged, and we've narrowed the guidance range for our full-year tax rate to 14.5% to 15.5%. Once again, no change at the midpoint, but narrowing the range. However, our strong first half cash flows are allowing us to really increase our operating cash flow and free cash flow guidance for the year by some $200 million. Operating cash flows will now be between $3.3 billion and $3.5 billion, and free cash flow will be between $2.7 billion and $2.9 billion. We're also increasing our share repurchases from $400 million to $800 million for the year. So, overall, I step back and say, a really strong start to the year, a strong first half, we're well positioned for another year of good results, and our teams are doing a great job of executing in face of the opportunity in front of us. And so with that , I'll turn it back to Yan and open it up for Q&A. Yan Jin : Okay. Thanks, Craig. Before we begin the Q&A section of our call today, I do see we have a number of individuals in the queue with questions. Given our time constraint of an hour today, an hour is there to get to as many of these questions as possible. Please limit your opportunity to just one question and a follow-up. Thanks for your cooperation in advance. With that, I will turn it over to operator to give you guys the guidance. Operator : Certainly [Operator Instructions] Yan Jin : Okay. We will take our first question from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Jeff Sprague : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Craig Arnold : Hi, Good morning, Jeff. Jeff Sprague : Hey, good morning. First, just thinking about Hydraulics and Vehicle, this is obviously the second quarter in a row now we've marked down the top line and marked down the margin outlook a little bit. Would you say, the forecast as you've laid it out here, is kind of a run rate forecast on what you see over the balance of the year? Or are you making some underlying assumption that things pick up? And I was wondering if you could also just, as part of that, just elaborate on how we get comfortable with the Hydraulics margins given kind of the recent trajectory there? Craig Arnold : I appreciate the question, Jeff. And I'd say, I think you've characterized it the right way. It's really a look at kind of run rate in those two businesses, specifically with respect to growth, certainly in Vehicle markets, global markets around the world have been weak in the first half of the year and \u2013 and we're essentially assuming that we see a similar picture for the balance of the year, perhaps with a little bit of a pickup in the China market, given kind of the depth of the fall that we experienced in the first half of the year. But other than that, it's really largely run rate in both of those businesses, and I'd say specifically in Hydraulics, today what we continue to see in Hydraulics is we can only see inventory correction take place in the channel both in distribution as well as in OEMs and we're also clearly seeing today our lead times have been reduced and so there is a fairly sizable inventory correction taking place across the board, and the economic activity, if you take a look at kind of retail sales, those numbers are much better than what we're seeing certainly in the underlying order intake, and so it's largely kind of a run rate picture. And then specifically, with respect to margins in Hydraulics, I'd say, Q2 is essentially the last quarter where we really were dealing with a number of inefficiencies and repositioning costs, and so what we're really banking on going forward is that essentially normal kind of incremental decrementals on the business, but without the additional kind of repositioning costs and inefficiencies that we've experienced in the business in the first half of the year. So very comfortable with the second half guidance at this point for Hydraulics. Jeff Sprague : And maybe then as my follow-up to all that, Craig, thank you, is just on the inventory correction that you are seeing, do you have any way to kind of gauge how far along we are in that process? How much in excess inventory it might be out there? And how many quarters it takes to run its course? Craig Arnold : I'd say really difficult to estimate, Jeff, as you know, so much of this is a function of kind of the everyone's forward view of where markets are going. And given a lot of the economic uncertainty and trade uncertainty that we've been dealing with, I think everyone is trying to find a way through in terms of figuring out how much real underlying demand do we have versus how much of this is just general nervousness that we're experiencing as a result of these other extraneous factors, and so I'd really -- difficult to judge for certain. I will say that as we take a look at inventory levels in the channel, we did see really more broadly and also a little bit in our electrical business as well, some inventory correction that took place, but it's really difficult to call in terms of whether or not it's don, is more out in front of us or at the point now where we're comfortable really building some inventory back into the system. Jeff Sprague : Great. Thank you. Yan Jin : Our next question comes from Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc. Jeff Hammond : Hey, good morning, guys. Craig Arnold : Good morning, Jeff. Jeff Hammond : Just a few questions on the electrical side. One, you had talked about the big step-up in ESS margins, congrats there, just no real revenue change, what's really driving the step-up there? And then just any update on the Lighting spin, when do we expect like a Form 10 et cetera? Thanks. Craig Arnold : Yeah, I'll take the first half, and then I'll let Rick take the second. But in terms of ES&S and the margin step-up, I'd say, in a word, I'd say it's strong execution. Our teams are just doing an outstanding job of converting on the opportunities in front of us and running our facilities better. As we've talked about in the past, we've done some work around the portfolio and where we're choosing to compete, and those things are paying off in the form of higher margins inside of the business. And so we're very comfortable with the level of margin guidance that we provided and taken the margins up and our teams are just doing a great job of executing, and we'd expect that to continue. Richard Fearon : And on the Lighting spin, Jeff, we've had initial comments from the SEC, relatively modest set of comments and so we would expect to get the Form 10 filed towards the end of the third quarter, might just lap into the beginning of October. But that's the time frame. Jeff Hammond : Okay and then just as a follow-on on the Souriau acquisition, you gave kind of the adjusted valuation with synergies. Can you kind of expand on where you think those opportunities are? I recall the business has a fairly large France footprint, and so I know it's sometimes those costs are onerous to take out. Thanks. Craig Arnold : Yeah, I appreciate the question, once again, Jeff. And I think today they run a very effective operation today in France by the way, and so we have no intentions of closing any of the French manufacturing facilities, if that is the basis of your question. Today, as you know, we operate today as Eaton in France and we operate very successful businesses in the country. And so we're very comfortable with their manufacturing operations in France. We're right now and in the period of obviously putting into some of the finishing touches on what our exact integration plans are going to be. We've not communicated those plans for the organization yet and so clearly before we'd make any public statements, we'll obviously need to work through our own internal announcements. But specifically as it relates to manufacturing in France, very comfortable with that team, very comfortable with their capabilities and how effectively they've managed that business over a very long period of time. Jeff Hammond : Okay, great. Thanks, Craig. Yan Jin : Our next question comes from Scott Davis with Melius Research. Scott Davis : Hi, good morning, guys. Craig Arnold : Good morning. Scott Davis : I wanted to just follow up a little bit on the questions around visibility, inventories et cetera. I mean, can you give some granularity on what types of projects you're seeing in non-res in your backlog? Craig Arnold : Yeah, I'd say that when we think about kind of what's going on today in Electrical Systems & Services, I'd say, particular strength certainly in the US, commercial construction continues to be quite strong, orders were up some 6% in Q2. Industrial orders were also up nicely in the quarter. So, we're seeing pretty broad-based strength in our Electrical Systems & Services business, we had a really strong quarter of orders in the US as well. If we look at kind of around the world in terms of what's going on in other regions of the world where Europe, what we call EMEA, Europe, Middle East, Africa, India, we saw big projects in industrial also in data centers , data centers in Europe were up strongly in Q2, Crouse-Hinds business, oil and gas, had a very strong Q2 as well as our Engineering Services business in Europe as well also strong. And in Asia where we saw the strength primarily was in power quality markets, which were up double-digit in the quarter. And so I'd say that in Electrical Systems & Services, we're seeing, generally speaking, nice growth in almost all of the end markets other than what we talked about, which was a highly cyclical piece of the segment, which is kind of the hyperscale data centers where those orders just tend to be lumpy and we're really anniversarying some really huge numbers from the Q1 and Q2 of 2018. Other than that, we're seeing pretty good strength across residential, commercial, data centers and industrial buildings. Scott Davis : Seemingly so, but does it scare you at all, Craig, when you look across just across more broadly across industrials, I mean the quarter has been pretty weak overall, and you guys have had decent numbers of course, but is there a recession playbook that you guys are dusting off? Is there - are you - is there any internal plans to delay hiring or do anything to kind of play a little bit more defense versus offense? Craig Arnold : Yeah, I mean I think it's fair to say that we too have seen kind of the general slowdown in the macro economy during the course of Q2, and it's obviously caused this -- all of this kind of stop and pause and take stock of what's generally going on in the market and where we think things are headed. And so I think it would be fair to say that we always have a restructuring playbook ready, at the ready, we always encourage our businesses and our teams to think about what would you do in the event of an industrial recession and I'd say you can be rest assured that our teams are thinking about that, have plans at the ready, but at this point, we're not prepared to declare or pull that trigger because we still are in fact seeing growth in our end markets. But rest assured, we have plans, we have contingencies built in, and in the event that we ended up experiencing an economic downturn, we think, once again, the company playbook that we laid out, if you recall back to our Investor Day event, we'd essentially use our strong balance sheet, our strong cash flow, we certainly would step up our share repurchases and so we think the company has a playbook that we've already laid out and quite frankly even communicated in terms of what we would do in the event of an economic slowdown or an industrial recession. Scott Davis : Thank you. Good luck, guys. Craig Arnold : Thank you. Yan Jin : Our next question from John Walsh with Credit Suisse. John Walsh : Hi. Good morning. Craig Arnold : Hi. John Walsh : Question around the Aerospace margins, obviously another very strong quarter taking the margins higher again, I think last quarter you alluded to some favorable mix, but just wanted to get your kind of thoughts around where the Aerospace margins are going to exit this year and kind of the sustainability of that? Craig Arnold : Yeah, I'd say that we got a really - got a number of different positive events that are taking place in Aerospace. Number one, I begin with once again our teams and how effectively they are executing, and we are just doing an outstanding job across that business and really converting on the opportunities in front of us and running our facilities very efficiently, and that's obviously giving us a bit of a margin lift. In addition to that, we're seeing today, quite frankly, as we talked about in prior years there simply are fewer big aerospace programs that we're spending R&D dollars on and that's obviously paying a dividend and I don't anticipate that changing dramatically unless the big OEs and commercial platforms will decide to launch some major new program, that's not currently on the horizon. And so that's obviously favorable for the business. And then the third element is, aftermarket continues to be quite strong. The aftermarket segment of the business continues to grow nicely and we're converting on margin upgrade opportunities. And so, we really do think that this business is going to be performing at much higher levels of profitability than it has historically, and if you think about the guidance that we provided for the year, you can expect the business to continue to perform in those levels. John Walsh : Thank you. And then I guess maybe just some color around the acquisition pipeline. I guess we've had now one deal strengthened on each side of the house, you're going to generate very strong free cash flow, you have a balance sheet, kind of what does the pipeline look like? And what's the appetite continuing to deploy it for M&A? Richard Fearon : Yes, I think maybe take the first question first. The pipeline, I'd say, the pipeline today is much more robust than it's been historically. Certainly, much more robust than we've seen in the last 3 years to 5 years. And so we are certainly looking. I'd say, at more opportunities than we ever have. Having said that, I will also point out though, valuations in many cases are still quite elevated, and we're going to continue to be disciplined as we think about how we deploy our capital and what we said and it continues to be the priorities that we'll continue to focus on largely our Electrical business, our Aerospace business and perhaps and certain opportunities around eMobility. Those continue to be the company's priorities in terms of how we think about deploying our M&A dollars. But, yeah, the pipeline is more robust today than it's been in quite some time. Craig Arnold : And I could just add - just add one thing. We've actually announced three transactions, Ulusoy and Electrical Intelligent Switchgear, a much smaller transaction, and then, this new Souriau transactions. And to Craig's point, the first two were at multiples of 7 times to 8 times EBITDA, and Souriau higher, but it will come down to levels close to that after we enact the integration program Yan Jin : Good. Our next question - our next question come from Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank. Nicole DeBlase : Yeah, thanks, good morning, guys. Craig Arnold : Hi. Nicole DeBlase : So maybe starting with the short cycle businesses, it's been clearly a pretty common theme this quarter end, we've heard from a lot of companies that things to decelerate a little bit in June and that's kind of continued into July. So just curious about anything you're willing to share on the monthly trends within the short cycle piece of your portfolio? Craig Arnold : I'd say that the call story is not terribly different than that. I'd say that the month of June really was weaker than what we were originally anticipating, and once again, your question, there's a lot going on in the global environment in the month of June, whether it's around trade and additional tariffs, or whether it's just around the general direction of the overall economy. And so, to what extent did a lot of our customers and distributors put things on pause in the month of June, we'll have to wait and see. I will say that, so far in the month of July, things are playing out largely as we anticipated and so very much consistent with the guidance that we provided. And so we don't think necessarily that June kind of is the new standard. But we did in fact see a slowdown in the month of June, very much consistent with what other companies have reported. Nicole DeBlase : Got it. That makes sense, Craig, thanks. And then for my follow-up just around data centers if you could provide a little bit more of an update of what you're seeing there? We've heard increased concerns about push-outs from the hyperscale players. So would love to hear what Eaton's seeing. Craig Arnold : Yeah. And I'd say that, for us, we always talk about data centers being kind of a long-term growth market where we think the market will in fact continue to grow within our long-term trend basis , high single-digits. And so we think it's a great space to be in and Eaton has a great strategic position in data centers both on the equipment side as well as on the power quality side, but there is this fairly large segment of the market called hyperscale that is very lumpy and it's been lumpy historically and probably will continue to be lumpy in the future. And if you just look back at what happened in our business in, let's say, in the first half of 2018, we got very large multi-year orders from a number of the data center hyperscale players. And as a result of that, we kind of anniversaried that in the first half of the year and we'll have a better second half comparable for sure, but that business is lumpy today, it will continue to be lumpy , but we think data centers long term, and quite frankly in the near term is a great space to be in and will continue to be a real growth engine for the company. Nicole DeBlase : Thanks, Craig. Yan Jin : Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Joe Ritchie : Thanks, good morning. Craig Arnold : Good morning, Joe. Joe Ritchie : So maybe just kind of taking that Aero margin question slightly differently. So obviously, the first half of the year, the margins were incredibly strong. If I take a look at your guidance for the full year, the implied guidance for the second half, would be that second half Aero margins are going to be lower than first half Aero margins. And so my question is, was there anything specific about the first half that really helped boost margins or anything that's potentially going to impact margins in the second half on the Aero side? Craig Arnold : Yeah, I think the simple answer to that question, I'd say is, no. I mean, we certainly outperformed our expectations in the first half of the year. We certainly saw very positive aftermarket mix in the first half of the year. Question, is that going to continue into the second half? At this point, I think it's tough to say. And so - and we have lifted margins overall, I think very much consistent with the business probably going back to historical view of OE aftermarket mix, but other than that, there were absolutely no one-time items or other things that drove the improvement in margins in the business outside of what I'd articulate, which is largely strong execution in our businesses, strong aftermarket, and quite frankly, as I mentioned, lower R&D spending. Joe Ritchie : Got it. That makes sense, and good to hear there, Craig. I guess my follow-on question, and this is something I think I've asked you on prior calls, is really just around Hydraulics and how you're thinking about that business longer term? You've taken down the margin guidance, it's now below the longer-term thresholds for that business. And I guess just how are you - how are you thinking about the - I guess the trajectory of this business as part of the portfolio, just given the performance that we've seen recently? Craig Arnold : I appreciate the question. It's clearly - it's a business today that we're not pleased with the way the business is performing. We're not pleased with the way we've converted on the opportunity that's in front of us. The margins are in fact below the overall guidance for the Company. Yeah, I will say that today, Hydraulics accounts for 8% of our Company. We delivered 17.9% all-time record margins, despite the fact that we have one of our businesses that's not today firing on all cylinders, and I really look at that as saying, wow, what an opportunity for what this company will look like once we get Hydraulics performing at the level that we know that they're capable of. And so I'd say that as we think about the first half of the year, we were still working through some repositioning costs, we were still working through some inefficiencies, as I mentioned, they will have a better second half of the year. We're very much confident in the plan that the team laid out in front of us, but we have work to do and we have something to prove still in our Hydraulics business. But I'd say for us at the end of the day, it's in a company as large and as diverse as Eaton, it's unusual to find every single business firing on all cylinders. It's really I think a testament to the strength of company that despite the fact that you can have one of the cylinders not firing completely that the company can still deliver record all-time margins across the board. So I think a real testament to the strength of franchise. Joe Ritchie : Fair enough. Thank you. Yan Jin : Our next question comes from Dave Raso with Evercore. Dave Raso : There was some concern going into the quarter on ESS orders and the organic for the second half, but obviously your comments about ex-hyperscale that your orders didn't even slow on a year-over-year basis, and the rest of the year, you're implying organic for that business as strong as you saw in the first quarter. So it seems like you're very comfortable with the top line. Can you help us a bit with the margin in the back half of the year, like what's in the backlog when it comes to mix, any price cost you can help us with, I see the incremental in the back half of the year is about 36%. It's actually a little lower than the first half. So it doesn't seem that challenging, but can you just help us a bit with what's in the backlog to gain comfort with that in an important business? Craig Arnold : Yeah, what I would say in general is that our backlog is very much reflective of what we experienced in the first half of the year and clearly the guidance that we provided Incorporated what we have visibility to into our backlog, and so I'd say, once again, in our Electrical Systems & Services business very much like some of the other parts of the company, that the team is just executing well on the opportunity in front of us. And I'd say, if you think about price versus cost, what we've always said, which is largely kind of still our point of view is that it will be kind of a net neutral to us. Clearly, we're getting price in places where we're dealing with inflation, in places where we're dealing with tariff-derived cost increases, and as a result, our businesses are managing that very effectively. So we think that's going to be a net neutral, and essentially the margin expansion will really come from our ability to really manage the portfolio in terms of where we choose to compete, it will come from our ability to continue to bring out inefficiencies inside of our businesses. Dave Raso : So nothing unique in the backlog help or hurt on the margin from what we've seen? Craig Arnold : No very much consistent with what we've experienced in the first half. Dave Raso : That's great. Thank you very much. Yan Jin : Our next question comes from Ann Duignan with JPMorgan. Ann Duignan : Hi, good morning, everybody. Craig Arnold : Good morning, Ann. Ann Duignan : Yeah. A lot of my questions have been answered, but Craig, I think on Hydraulics you commented that you're seeing more broad-based slowdown in agriculture geographically. I think last part, you're saying just North America. Maybe you could just update us on that and what you're seeing more broadly? Craig Arnold : I think that's fair, and I'd say whether it's in ag markets and quite frankly even in construction equipment markets, I think we've seen a general slowdown really around the world in most of the mobile equipment markets, slowdown certainly in terms of the absolute rate of growth, we see that and some of the big OEMs we've already reported their numbers. But the other big thing that's taking place clearly across the  businesses is inventory correction that we're seeing both in OEM channel as well as in the distribution channel and probably largely in anticipation of a slowdown. And so we were really dealing with both of those factors right now inside of the business, but, so I'd say today, very much factored into our guidance, and one of the reasons why we lowered the revenue outlook for the Hydraulics business this year. Ann Duignan : Okay, I appreciate that. And then on Vehicle side, your outlook for NAFTA heavy-duty production is flat this year and the OEMs are all still quite upbeat about end market demand and we know where orders are, we know where backlogs are, but what are you hearing, feet on the street, that's making you more cautious than your OEM customers? Craig Arnold : Yeah, I'd say it's very possible in that the market can be stronger than what we're calling right now is that we know we're calling it flat and we do know there's others out there who are calling for some modest growth in North America Class 8 truck this year. So we'll have to see how that all plays out, but we just take a look at the general level of the economy overall, the fact that we are in fact seeing slowing, we are in fact seeing inventory levels today that are at elevated levels, and so we'll just have to wait until that one plays out. But to your point, there are a couple of others out there who have more robust forecast for North America Class 8 truck than we have. Ann Duignan : Okay. So it's more erring on the side of caution rather than anything you're hearing specifically? Craig Arnold : Yeah, absolutely. I think it's really more erring on the side of caution recognizing that in the event of a general slowdown in the economy, as you know better than most, and that businesses tend to do move quite quickly and so we think this erring on the side of caution is probably a prudent place to be. And keep in mind, by the way, for us, just maybe it's a good point to make the point where so much of our revenue today, goes through the joint venture. And so one of the things that we really tried to do as a company is really de-risk Eaton from a standpoint of its exposure to North America Class 8 truck markets and so you'll see that volatility largely in the joint venture. But you'll see very little of that volatility in our own results. And so I think that's an important point to emphasize, it was a deliberate part of our strategy. And so you'll see that largely in the JV, you'll see very little of that -- you'll see some of it, but you won't see a lot of that show up in Eaton's results. Ann Duignan : Okay. So the margin reduction in vehicle was primarily auto-related? Craig Arnold : Yeah. that's where we're seeing the weakening, by the way, we held the margins, by the way, just to be in there - as a point of clarification, we actually held the margin guidance, we narrowed the range. Ann Duignan : You narrowed that, yeah. Craig Arnold : But we held them - we held the midpoint in Vehicle and once again we held the midpoint, despite the fact that we're seeing a slowdown in our automotive markets around the world and that is largely the reason why we reduced the revenue guidance, but the fact that we held margins really once again goes back to our teams and our ability to execute in a declining revenue environment. Ann Duignan : Okay. Third point I'll leave it there. Thank you. Yan Jin : Our next question come from Deane Dray with RBC. Deane Dray : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Craig Arnold : Good morning, Deane. Deane Dray : Hey, I'd like to go back to the Souriau deal if we could. And Craig, since this is the largest deal you've done since becoming CEO, some color in terms of how did the deal come together? The structure is a bit unusual; maybe you can comment on that. And then whether there is an opportunity in that funnel to do larger deals like this? Craig Arnold : Yeah, Deane, I am not sure specifically in terms of the structure being unusual. I think it's a pretty straightforward - there are some unique rules with respect to the way deals are announced in France in terms of the unions having to approve transactions and maybe that's what you're referring to in terms\u2026 Deane Dray : Exactly. Craig Arnold : Okay, in the announcement, but we think that's largely a matter of form over function and we think the deal will close in good stead and we think it will close by the end of the year, no later than, and we don't think there's anything other than that that's unusual about the deal. And as I said, strategically, we really love this deal, I mean it's a -- if you think about the whole world becoming more electric including aircraft, if you think about Eaton being a big electrical company, we think we have a great opportunity to take their technology and their products into so many different applications in our core electrical business. And quite frankly in everything that we do as the world becomes more electric, we think the electrical connectors that Souriau manufacturers really gives us a great growth platform inside of the organization. And so I think what you're going to find from us is that we'll continue to look for opportunities in Aerospace, we like the business for a lot of reasons, and you'll continue to see us do more stuff in Electrical, this just happens to be one that really cuts across two of our big growth platforms, both Aerospace and Electrical and so it's very unique in that respect. But other than that, I think it's a deal that's really write down Main Street, we think we bought it at a very reasonable multiple for an Aerospace asset and we think it really provides once again a real lever for growth in the future. Deane Dray : And then just I had also asked whether that's maybe emboldens you to do bigger deals? Craig Arnold : Yeah, actually bigger deals for us is really a function of where the opportunities lie and whether or not you can acquire them with the right kind of financial returns and so we absolutely would not shy away from nor we ever shied away from strategic acquisition of scale where we feel like we can buy it at the right price and add significant shareholder value. And so I would say that the deal doesn't embolden us to do bigger deals, but then again, there is nothing that prevents us from taking a bigger swing if the asset is strategically important, and we feel like we can add value. Deane Dray : Got it. And then just the follow-up question on Lighting, and the extent to which you can comment on this. There was some discussion that you would entertain bids for the company as opposed to a spin. What has been the interest along those lines, and any color there would be appreciated. Craig Arnold : We are in discussions with multiple parties and we'll see how that plays out, Deane. We'll obviously take the course of action that is value maximizing for Eaton shareholders. Deane Dray : Terrific. Thank you. Yan Jin : Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Nigel Coe : Thanks guys, good morning. So the channel corrections in Electrical is a bit of a new development. And I think Lighting was an area where we expected to see it and obviously one of your competitors called out commercial as an area where there is a little bit of headwinds. So maybe just dig into that and maybe just address the extent to which you think this is caused by the price increases and tariffs as opposed to just general end market weakness and the normal kind of the de-stocking activity? Any color there would be very helpful? Craig Arnold : Yeah, I wish, quite frankly, Nigel, we had clear and more definitive answers for you in terms of what actually caused the slowdown. I think the truth of the matter is we and many others are speculating in terms of what actually caused that. But we clearly -- and there's a lot of geopolitical uncertainty in the world right now. And I'd say that it probably reached a high point in the month, certainly the early couple of weeks in June around trade disputes between the US and China and Mexico and some of the other just general weakness that we're seeing in some of the macros. And so I just think that there was enough out there in the month of June for people to pause and just take stock of exactly where we were at, but beyond that, we would really be out on a limb trying to speculate exactly what caused the slowdown. I will say that as we take a look at the back half of the year and we obviously factored in what we saw in the month of June into our outward forecasts for our businesses. And so I think this thing can go either way. I think we could probably just a higher probability that you're going to see a return to growth -- the normalized growth as you're probably going to see a deceleration, and at the end of the day, we're going to be ready. Our businesses and we're focusing on making sure that we have contingency plans in place. So in event that we end up in an economic slowdown that's more severe than what we're currently forecasting, our teams will be ready to flex our costs, to flex our spending to take whatever actions that we need to take to ensure that we continue to maximize performance. Nigel Coe : Thanks, Craig. And then another one on tariffs. As you know, Electrical Products and Lighting, it's one of the biggest categories of imports from China into the US, and obviously, you feel the inflation on some of the componentry but also your competitors who import from there obviously facing some tougher barriers there. So I'm just wondering how the tariffs have impacted the competitive environments in both the Low Voltage, but also in as Lighting as well? Craig Arnold : Yeah, I\u2019d say on the logo really very minimal today as we talked about it pre-event, we said that tariffs will be order of magnitude about $100 million bill for the company, and that's largely unchanged from what we forecasted the last time, and that doesn't necessarily have a - an outsized impact on our Low Voltage business at all. It does, to your point, have an outsized impact on Lighting, but I will tell you that, good news is that, we and others in the industry, have passed on tariffs, and at this point, we don't feel like the tariff issue today is in anyway negatively impacting the margins of the business. And quite frankly, we had a fairly good quarter in Lighting both in growth and in orders. And so we're very comfortable with our Lighting business in the way our team is executing and managing the tariff impacts as it relates to their business. Nigel Coe : Yeah, thanks for that Craig. The question is more on the competitive impact, but we can take it offline, thanks a lot. Yan Jin : Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Okay, then we take next one from Steve Volkmann with Jefferies. Steve Volkmann : Great. I'm here. Craig Arnold : Hi, good. Steve Volkmann : Just a couple of quick cleanups, I guess if I may. I was curious about the price cost question from a different perspective. We're starting to hear a little bit of signs of people sort of pushing back on price increases due to slower growth, due to lower material costs, and I'm just curious what your view of sort of price cost is over the next couple of quarters? Craig Arnold : And I think our point of view, Steve, is really largely where we've always been, and so we always think about price cost in the near term as neither being a headwind nor a tailwind for the business and we try to manage it to be neutral. That's kind of been our position as we laid out our thinking for the year and that's really where we're still parked. In some cases, there is very formulate equations that drive what we're able to pass on to our customers and where prices go up and down as a function of a basket of commodities, and other cases , it's a function of, obviously what's in the backlog and what you've negotiated. But as we think about the go-forward view you know I'd say today it's still our view is net neutral that pricing cost for 2019 will neither be a positive nor negative for the Company. Steve Volkmann : Okay, great. Thank you. And then, sorry if I missed this, but any update on the fluid conveyance divestiture. Richard Fearon : Yeah that's proceeding as well and we are hopeful that it would close towards the end of the third quarter, perhaps the beginning of the fourth quarter. Steve Volkmann : Great, thank you guys. Yan Jin : Our next question comes from Rob McCarthy with Stephens. Rob McCarthy : Can you hear me guys? Craig Arnold : Yes Rob McCarthy : So I'll -- let me go ahead. The first question I would have is in the context of what you're seeing now, which is kind of a choppy challenging conditions overall, could you just frame how you think about kind of what your trough earnings could be if this is the peak this year? Is there any way you could attempt to answer that qualitatively or otherwise, Craig? Craig Arnold : Yeah, and we tried to address this one a little bit, Rob, when we called everybody together for our Investor Day earlier this year. And one of the things we talked about is the fact that, as we think about Eaton in our new configuration and -- our new configuration would include obviously once we divest Lighting, once we get rid of FCD [ph] and given the fact that we generate such strong free cash flow. We said what we're working on doing is standing up a company that even during a typical economic recession defined as two quarters or three quarters of GDP contraction that our company would be able to still maintain flat earnings during that period of time. And so that's still the path that we're on and that's what our teams are working on doing and I think you see a lot of evidence today in our businesses, using Vehicle an example, despite the fact that clearly revenues are down pretty significantly, we're holding margins. And so that's really the goal, and then because we do generate so much free cash flow that it will give us the ability in the event of an economic downturn to buy back more stock. And so that's really the formula that we continue to work towards, and what we would intend to do in the event of an economic downturn. Rob McCarthy : That makes sense. And then, forgive me for this other question, It's a little impolitic. But in terms of your new announcements of the sector heads, obviously, Uday and Heath are very well regarded internally and externally and from all channel checks. But the one thing I do get in terms of the feedback anonymously was the fact that as good as Heath is, he's never run anything explicitly from -- at a segment level, I mean, do you think is up to this, I mean obviously you think he is up to the challenge. But how do you think about that going forward or is that a risk to management or execution for Eaton? Craig Arnold : Sure. I certainly appreciate the question. I will tell you the first thing I'd say is that Heath is an outstanding leader who has been around for a long time inside of Eaton and inside Cooper before that, and just an outstanding leader with outstanding judgment, outstanding decision making. And if you think about today the way we're organized, Rob, today, we have really three businesses, right? And inside of these businesses, we have presidents who really run the day-to-day who are great operators, who know how to execute. And what we're really looking for in this sector job is really strategic thought leadership and Heath, by the way, has had [indiscernible] as does Uday, And so I would tell you that he is exactly what we need for the business at this point in time, the business is going through in all three cases a fair amount of the strategic repositioning with a lot of moving parts and pieces in all three businesses as we talked about and what really our businesses need is a partner somebody can work with them on, how do you think about the future of these businesses and what strategic moves should we be making to maximize our results and our performance and with really three strong operating guys, it made no sense to put four in the box and put somebody else with exactly the same background into those businesses and Heath will bring exactly what we need for those businesses, which is really strategic thought leadership. Rob McCarthy : Thanks for taking my questions. Operator : Good. [indiscernible] question from Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Andrew Obin : Hey, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. Just a question on, first on China, could you describe in more details what the trend has been through the quarter because it appears that something happened in June and I wonder if you've seen a slowdown in June? And if you could just describe the intra-quarter trend in China? Thank you. Craig Arnold : Yeah, I can't say that we saw anything specific at all. Andrew, in the month of June, I think what we've generally reported, is that in the -- certainly in the short cycle businesses, specifically in automotive in Vehicle markets, we clearly saw a weak quarter. We saw a little bit of a weaker quarter in Hydraulics for sure in China. The long cycle businesses, non-res construction, residential construction continue to be strong during the quarter. And so I'd say this kind of bifurcation of these two different markets depending upon where you sit, that's kind of been a pattern that we've seen out of China for most of this year and in Q2, and the month of June wasn't really much different than that. We are optimistic that with some of the infrastructure-related spending, that's -- and the stimulus initiatives that have been put into the China market, we could have a better second half of the year, but at this point, we really didn't see anything significantly different in China that was unlike the pattern that we've really experienced all year. Andrew Obin : And I apologize if I missed the question. Could you just comment on the growth rate within ES&S? What's the growth rate for Services, what was that in the quarter? And what are the big trends there? Craig Arnold : Yeah. As I mentioned, as I was walking through the businesses, we really had a really strong quarter of orders in our Electrical Systems & Services business, up strongly in the US some 15%, Europe was up also close to 15%. So, Services really was one of the standout performers for orders during the course of the second quarter and so we continue to be optimistic about the outlook for Services overall. Andrew Obin : Terrific, thanks for fitting me in. Yan Jin : Good. Thank you all. We have reached the end of our call, and we appreciate everybody's questions. As always, Craig and I will be available to address any follow-up questions. Thank you for joining us today. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the presentation for this morning. Again, we thank you very much for all your participation and using our Executive Teleconference Service. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] I will turn the call now over to the Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Yan Jin. Please go ahead sir. Yan Jin : Good morning. I am Yan Jin, Eaton\u2019s Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you all for joining us for the Eaton third quarter 2019 earnings call. With me today are Craig Arnold, our Chairman and CEO and Rick Fearon, Vice Chairman, Chief Financial and Planning Officer. Our agenda today including opening remarks by Craig highlighting the company\u2019s performance in the third quarter. As we have done in our past calls, we will be taking questions at the end of the Craig\u2019s comments. The press release from our earnings announcement this morning and the presentation we will go through today have been posted on our website at www.eaton.com. Please note that both the press release and the presentation, includes reconciliations to the non-GAAP measures. A webcast of this call is accessible on our website and it will be available for replay. Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our comments today including statements related to the expected future results of the company and are therefore forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our forecasted projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and the presentation. They are also outlined in our related 8-K filing. With that, I will turn it over to Craig. Craig Arnold : Thanks, Yan. Appreciate it. And we will start on Page 3 with a highlight of our Q3 results. And overall, I would characterize this quarter\u2019s results as really strong earnings results and strong cash flow despite weaker end markets. Earnings per share as you saw in the press release were $1.44 on GAAP basis, a $1.52 excluding transaction costs and acquisition and divestiture in excess of our businesses, $1.52, our results were 6% above last year, excluding the 2018 arbitration decision and within our guidance range of $1.50 to $1.60. However, sales were certainly lower than what we expected, down 1% organically, negative currency impacting us by 1.5 points and acquisitions adding 0.5 point to our results. We continue to deliver strong margin performance with another record and all-time earnings on margins. Segment operating margins of 18.7% for an all-time record for Eaton and this includes records for electrical products, for electrical systems and services, and for aerospace. These margins were also above the high-end of our guidance and 110 basis points above last year. We continue to generate very strong operating cash flows of $1.1 billion, up 8% over Q3 2018, an another quarterly record. Lastly with summarizing results where we purchased 539 million shares in the quarter bringing our year-to-date purchases to $949 million or 2.8% of our shares outstanding at the beginning of the year. Turning to Page 4, we show a summary of our Q3 performance versus prior year and I will just point out a few highlights here. First, we delivered $41 million of increase in segment operating profits despite a 1% decline in organic revenue and this was really driven by strong execution, effective cost control and favorable mix in a couple of our businesses. Second, we incurred $0.08 per share of after-tax cost primarily related to the planned divestiture of our lighting business. And lastly, adjusted EPS increased 6% excluding the 2018 arbitration decision. These results I would say are consistent with our boarder message on how we intend to run the company doing periods of market weakness, with strong execution, proactive cost control and increasing our share repurchases. On Page 5, we show our quarterly results for our Electrical Products segment. Overall revenues were flat made up of 1% organic growth offset by 1% negative currency. We saw revenue strength in both commercial and residential markets in North America partially offset by softness in industrial controls globally. Segment operating profits increased 6% and operating margins were up 110 basis points to 20.3%, which was an all-time record for the segment. We also announced the sale of our lighting business to signify for a price of $1.4 billion and we have seen a good outcome for our shareholders and another example of how we are actively managing the portfolio to create higher margin and higher growth set of businesses for Eaton. This was a decision that was also good for our employees who will now be part of a larger and more focused lighting company. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2020 and I would say for our core products business which now excludes the lighting, orders were up 1% led by strength in residential and commercial construction largely once again in the Americas. Moving to Page 6, we summarize our results for our Electrical Systems and Services segment. Revenues increased 3%, 3% organic growth. We also had a 1.5% growth from the acquisitions of Ulusoy and Innovative Switchgear Solutions and a 1.5% of negative currency. Organic growth here was driven by strength in data centers, commercial construction and actually also in engineering services. Our ES&S business also produced all-time record margins of 18.3%, which were up 290 basis points from prior year, operating profits increasing some 23% on 3% organic growth. This business benefited from higher sales for sure, but also had very good operational execution in conversion. And on a rolling 12-month basis, ES&S orders were up 5% with growth really across I would say all regions here. And if you exclude hyperscale data centers, the 12-month rolling average of our orders was up 8% which was really in line with what we saw in Q2. So once again, a long cycle business very much performing at very high levels. On the next page, we show our results for Hydraulics for Q3. Revenues were down 10% with an 8% decline in organic revenues and 2% negative currency. Organic revenue declines were driven primarily by weakness in global mobile equipment markets and in quite frankly de-stocking that we have seen both at the OEM level and also within distribution. Segment operating margins were 11.9%, down 290 basis from last year but I think on a sequential basis, margins were actually up 40 basis points despite seasonally lower Q3 revenues that came in about $100 million below Q2. And our order declined to 14% really as a result of continued weakness, as we mentioned in global mobile equipment markets around the world. Turning to Page 8, we summarized our quarterly results for Aerospace segment. Once again, this business posted very strong results with record top line and bottom line performance. Revenues increased 7% with 8% organic growth and 1% negative currency. Orders on a rolling 12-month basis increased 13% with particular strength in the military market, specifically for fighters, for watercraft and also aftermarket. We also saw strength on the commercial side in business jets. We continue to demonstrate strong incremental margins with nearly 60% growth in margins on organic revenues which drove over 23% increase in operating profits and a 310 basis point improvement in our margins. And as you recall, we announced the acquisition of Souriau-Sunbank in July and we expect this transaction to close before the end of the year, so all things are good in aerospace. On the next page, we summarize our Q3 results for the Vehicle segment. Our revenues were down 13% which includes a 12% decline in organic revenues and a negative 1% impact from currency. The organic sales decline was due to a combination of global weakness in light vehicle markets which we think were down approximately 4% in the quarter and primarily the impact of the transfer revenues into the Eaton Cummins joint venture. For 2019, the NAFTA Class 8 market remains solid. We expect production to be roughly 340,000 units this year and up 5% for 2018. We do however expect global light vehicle market to be down some 4% for the year. Despite lower organic revenues and volume, operating margins continue to run at very high level at 18.3%, margins were down only 60 basis points from last year. So our vehicle team once again did a nice job of flexing spending which allow them to deliver detrimental margins of approximately 25%. Moving to Page 10, we show our eMobility results for Q3. Revenues were down 1% with flat organic revenues and negative 1% from currency. Flat organic revenues in this case of due primarily to a mix of platforms that we\u2019re on, I\u2019d ask you to keep in mind that in this business is really made up of a mix of the new electric and hybrid platforms plus the legacy electrical content that we have on internal combustion engines. Once again, we increased our R&D spending which was really the primary reason why operating margins declined 740 basis points to 5.1%, but we continue to pursue a large number of additional electric and hybrid programs here and we are very pleased with the progress that we are making to-date. Next on Page 10, we summarized our outlook for 2019. We now expect organic revenue growth of approximately 1% and as you know this is down from our prior estimate of approximately 3% and this is really based upon reduced global growth, particularly in our short cycle businesses but also includes some slow growth in non-res construction as well, still growth but slower growth which has impacted our electrical business. Within electrical, we now expect full-year organic growth of approximately 2.5% for electrical products and 4.5% for electrical systems and services. Hydraulics global mobile equipment markets remain weak and this weakness is being amplified, but really de-stocking in both the OEM and distribution channel. As a result, we now expect organic revenues to decline by approximately 4.5%. Aerospace remained strong across the board and we\u2019re reaffirming the midpoint of our full year growth estimate of 9.5%. In Vehicle, global automotive markets remain weak so we\u2019re reducing our organic revenue estimates to be down approximately 10% for the year. And we\u2019ve also slightly modified our estimates for e-mobility as well which we think will be growth of 4% at the midpoint of 2019. Overall, our long cycle businesses within ES&S and aerospace are expected to continue to deliver attractive organic growth rates for the year, while we project low single-digit growth for electrical products overall. Business conditions have clearly been impacted by trade, by the political environment and a number of one-off events that have weakened our second half outlook, maybe as a kind of confidence as we look to the future, we would say, what the fundamentals of the economy still solid, low interest rates. High employment, strong consumer confidence and we hope that is pulled back would be short-lived but we have to wait and see. Moving to Page 12, we show our margin expectations for the year and I think based upon the strong Q3 margins we are increasing our consolidated segment operating profit margin guidance 20 basis points to a new range of 17.3% to 17.7% or 17.5% at the midpoint and this includes increasing margins for three of our six segments, Electrical Products up by 30 basis points, Electrical Systems and services up by 50 basis points and Aerospace up by 120 basis points. And due to expected volume declines we are lowering margins in two of our segments : hydraulics by 110 basis points and vehicle by 40 basis points. With this updated guidance, I would say that we are really on track to deliver another record year of margins with a strong 70 basis point increase at the midpoint over 2018 despite lower revenues can we anticipated. And finally turning to Page 13, we show our guidance for Q4 in 2019. For Q4, we expect adjusted earnings per share of $1.36 to $1.46, other assumptions for Q4 in our guidance include, we think our organic revenues will decline by approximately 2%, we would expect segment margins of 17.2% to 17.6%, flat corporate expenses of two last year and an adjusted earnings tax rate of approximately 17% we are slightly lowering the midpoint of our full year 2019 adjusted earnings per share guidance to $5.72, $0.09 below the current consensus and due to lower market conditions. This does still represent a 6% increase over 2018 when you exclude the impact of the arbitration decisions. We are also increasing our operating cash flow guidance by an another $100 million as you recall that we increased it by $200 million so far through this point and we now expect to deliver $3.4 billion to $3.6 billion for the year, because I mentioned the second time that we will increase our operating cash flow guidance which highlight really the strong cash flow generation capability of our businesses. For 2019, our free cash flow to adjusted earnings conversion is expected to be over 120%, while free cash flow to sales is estimated to reach approximately 14%. Other full year guidance assumptions include 1% organic growth, a $100 million of revenue from the acquisitions of Ulusoy and Innovative Switchgear Solutions, foreign exchange impact of a negative $350 million and this is actually $50 million worse than our prior guidance, segment margins in the range of 17.3% to 17.7%, up 20 basis points at the midpoint. No change in our tax rate, we think our CapEx spending this year will be roughly $550 million and this is about $50 million lower than prior guidance and we estimate for our share purchases to be increased to roughly $1 billion and this is up from our prior guidance of $800 million as we continue to deploy our strong free cash flow. So overall, we are very pleased with the company\u2019s performance this year. We are delivering very strong cash flow, solid EPS growth despite what turned out to be a much weaker economic environment for many of our end markets. So I will stop with that and turn it back over to Yan for Q&A. Yan Jin : Thanks, Craig. Before we begin the Q&A session for our call today, I do see we have a lot of individuals have interested in the queue with questions. Given the time constraint of one hour today and our desire to go to as many of the questions as possible, please limit your opportunity to just to one question and a follow-up. And I will thank you in the advance for your cooperation. With that, I will turn it over to the operator to give you guys the instructions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Okay. We will take the first question from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Nigel Coe : Thanks. Good morning. Craig Arnold : Good morning, Nigel. Nigel Coe : Obviously lot of good detail on the call, you did a great job of adjusting to the trending conditions in 3Q showed us a very nice margin, you are assuming margin step down a bit more than normal seasonality in the 4Q. I\u2019m just wondering what\u2019s driving that Craig I recon, is there any additional restructuring coming through in 4Q and where we stand on additional restructuring actions in lights of that weaker volumes? Yan Jin : I appreciate the question, Nigel. I mean to your statement, absolutely, if you think about kind of the bridge between Q3 and Q2, we\u2019re really outstanding performance in Q3 there were number of items that were impacting us in Q3 and Q4 that are taking the margins down, one is a higher level of restructuring and you could imagine, it\u2019s largely in those businesses where we\u2019re seeing additional market weakness. We certainly are seeing a higher tax rate in Q4 than we had in Q3 if you saw the operational tax rate of roughly 17%. In addition to that there is a few normal factors, healthcare cost tend to run higher in Q4 than in prior quarters. And so this is a number of, one-time items that we are dealing with in Q4. Obviously, we dealing with the GM strike that a little bit of an impact as well in Q4 that take the margins down, but I\u2019d say that as you think about the outlook for 2020, I feel a lot of these are one-time items and I know that a number of the analysts wrote about extrapolating Q4 into next year, I guess I just ask you to keep in mind that there are a number of one-time and seasonal items that are impacting Q4 that you really would not be justified and extrapolating for the full year. Nigel Coe : That\u2019s great color. We will dig into the details offline but I do want to switch to ESS margins and we probably 2 years ago thinking 15% and this business will be a dream and here at 18%. So I am just curious how confident we feel that you can defend this level of margin going forward and maybe just address what\u2019s changed to drive such a high margin? Craig Arnold : Once again we agree, 18% is outstanding performance by our team in general. And as I mentioned in my commentary, it is a function of really strong execution by the organization on higher volumes that we saw in the quarter and we will clearly need to revisit the long-term margin guidance for our ES&S segment. If you recall, we talked about this segment performing at 13% to 16% through the cycle, we\u2019re already performing well above those numbers and so as we think about giving the outlook for the business and setting expectations, we do believe that this business will perform at higher levels on a go-forward basis. Nigel Coe : Thanks, Craig. Yan Jin : Okay, good. Our next question comes from Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc. Jeff Hammond : Good morning, guys. Craig Arnold : Good morning, Jeff. Jeff Hammond : If you can just talk about kind of where we stand in the de-stocking for Hydraulics? And then just are you seeing any de-stocking in electrical and maybe just speak through where in the guide you are seeing softness within, I guess particularly EPG? Craig Arnold : Yes. I think in terms of Hydraulics, as we talked about on our commentary, we have seen broad-based de-stocking significant, let\u2019s say, de-stocking at the OEM channel as productions continues to run well below retail sales and you see that in a lot of the public data in also in distribution we are seeing the same thing. I think the question becomes how long does this go on and that we could sit here and attempt to speculate when does the de-stocking and it\u2019s really going to be a function of what ultimately happens with the end-markets and it\u2019s indicated in the end-market demand. I will say that today we take a little confidence in the fact that the end market demand in many of these hydraulic markets around the world are certainly performing okay. We are talking about, let\u2019s say, on average low single-digit growth in a market like construction flat to slightly down in markets like ag, but what we are experiencing as a supplier is our numbers at a much worse than that. So we take some confidence in that that we are approaching the end, but I think ultimately it will really be a function of what\u2019s going to happen with these end markets in terms of de-stocking in hydraulics business. I would say in the electrical business more broadly, at this point we are not really seeing significant de-stocking in electrical and what kind of impacted our growth a little bit in electrical in the quarter was largely project delays given the kind of the uncertain political environment that we are living in right now. It\u2019s been really more of that issue than it\u2019s been an issue of de-stocking. And certainly if you think about our Electrical Products business much of which goes through distribution in periods of uncertainty, they are kind of being cautious around the inventory levels that they are putting on the shelf in general, but not at this point I would say a significant amount of de-stocking. Jeff Hammond : Okay, great. And then Craig I think in past years you provide kind of initial views on out-year in third quarter and I didn\u2019t see anything in there? Anything you can give on kind of how you are thinking about the markets, incrementals and non-operating items and kind of uses of cash around the lighting sales? Thanks. Craig Arnold : Yes, Jeff, your observation is absolutely accurate, Jeff. We would typically in this call give kind of some insight into 2020 given the level of uncertainty in the environment that we are currently dealing with whether it\u2019s trade or geopolitical or some of these one-off customer events. We thought it would be prudent at this juncture not to provide guidance for 2020 some of the Q4 play through and that we would then be providing guidance as a part of our earnings call in January. And so that\u2019s kind of the way we are thinking about that. The specific question around uses of cash, obviously we sold the lighting business \u2013 we will sell the lighting business for $1.4 billion and it would be our intention to use those proceeds to buyback shares. We are going to attempt to be smart and strategic in the timing of the buyback program, but the intention would be to use those proceeds plus our very strong cash flow generating capabilities to make sure that we fully offset any dilution associated with the divestiture of lighting. Jeff Hammond : Okay. Thanks, Craig. Operator : Our next question comes from Dave Raso with Evercore. Dave Raso : Good morning. Apologize, I missed the very beginning of the call, but for the electrical businesses exiting 2019 into \u201820, the lighting business is still officially in the guide for fourth quarter for EP, correct, just to be clear? Craig Arnold : Yes, yes. Dave Raso : Okay. So, the orders were up 1% ex-lighting for ET and in ES&S orders. I\u2019d say overall we\u2019re probably a little better than people feared but can you help us understand, what you\u2019re seeing beyond the quarter in the sense of, what\u2019s in the back half, further visibility, short the normal, just trying to get a sense of Electrical start the year healthy because obviously people are wondering can we get the more cyclical businesses bottoming out at some point in the first half and hope they are all growing together in the end of the year? Craig Arnold : I appreciate the question, Dave. The business that obviously we have the greatest visibility within our Electrical Systems and Services business and I will say that our order input in Q3 was quite strong across the board. Most of the end markets that we serve, I\u2019d say posted anywhere from mid to high single-digit order growth in the quarter which really bodes well I\u2019d say for the long cycle piece of our business with Electrical Systems and Services into 2020, I think it\u2019s too early to make a call on it and that\u2019s one of the reasons why we are not providing guidance, but certainly if we take a look at the order book and what happened during the course of Q3 in Electrical Systems and Services, we feel very good about the order intake and how the 2020 is shaping up and Electrical Products which tend to be much more of a book-and-bill business and as we mentioned, we did see a little bit of conservatism on the part of distribution, and in that business it just doesn\u2019t tend to be a longer cycle business and so we\u2019ll just have to see what happens with some of these other kind of world events and what level of distribution confidence we\u2019re taking in with us into 2020. Dave Raso : And the ex-Lighting in the fourth quarter or I should say it another way is lighting down in the fourth quarter, so I assume that will be out of the business when we give the guide in January [indiscernible] core business? Craig Arnold : What I\u2019d say is I appreciate the question, Dave, given the fact that we have entered into a transaction we signed, we prefer not to comment on lighting as it\u2019s going to ultimately be somebody else\u2019s business on a go-forward basis. And so as we think about lighting on a go-forward basis and we would prefer not to comment on that business given the transactions and the fact that ultimately somebody else is going to own it. Dave Raso : I can appreciate that. Okay, thank you. Yan Jin : Our next question comes from Scott Davis with Melius. Scott Davis : Hi. Good morning guys. Yan Jin : Hi. Scott Davis : Craig, just to kind of address the elephant in the room when you have quarters like this, where you missed your guidance on the top line which doesn\u2019t happen to this extreme very often, does it make you kind of rethink the portfolio a little bit? I mean you got Hydraulics and vehicle that will actually goes around every cycle and is it worth the headaches? I mean I\u2019ll just leave it at that. Craig Arnold : I appreciate the question, Scott. And as we have talked on this call before we would like to I\u2019d say laid out our criteria for businesses that we like and the conditions under which we think we are going to stay in business and the conditions in which we\u2019re going to step out and I will say that if you take a look at our track record over time Eaton has done a lot of work around the portfolio and the lighting divestiture is the latest example of that. At the end of the day, you think about today hydraulics and the quarter delivered 7% of our company profit facility, at the end of the day whether Hydraulics grows 5% or shrinks 5%, it really doesn\u2019t have a significant impact on the ultimate earnings of our company. So we like to think that we\u2019re getting some of the execution issues behind us and it is a cyclical business, it will always be a cyclical business, but at the end of the day what really drives Eaton, as we said on the earnings call 80% of our earnings come from electrical systems and services electrical products in aerospace and that\u2019s really what drives the company. And we will continue to work on our internal plans to improve the execution of Hydraulics, they know what they need to do in order to continue to deliver and be a value creating part of the company. So I would say at this point we are comfortable with the portfolio and at the end of day will continue to focus on the things that we can control and side of the business, recognizing it these will always be cyclical businesses. Scott Davis : Fair enough, Craig. And just as a follow-up, I mean I know you mentioned that you have got this billion dollars coming in and you are going to do more buybacks, but is this types of environment or you want to take another more aggressive look at M&A or is this the type of environment or it\u2019s so uncertain that it\u2019s better to push it to the right there? Craig Arnold : We always look at the trade-off. We have been very disciplined over the years around in terms of understanding what our cost of capital is and we think it\u2019s roughly 8% to 9%, and we would expect the return order of magnitude to 200 to 300 basis points over, our cost of capital as a minimum. And so we have been very disciplined buyer through both at a low point in the economic cycle and we would continue to maintain that and that\u2019s the way we\u2019ll run the company. And so for us, it\u2019s always going to be a matter of trading off what an acquisition would do for the company in both strategically and in terms of EPS versus the option that we have of buying back shares at very attractive prices. Scott Davis : Okay, good enough. Thanks. Good luck, guys. Craig Arnold : Thank you. Yan Jin : Our next question comes from John Walsh with Credit Suisse. John Walsh : I wanted to go back to the Aerospace margins, obviously very strong. I know a couple of quarters ago, we had a conversation around OE versus aftermarket mix but similar to that ESS line of questioning, we are above kind of your through the cycle look on that business, how do you view the sustainability of those really strong Aerospace margins? Craig Arnold : I appreciate the question and I\u2019d say as I\u2019ve said on prior calls, this is really been a little bit of a Goldilocks period for the Aerospace industry overall because you have really strong market demand, you have a very strong aftermarket and you have relatively by historical standards low program spending. And so you\u2019re seeing the result of that deliver very strong margins but that is certainly another one of the segments that we\u2019re going to clearly have to take a look at as we provide once again our longer-term outlook for the business in terms of what margin should look like through the cycle. And clearly that\u2019s one that will be revisiting and will likely go up, given the levels of the business is performing at today. But I\u2019d say today when we think about whether or not 25% margins are pretty extraordinary and the business probably won\u2019t perform at that level every quarter but I will say that we\u2019re very comfortable today that the margins in this business will perform at very high levels and very attractive levels for some time to come and primarily because consumers are continuing to get on planes and that drives the aftermarket. The military business is really just kicking into gear right now and and Boeing and Airbus are sitting on very large backlog and so we think this business will be good for a very long time. John Walsh : Great, thank you for that. And then obviously there has been a lot of questions around capital allocation addition In the strong cash, it\u2019s going to be coming in the door. I know you don\u2019t want to get ahead of yourself for next year but you\u2019ve historically had this expectation to take down 1% to 2% of float next year. I mean, should we assume that the high end of, that\u2019s kind of where we should be base casing it? Richard Fearon : Yes, it\u2019s. Rick, I would think of it this way, Our expectation would be take down 1% to 2% float and then the proceeds from Lighting on top of that, so you\u2019ll end up with considerably more than 1% to 2%. John Walsh : Great, thank you for that. Craig Arnold : And this is an important point because one of the things that we committed to you and the investor community in general is that as we think about how we would manage the company during periods of market weakness is that we said that we would use our strong cash flow generation capabilities in our balance sheet to essentially buyback shares to help offset pressures in terms of EPS and that\u2019s clearly what we did in Q3. And you could expect that as we look into 2020 depending upon where markets end up, that will continue to kind of run the same play. John Walsh : Great thank you. Yan Jin : Our next question comes from Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank. Nicole DeBlase : Yes, Thanks. Good morning guys. And maybe just the first question around the increase in the operating cash flow guidance, I guess, key drivers of the that it looks like the receivables balance is down inventories up a little bit, so just trying to reconcile where that\u2019s coming from? Richard Fearon : You\u2019re right. Working capital was very strong. If you look at the combination of receivables and payables, the change from Q2 to Q3, you\u2019re just shy of $200 million and so we have done a good job all year at managing working capital, we expect that to continue into Q4 and already our initial thinking about next year would have further improvements as a variety of programs relating to for example correcting any billing inaccuracies that makes a big difference on receivables, but also in payables and making sure that we are paying our suppliers in a commercially reasonable time-frame and we believe we have further opportunities to improve both receivables and payables. Craig Arnold : And to your point, Nicole, inventory is actually are up slightly. When you\u2019re facing into an economic downturn, we typically take inventories out of the organization so we quite frankly have a big opportunity still on in front of us in terms of really reducing our overall inventory levels and so to Rick\u2019s point we would expect 2020 to be another year of very strong cash flow. Nicole DeBlase : Thanks, Craig. You actually just pre-answered my second question any thoughts on the monthly progression of organic growth throughout the quarter? Things are getting a lot worse for you guys in September and then I guess anything initial that you have to say on October relative to the guidance that you\u2019ve provided today for the fourth quarter? Craig Arnold : One of the thing that was out at the Investor Conference Nicole and Laguna, and it\u2019s been kind of indicated there that we have already seen really in the first couple of months of the quarter, some market weakness, which really I\u2019d say persisted throughout the quarter. So if I say no, not particularly, September wasn\u2019t particularly weaker month than the other two months in the quarter in terms of the progression and how it unfolds. And in terms of October, I\u2019d say, what we\u2019ve seen so far is largely consistent with the forecast that we have provided. Nicole DeBlase : Thanks. I will pass it on. Craig Arnold : Thank you. Yan Jin : Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Joe Ritchie : Thanks. Good morning guys. Craig Arnold : Good morning, Joe. Joe Ritchie : So, Craig, I wanted to touch on the just the disconnect between what you\u2019re seeing on the order growth side on ESS and what you\u2019re expecting from a growth perspective and you mentioned in your prepared comments project deferrals and so I\u2019d love to get a little bit more color on where you\u2019re actually seeing project deferrals and how that kind of plays out into 2020? Craig Arnold : Yes. And what you referred to as a disconnect I would say largely, if you think about the Electrical Systems and Services business, it does tend to be a longer cycle business. And probably the best proxy for what we would expect for that business in fourth quarter probably would have been orders that we have received in Q2 of 2019 and if you recall, we had a relatively weak order intake in Q2. So there is a time lag to that business but once again to your point, we did see very strong orders in Q3 and we think that does bode well for 2020. And so that\u2019s really the way I would think about that. And in the second half of your question was with regard to the\u2026 Joe Ritchie : Just basically, how that played out for 2020. And I guess if I were to kind of ask a clarifying question, are you seeing any cancellations in your orders at all or is it just, really just deferrals at this point. Craig Arnold : Mostly deferrals as it is always the odd ball cancellation that you would do it always see in these businesses but I\u2019d say nothing that\u2019s increased significantly. Mostly, it\u2019s really delays. Joe Ritchie : Okay. And then\u2026 Richard Fearon : That\u2019s particularly true on the larger industrial projects. Joe Ritchie : Okay, got it. Thanks, Rick. I guess my one follow-up and somebody asked this earlier, but I wanted to see if we can get some type of quantification. On the aero margins, what\u2019s the expectation for R&D stepping down both this year and then into 2020? Craig Arnold : I think with respect to R&D, we\u2019ve already seen the step down in R&D that\u2019s currently reflected in our businesses. And so today, I\u2019d say we\u2019re probably running with respect to R&D as a percentage of revenue, we are probably running right now at historically low levels, primarily a function once again of new platform development from our customers, both on the commercial and the military side and so I would not expect an additional step down in R&D spending. It\u2019s really already reflected in the businesses run rate today in our earnings today. Joe Ritchie : Okay, got it. Thank you, guys. Yan Jin : Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Jeff Sprague : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Craig Arnold : Good morning, Jeff. Jeff Sprague : Just a question on restructuring and I\u2019ll wrap it around lighting, a little bit, can you just elaborate a little bit on what you\u2019re doing on the restructuring front? Maybe help us think about how much additional there is in Q4 and is there kind of a stranded cost element with lighting that we should be thinking about? Craig Arnold : I\u2019d say that if you think about the incremental restructuring in Q4. I mean, order magnitude, Jeff, we\u2019re talking about a couple of $0.02 to $0.03 or so in Q4 from where we\u2019ve been and I think the source of that question is what do you do with the stranded cost, You sell a $1.7 billion business obviously there is some stranded costs associated with that and we would fully expect to deal with all of the stranded cost. And so we will obviously in the context of the overall restructuring number that we put up and the cost of the ex that we talked about a $200 million of costs associated with the exit of Lighting embedded in that number was cost to deal with stranded costs, both at the corporate level and also inside of Electrical Products. And so we would expect to fully deal with our stranded costs inside of the business. Jeff Sprague : Could you also elaborate a little bit, and I don\u2019t know if you need to pull it apart EP versus ESS but just kind of the trajectory of price in your business. And then just kind of the price cost algorithm looking into Q4 in the early part of next year. Craig Arnold : Yes, what we have always said around price cost is that we are net neutral and that\u2019s really today I\u2019d say where we ultimately will end up. I think we\u2019re slightly positive in Q3, just slightly positive but we would expect once again on a go forward basis that commodity cost inflation tariff driven cost increases that the company will fully offset that and we\u2019ll do a better job of making sure that we\u2019re getting price at the same moment that we\u2019re experiencing the cost but we really expect it to be net neutral to Eaton overall. Jeff Sprague : Alright. Thank you. Yan Jin : Our next question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Andrew Obin : Hi, guys. How are you? Craig Arnold : Good. Andrew Obin : Just great execution. Question on Hydraulics as we think about production cuts at Cat and Deere, when do those get incorporated into your revenues, are we seeing some of them in Q3 or is that something we\u2019re going to see in queue? When do we see the bulk of it, that\u2019s what\u2026 Craig Arnold : I appreciate the question Andrew as well, because it\u2019s what we\u2019ve been dealing. We typically would run about 90 days in front of our customers in terms of whatever they\u2019re forecasting in Q4, we would have experienced in Q3 just given the lead time all the way back to the supply chain on many of the components that were sourcing and this is typical, by the way, if you take a look at this business over time, we typically see an outsize impact both on the way up and on the way down, when our big OEM customers go through these periods of a market correction. Andrew Obin : Got it. And then the question in terms of shortfall, I know there was a quote from you that you were expecting 3% you got 1% and I know you gave it to us by end markets but can you just give a big geography buckets which one disappointed the most and that is obvious. I mean\u2026 Craig Arnold : Sure. And I\u2019d say that, in terms of end market specifically, it really was a down shifting in the growth rate let\u2019s say, the biggest market for us is always the U.S. market and I would say\u2026 Andrew Obin : Yes, that\u2019s what I was referring to. Yes. Craig Arnold : Still positive growth for sure across the board but certainly we saw a downshifting in the rate of growth in the Americas, we saw it in our Electrical Systems and Services business in large projects we saw in the distribution channel and Electrical Products. We saw a downshifting and growth in the oil and gas space, specifically in our Crouse-Hinds business. Andrew Obin : Okay, thank you. Yan Jin : Our next question comes from Chris Glynn with Oppenheimer. Chris Glynn : Thank you. Good morning. So on Hydraulics with the restructuring kind of back-tail and a little more in the fourth quarter, and some comments about moving past inefficiencies, just wondering can you raise margins a little on, you are moderately down revs next year and the 13% kind of the bottom of your through the cycle range. Do you see that is being attainable? Craig Arnold : I appreciate the question and the goal that we set for this business 13% at the bottom of the cycle, we think it\u2019s absolutely the right goal for the business and we think it\u2019s certainly attainable. I think the real question becomes where do these markets ultimately bottom out at but I think it would not be an unreasonable expectation that the business deliver, 13% margin at the level of economic activity that we\u2019re seeing right now in the business. Chris Glynn : Okay, thanks. And then a bookkeeping one, any early kind of notional comments on the corporate guidance for next year, should we just leave it comparable? Richard Fearon : We have got to work through our planning. As a general matter, we have been quite successful at holding our corporate costs flat year-to-year. And then down years taking it down a little bit. So that will give you some color. Chris Glynn : Perfect. Thank you. Yan Jin : Our next question comes from Ann Duignan with JPMorgan. Ann Duignan : Thank you. Most of my questions have been answered. If I look at ESS, the Momentum Index has been weak all year, up a little bit in September but that reflects new projects being considered and should be a good leading indicator for ESS for next year. Where is the disconnect because they are seeing is it may be not momentum index, but you\u2019re seeing the actual Dodge Data improves and that\u2019s subscribing current orders? Craig Arnold : I appreciate the question and because we spent a lot of time obviously internally trying to figure this one out as well. It is a long-cycle business playing across a very wide set of end markets. And I\u2019d say that a lot of the macro data to your point and what we saw certainly in our own order book in Q3 was quite positive and with orders up 5% on a rolling 12% and 8% excluding data centers, those are pretty strong numbers. And I\u2019d say you can always find in this business that in any given quarter, you could end up with numbers that vary from the kind of the longer-term or medium-term growth rates. And I think what we experienced in Q3 as we indicated was this largely a pull back, a large projects and some project delays and a bit of slowdown on oil and gas, but certainly what we\u2019ve seen in Q3 and what we see in most of the macro indicators for this business, non-res construction continues to do well across the world. I mean, a little bit of moderation in the growth rates but still growth. And so, we remain optimistic about the prospects for this business. Ann Duignan : Okay. I appreciate the color. And then just a follow-up on e-mobility, you normally report mature year revenue win but that business has accomplished. Could you update us on that? Craig Arnold : In this quarter and I say we haven\u2019t had any new material wins in the quarter. So what we try to do in this business as you know these wins come in large chunks and as we get large material wins we will be sure to update you on how we\u2019re doing. But by and large we continue to be very optimistic. The business as we reported historically we are ahead of the schedule that we originally set out for the business and we\u2019re still extremely confident in our ability to create a $2 billion to $4 billion new segment for the company. Ann Duignan : Okay. And I have from the last quarter that you\u2019re material revenue wins were about 390 million, is that still what I should think about? Craig Arnold : Yes I mean they would have moved up slightly from that end but we\u2019ll try to get report, material wins, when the number moves in a material way, we\u2019ll give you an update. Ann Duignan : Okay, I appreciate that. That\u2019s it from me. Thank you. Craig Arnold : Thank you. Yan Jin : Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Julian Mitchell : Hi, good morning. Craig Arnold : Hi, Julian. Julian Mitchell : May be just a first question around these ESS incrementals, very, very good performance, just wanted to make sure that there was nothing particular you saw around mix or something as a tailwind that you think would fade, what do you think this is just normal course of business and reflect sort of good project discipline? Craig Arnold : I\u2019d say that we obviously took a strong look ourselves that this business because the margins at 18.3% are very, very high and above our own expectations. And no, we did not see favorable mix in the quarter when we look at that issue specifically and it wasn\u2019t mix it really was largely this strong execution in the quarter. And I mean obviously there is always a mix of projects in any given quarter in ES&S.but no there was no particular unusual of one-time events that drove the performance. Julian Mitchell : Thank you. That\u2019s helpful. And then secondly maybe switching to Electrical Products, you do have some reasonably large industrial and industrial controls exposure within EP, particularly now that Lighting is coming out? Maybe talk about that more industrial piece of EP, how you saw demand trends there in recent months and if you expect in Q4 demand in that industrial piece of EP to be any different in Q4 than Q3? Craig Arnold : We appreciate the question, without a doubt, that the weakest piece of the business today, year-to-date and what we\u2019re forecasting is really what\u2019s going on in industrial markets in the manufacturing sector. And we generally talk about that being about a third of the business itself. And so it\u2019s a big material segment for us and we clearly have continued to see weakness in the industrial controls part of the business. Richard Fearon : And then that was true Julian both on sales and orders in the third quarter. Julian Mitchell : Great, thank you very much. Yan Jin : Our next question comes from Rob McCarthy with Stephens. Rob McCarthy : Hi, Rob McCarthy here. I guess the first question I would have is, and thinking about the sale Lighting, I mean I think it was 7.5 times trailing, it was certainly less than that on a forward basis. Horseshoes and hand grenades paid between 11x and 12x for Cooper, even if that was like, I had a company average. I mean, yes, we will be good to have of maturity of what you\u2019re talking about. But this is an exactly value creating into you are buying assets 12x and then at 7.5x trailing call it 7 or 8 years later. So, I mean do you think that this kind of activity kind of the, why the fact that perhaps we should look they can look at a part of what we had breaking up the company? Richard Fearon : Well, Rob, let me just address that. I don\u2019t think your perspective is exactly correct, I mean do you have an idea the Lighting business when we bought Cooper. It was just under $1.2 billion and now at $1.7 billion, so we\u2019ve grown the business quite significantly over the time period. And if you sort of disaggregate what we paid for the Lighting business as part of Cooper, it\u2019s not an awful lot different than what we sold it for. And now we thought that the business could migrate in certain ways and mailed closer to the broader Electrical franchise and it really has not and that\u2019s one of the reason we believe it\u2019s more appropriate as part of another Lighting enterprise or possibly as a public company, which was our original game plan but we would argue that we haven\u2019t dramatically impacted value in the case of Lighting. If it happen sometimes businesses don\u2019t end up developing in a way that you expect. Rob McCarthy : Alright. And then in terms of the cash generation of the businesses, I mean, in the context of how you\u2019re thinking about your trough and the cash EPS trough, certainly, I think you would highlight rightfully so strong cash conversion overall. Are you still subscribing to the kind of the trough and the way to think about the trough as you articulated earlier in the year and as anything change there with respect to either cash generation in the down cycle or the trough itself, can we rely on that as we kind of anchor to win work particularly as we go into a tougher macro economic environment? Richard Fearon : If you\u2019re talking about by trough, well our cash flow change markedly in a down year, we still believe it\u2019s not likely too, right and simply because we liquidate working capital that offsets the profits loss through lower volume. So, even if we had down year at some point in the next couple of years, we don\u2019t think you\u2019d see a market change in cash generation and one other point I would like to make about cash flow, I think it\u2019s important if you think about our free cash flow in 2019 based on the guidance we\u2019ve given and that compared to 2018, we\u2019re guiding to up 23% and I think that\u2019s a pretty notable number. At the end of the day, the real value of most businesses of the cash they generate and we\u2019re generating really attractive increases in cash flow in \u201819 and we would expect continuity and debt cash generation next year. And absolutely cash flow is a very strong. I guess what I was alluding to specifically was the framework I believe Craig laid out for a trough scenario we are still arriving to that. Craig Arnold : Yes. You are talking about, we have at least flat EPS in a trough year and we continue to believe that is the base case plan. And the only caveat we\u2019d add is that we said post the spin off of our sale of Lighting and post this divestiture of FCD and we would expect to get the FCD transaction done by the end of the year, and lighting some timing in Q1 but post those transactions we absolutely have the plan and fully committed to delivering flat EPS what we call a typical economic recession which we define is two to three quarters of GDP contraction. Rob McCarthy : Thanks for your time. I appreciate it. Yan Jin : Good. Our last question comes from Deane Dray with RBC. Deane Dray : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Craig Arnold : Hi, Deane. Deane Dray : I was hoping to get a spotlight on a specific geography and a vertical, what can you tell us about China, the tone of business, the outlook and then data centers has come up during the call, any specifics there in terms of the outlook? Thanks. Craig Arnold : I appreciate the question, Deane. I think China, if you think about across the broad swath of businesses that we deal and maybe deal with a positive first I\u2019d say kind of the non-res construction and quite frankly even res construction in China actually continues to perform very well and you see some of this data as well. But that will off starts in Q3, we\u2019re actually up 10% and are up 16% year-to-date. Residential starts are up 6% in Q3 and 9% year to date. And so the whole kind of construction market in China is doing well. And quite frankly, even on the Hydraulics side excavator sales continue to grow quite nicely in Q3, up 16% and excavators and up 7% in real world and so that piece of the business in China is actually doing quite well. By contrast, light motor vehicle production is down quite significantly, down 7% in Q3 and 12% year-to-date as well as heavy duty truck production is about flat. And so, it really is a very different story depending upon which end market you referring to. But in the most important part of our company, let\u2019s call it, in the Electrical side non-res construction the market is holding up quite well. Deane Dray : Great. Craig Arnold : And then typically the data centers, as we mentioned in the opening commentary, in our data center business performed very well in the quarter. We ended up seeing high single-digit growth in data centers and so that market continues to perform very well. And as we\u2019ve mentioned on other earnings calls that the hyperscale stuff does tend to be lumpy, and we continue to see that lumpiness, but by and large, we continue to see very good growth in data centers. Deane Dray : Craig, just last one for me, the lowering of the CapEx by $50 million. Is there any story behind that? Craig Arnold : No, I\u2019d say that\u2019s just really fine-tuning the outlook for the year. Our businesses tend to be low optimistic. The only course of the planning process around what they can get done, that\u2019s really just largely a true up. We\u2019ve not done anything to put any clamps on our capex spending. We\u2019re still spending on every program that we can get done. Deane Dray : Great, thanks for the color. Yan Jin : Great. Thank you all. We have reached to the end of our call. And we do appreciate everybody\u2019s question. As always Craig and I will be available to address any follow-up questions. Thank you all. Have a good day. Craig Arnold : Thank you.

Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Also, as a reminder, today's teleconference is being recorded. At this time, we'll turn the conference over to your host, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Yan Jin. Please go ahead. Yan Jin : Hey, good morning, everyone. I'm Yan Jin, Eaton's Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you all for joining us today for Eaton's fourth quarter 2019 earnings call. With me today are Craig Arnold, our Chairman and CEO; and Rick Fearon, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial and Planning Officer. Our agenda today includes the opening remarks by Craig highlighting the company's performance in the fourth quarter. As we have done in our past calls, we'll be taking questions at the end of Craig's comments. The press release from our earnings announcement this morning and also the presentation we'll go through today have been posted on our website at www.eaton.com. Please note that both the press release and the presentation include reconciliation to non-GAAP measures. A webcast of this call is accessible on our website and it will be available for replay. Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our comments today including statements relate to the expected future results of the company and are therefore forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our projected future earnings due to a wide range of risk and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and the presentation. They're also outlined in our related 8-K filing. With that, I will turn it over to Craig. Craig Arnold : Okay. Thanks, Yan. I appreciate it. And we'll start with Page 3 with our recent highlights. Two weeks ago, as everybody knows, we announced the agreement to sell our Hydraulics business to Danfoss for $3.3 billion, which represents a 13.2 times 2019 EBITDA. This decision is part of the ongoing transformation of Eaton into a company with higher growth, higher margins and more consistent earnings. So we're really pleased with that. We believe this transaction will create substantial value for our shareholders and allow our Hydraulics\u2019 employees, importantly, to become part of a company that has a strong commitment to the hydraulics industry. Our team has made significant progress on other portfolio actions, including closing the acquisition of Souriau-Sunbank and the sale of our Automotive Fluid Conveyance business at the end of the year. The sale of our Lighting business is expected to close in Q1. And as you've read, we just announced the acquisition of Power Distribution, Inc. Power Distribution, Inc. is a $125 million company that serves the data center market and will become part of our Electrical Systems and Services business. Switching to our Q4 results, and I'd summarize the quarter's performance as one with strong earnings, record margins, strong cash flow despite a slower than expected growth in our end markets. Organic revenue, excluding Lighting and Hydraulics, was down 2%. Earnings per share of $1.49 on a GAAP basis and $1.46 excluding $0.28 of acquisition and divestiture costs and $0.09 for costs we expect to incur related to vehicle warranty. At $1.46, our results were flat with last year and at the high end of our guidance range of $1.36 to $1.46. Our sales of $5.2 billion were down 4% organically with negative currency of a 0.5%, offset by a 0.5% from acquisitions. We continue to generate strong margins and delivered a Q4 record of 17.8%, excluding acquisition and divestiture costs and the expected vehicle warranty costs. These margins were above the high end of our guidance range and 40 basis points above prior year. And we're also pleased with our operating cash flows, which were $937 million in the quarter. So stepping back, I think we'd all agree that it's been a busy and a very productive period for Eaton. Turning to Page 4, we summarize our Q4 financial performance and I'll note just a few highlights on this page. First, we increased our adjusted segment operating margins by 40 basis points. And our team, I'd say here, executed well and we had decremental margins of less than 10%. Second, our adjusted segment operating profits were $933 million, down 2% despite 4% lower organic sales. Net income of $452 million was down 28% and this was primarily due to acquisition and divestiture costs of $114 million and vehicle warranty charges of $39 million. And both of these numbers, I would note, are on an after-tax basis. Similar to Q3, these strong results are I think a good indication of how we intend to manage the company during periods of market weakness, running our operations efficiently, proactively managing costs and accelerating our share repurchases. Moving to Page 5, we'll start with our segment summaries with Electrical Products. Revenues were down 2%, and excluding Lighting, organic revenue increased 1%. Strength was driven by residential markets in the Americas, our distribution business in Canada. Adjusted segment operating profits increased 9% and adjusted operating margins were up 210 basis points to 20.3%, a Q4 record. The sale of our Lighting business to Signify for $1.4 billion remains on track and we expect to close in Q1. Excluding Lighting, orders were down 2% with strength in residential, commercial construction markets in the Americas, and this was really offset by industrial markets globally. Turning to Page 6, we show a summary of our Electrical Systems and Services segment. Revenues increased 4% with 2% organic and 2% from the acquisition of Ulusoy and Innovative Switchgear Solutions. Organic growth was driven by strength in the North America utility and commercial construction markets, primarily. Adjusted segment operating profits increased 7% with adjusted margins of 17.1%, up 50 basis points over prior year. And on a rolling 12-month basis, our Electrical Systems and Services orders increased 2.5% with growth really across all regions of the world. Excluding hyperscale data centers, the 12-month rolling average of orders was up some 4%. And just yesterday, we announced the acquisition of Power Distribution, Inc., which is a leading supplier of mission critical power distribution, switching and power monitoring equipment for the data center market. Power Distribution, Inc., really builds on our strong position in the fast growing data center market and adds new capabilities in the area of overhead busway and power distribution. So we're really pleased with the prospects of what PDI will add to our Electrical Systems and Services business. Moving to Page 7, we summarize our Hydraulics results for Q4. Revenues were down 13%, with orders down 11%. And this is driven by continued weakness in global mobile equipment markets and destocking that continues at both OEM and also with our distributors. And as I mentioned earlier, we're really pleased to have announced the agreement to sell the Hydraulics business to Danfoss for $3.3 billion and we expect this transaction to close at the end of the year. And as we've announced, we are retaining our Filtration and Golf Grip businesses. We expect cash taxes from the sale of Hydraulics to be approximately $450 million. So our net proceeds will be approximately $2.85 billion. And a number of you have asked how we intend to use proceeds, and I'd say that the options of additional acquisitions and share repurchases are both on the table. For M&A, we would also add that our pipeline remains very active. And so it's great to have this optionality as we look forward. On Page 8, we summarize our results for our Aerospace segment. Revenues were up 3%, including 2% organic and 1% from acquisitions. We experienced in this segment continued strength in commercial OEMs and also in commercial aftermarket. Orders on a rolling 12-month basis increased 6% with particular strength in military and aftermarket and bizjet. Certainly strong execution in this segment led to a 9% increase in adjusted segment operating profits and 130 basis point improvement in adjusted margins, which were 24.2%. And I just say here that the business delivered another quarterly record, capping what's been a very strong year. We're also pleased to have closed the acquisition of Souriau in late December. We welcome the Souriau team to Eaton and our integration teams have already begun working to deliver the synergy plans, which includes the opportunity to take our new electrical connectors capabilities into our core electrical markets. Turning to Page 9, we summarize our Vehicle business for Q4. Revenues were down 19% and this includes 18% organic and 1% from currency. Declines here were due to a number of factors : the GM strike, Class 8 OEM orders, in fact, Class 8 production was down some 20% year-over-year and continued global weakness in light vehicle markets, which were down 9%. And I'd say here and a clear example of our grow the head and fix the tail strategy, which is really about how we've really focused the company. We completed the sale of our Automotive Fluid Conveyance business at the end of the year. During the quarter, we also took a $50 million pre-tax charge for expected warranty costs. This charge is being undertaken to correct the performance of one of our products that incorporated a defective part from a supplier and we're actively looking for ways of recouping these costs as well. Adjusted operating margins were 17%, at a very high level, but down 90 basis points from prior year. Next up on Page 10, we summarize the results for our eMobility segment. Revenues were down 6% and I'd say here, while growth in electric vehicle platforms, this was more than offset by weakness in legacy internal combustion engine platforms. Operating margins declined to 1.3% due to a significant step up in research and development as well as manufacturing start-up costs associated with electric vehicle programs here. I would like to highlight that since the formation of this segment in the first quarter of 2018, the mature year revenue from new wins is expected to be $450 million and so this segment continues to run ahead of our own internal expectations and as you can imagine, we're pursuing a large number of additional programs as the industry continues to make the transition to electric vehicles. Before turning to 2020 guidance, I would like to take a minute just to summarize the results of 2019, which are shown on Page 11. First, we generated all-time record margins of 17.6%, which were up 80 basis points over 2018 excluding acquisition and divestiture costs and the expected warranty costs. In fact, over the last three years, our segment margins have increased 260 basis points, which we see as a strong validation of our strategy. Earnings per share of $5.76 excluding the one-time items I just mentioned was up 7% over 2018. We set all-time records for both operating cash flow of $3.5 billion and free cash flow of $2.9 billion, with growth of 17% and 20% respectively. Our free cash flow to sales was 13.4% and our free cash flow to net income conversion was 129%. This continues to be a key strength for Eaton and something that you can expect from us in the future. And as we noted, 2009 [ph] was a year of significant progress on our journey to transform Eaton into a company with higher growth, higher margins and more earnings consistency. We closed three deals for $1. 2 billion : Ulusoy, Innovative Switchgear in Electrical; Souriau-Sunbank in Aerospace. We announced two divestitures with Automotive Fluid conveyance closed in 2019 and Lighting scheduled to close in Q1. And our robust cash flow allowed us to return $2.2 billion to shareholders including $1.2 billion of dividends and $1 billion in share repurchases. I'd also note that we purchased these shares at an average price of $80 a share. Finally, it was a very good year for our shareholders, who had a 43% total return, 50 basis points over the median of our proxy peer. So overall, I'd say another record year and clearly very proud of what our team was able to deliver. Turning to Page 12, we provide our revenue and margin guidance for 2020. Overall, we expect organic growth to be anywhere from down 1% to up 1% with weakness in the first half and a bit stronger in the second half as a result of easier prior year comps. Beginning with Electrical Products, we expect to see 1% to 3% organic growth with continued strength in residential and data center markets, flat commercial construction markets, and continued weakness in industrial markets. In Electrical Systems and Services, we anticipate zero to 2% organic growth with strength in utility markets, flat commercial construction, and weakness in industrial facilities and particularly in oil and gas markets. For Hydraulics, we're forecasting organic revenue declines of 4% to 6% driven by weakness in global mobile equipment markets and in Aerospace, we expect organic growth of 2% to 4% with continued strength in military OEM markets, solid aftermarket growth for both commercial and military markets partially offset by expected weakness in commercial OEM markets. For Vehicle, we see organic revenue declines of 7% to 9% and this is mostly due to the 33% decline that we're forecasting in NAFTA Class 8 truck markets, but also some weakness in global light vehicle markets as well. And for eMobility, organic growth is expected to be up 3% to 5%. We're seeing double-digit growth for our electrical vehicles markets, offset by some modest declines in internal combustion engine platforms. Now turning to segment operating margins and operating margins for Eaton. We expect Eaton to be 17.8% to 18.2% at the midpoint, a 40 basis points improvement from 2019 and in taking a look at our segments, Electrical Products we think will be 21.2% to 21.8%. At the midpoint, 180 basis point improvement from 2019 and this is primarily a result of the Lighting divestiture. For Electrical Systems and Services, we're forecasting 16.4% to 17%, up 10 basis points at the midpoint. Hydraulics at 11.7% to 12.3%, up 80 basis points at the midpoint. Aerospace at 22.9% to 23.5%, down some 110 basis points, and this is largely due to the acquisition of Souriau. And Vehicle we expect it to be between 15.7% and 16.3%, down 80 basis points and largely as a result of lower volumes, and eMobility at 2.5% to 3% as we continue to invest heavily in R&D and start-up costs and new manufacturing capabilities. And on Page 13, we pick up the balance of our 2020 guidance and here I'd say we expect full year adjusted EPS to be between $5.60 and $5.90 at the midpoint of $5.75. This is essentially flat with 2019 when you exclude the one-time items noted on previous slides. Organic growth is expected to be essentially down 1% to up 1% with acquisitions adding 2% and divestitures negatively impacting sales by 7.5%. We expect our corporate costs including pension, interest and other corporate costs to be flat with 2019 levels and our tax rate to be between 14.8% and 15.8%. Operating cash flow is expected to be between $3.4 billion and $3.6 billion and CapEx of approximately $550 million. With strong cash flow plus the proceeds from the Lighting sale, which we think will be $1.4 billion, we plan to significantly increase our share repurchases and at this point, we expect to spend between $2.4 billion and $2.8 billion in share repurchases. And if I can just summarize our Q1 guidance, we expect EPS to be between $1.16 and $1.26; we expect organic revenues to be down 3%, 2% from acquisitions and 3% from divestitures; segment margins are expected to be between 15.8% and 16.2% and our tax rate should be between 15% and 16%. So overall, I'd say we expect really another solid year in 2020 with strong margins and cash flow. We have a lot of confidence in the Eaton business system and our ability to continue to execute strongly. We think the changes that we've made and announced will position Eaton for higher growth and higher margins and better earnings consistency as we go forward and with our strong cash flow and proceeds from the Hydraulics sale, we have outstanding optionality as we go into the best approach to create additional shareholder value. So with that, I'll stop there and turn it back over to Yan for questions. Yan Jin : Hey, thanks Craig. Before we begin the Q&A section of our call today, I think that we have a number of individuals in the queue with questions. Given our time constraint of an hour, please limit your opportunity to just one question and a follow-up. Thanks everyone for your cooperation. With that, I will turn it over to the operator to give guys the instruction Operator : Thank you very much. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead. Craig Arnold : Hi, Jeff. Jeff Sprague : Okay. Hey, two things for me. First, on Hydraulics, given just kind of the slippery slope that the end markets are on, certainly great to see it go at that valuation. But are you guys subject to any kind of holdback or performance that could affect kind of the ultimate price that you receive for the assets? Craig Arnold : Yes. No, Jeff, we're not. I mean, and I think we actually posted our documents. And so that information is certainly available for public consumption. And the $3.3 billion number is firm, and we fully expect to close, as Danfoss has also agreed, to take whatever remedies would be required in order to ensure that the transaction closes. Jeff Sprague : Great. And just a guidance question, too. I was just wondering on ESS specifically, zero to 2%. Does that sort of imply you're going to be up a bit in the first half and then down in the second half? Or how do you see that really playing out relative to what's going on in your backlog? Craig Arnold : I think we see it almost, Jeff, just the opposite of that. I mean we -- given what we've seen certainly in our order intake and negotiations, we think that the back half of the year will be slightly stronger than the first half of the year and as we take a look at what we're experiencing today, one of the reasons why we guided to our overall revenues being down 3% in Q1. And so we do think at the back half of the year, we'll be slightly stronger. And a lot of that, I'd say, quite frankly, is a function of easier comps when you look at the year-over-year comparisons. And from an EPS standpoint, we're really pretty much well balanced in terms of where -- what we've been historically, where some 47% of our EPS is generated in the first half of the year and 53% in the second half. And so that's very much consistent with our guidance this year as well. Jeff Sprague : Great. Thanks for the color. Operator : Thank you very much. And our next question in queue that will come from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Joe Ritchie : Good morning everyone. Craig Arnold : Hi. Joe Ritchie : Craig, maybe just kind of starting off on Hydraulics, and congratulations there, obviously. I guess as you think about the pipeline, you mentioned very active. I'd love to hear how you're thinking about potential prioritization of acquisitions? And then also, you've been very active from a divestiture standpoint. Are we done at this point? Craig Arnold : Yes. I appreciate the comment, Joe. And as I mentioned in my opening commentary, we think it's an outstanding outcome for all parties. We think it's great for Eaton and our shareholders. We think it's outstanding for our employees and great for Danfoss as well. I'd say the priority for us really haven't changed. What we've said historically is that our priorities, from an M&A perspective, continue to be growing our Electrical business, Aerospace and also selectively, we're looking at things that we could potentially do in this new space for us called eMobility. And so those priorities really have not changed. As I mentioned in my commentary, we are seeing today kind of a more active pipeline than we've seen historically. And so as we think about the optionality of what we do with that cash, certainly, M&A is an option, buying back shares is an option. So we're very much comfortable with where we sit in terms of making sure that we maximize shareholder value as we think about how we deploy that -- those proceeds that will come in. And with respect to portfolio, we like where we sit. I mean it's -- at this point, if you think about the remaining parts of our company, and I know there's been a lot of speculation about Vehicle. So I'll go ahead and address that right up front. We like our Vehicle business. It delivers extraordinary margins, and they tend to be at the very top of their industry with respect to returns. The business today, given what we've done today with our joint venture in Cummins, will be a lot less cyclical as we go forward. It certainly helps us as the whole world moves towards this more electric outcome to getting the volume and scale that we need to really drive dividends across the organization. And so yes, we absolutely like our portfolio and where we sit today. Joe Ritchie : That's helpful. And then just one quick one on Aero. I don't recall you guys having much exposure to the MAX. But can you maybe just talk about that specifically as it relates to your guidance, and also how you think about margins in the Aero segment as well in 2020, just given the strength in 2019? Craig Arnold : Yes. I think the MAX is an important program for Eaton as well. I think anybody in the aerospace industry; I'd say the MAX is going to be an important program for them. And so our content tied to the MAX at the OEM level is, order of magnitude, just north of $100 million. And what we've done as a part of the Aerospace forecast in our guidance is we've essentially taken what Boeing has given us in terms of their current build schedule, and that's what's reflected in our Aerospace guidance. One of the reasons why we're not seeing more robust growth in our Aerospace business in 2020 is clearly the impact of the MAX. I will tell you, as you think about the margin implications for the MAX, which you typically trade-off with OEM volume, is aftermarket volume. And so we think from a margin perspective, independent of what happens with the MAX, we think the margins will be just fine. We think we'll be just fine from an EPS standpoint, but it could have certainly an impact on revenue. So our Aerospace margins as we provided guidance, 2019 was a record year with really extraordinary improvement in our margins. The margins will be down slightly in 2020. And this, as we mentioned, was largely a function of the acquisition of Souriau. But also, we were running at very frothy levels in 2019 in terms of the margins of the businesses. So we think the guidance that we provided for 2020 are very much in line with where we think the business should be. Joe Ritchie : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question that will come from John Walsh with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. John Walsh : Hi, good morning. Craig Arnold : Good morning. John Walsh : And congrats on Hydraulics. I'll echo everyone's comments. Can you help us or can you tell us what the exiting share count was? And then how we should be thinking about the cadence of the repurchases through 2020? Rick Fearon : Yes. I will -- I'll address that. The total share count for Q4 was 450 million. It was not very different right at the end of the year. In terms of repurchases, we are going to do as we've done in the past. We decided against doing an accelerated repurchase, and we're going to execute the transactions on our own. We do have the ability to buy about $70 million worth a day based on the safe harbor. So we can make significant moves fairly quickly. And we will be executing those repurchases as we deem it most effective for our shareholders, obviously, taking into account market conditions. John Walsh : Great. Thank you. And then as we think about the EP orders ex-Lighting down 2%, can you maybe help parse that out between end market and if you're still seeing any kind of destocking at your distributor partners? Craig Arnold : Yes. Appreciate the question. I mean if we think about markets, I mean, as we provided a little bit of color on it, we think today that we still see growth in non-res construction. We did mention the fact that commercial construction, we think, is flat. We think industrial controls will be down, but residential continues to be up nicely, we think mid-single digit. And the IT piece of data centers, which is reported through Electrical Products, we think it'll also be up low single digit. And so we think on balance, these markets continued to kind of bounce around the low kind of single-digit growth kind of neighborhood. And we're hopeful, once again, that as some of this uncertainty continues to ebb away as it relates to trade, as it relates to the North American trade agreement that, that continues to buoy confidence in our customers in general. And I think in general, distribution is fine. I mean distribution, certainly in Q4, held in there. And our distributors are generally pretty positive around 2020. So we think distribution continues to be a strong point as well. John Walsh : Great. I\u2019ll pass it along. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Nigel Coe : Thanks. Good morning, guys. Craig Arnold : Hi, Nigel. Nigel Coe : Obviously, there's a lot of moving pieces on the portfolio. Just to be clear, so given the buyback you got in place for 2020, does that offset the dilution completely from Lighting, but you still have some dilution, obviously, coming in the first half of the year? And then, Rick, on the tax rate, does the portfolio moves have any significant impact on the tax rate, both ex Lighting, but also ex Hydraulics? Rick Fearon : I can answer both those questions. Yes, the buyback does offset the dilution, so that's why we're able to keep earning EPS flat between the years. And then the tax rate, we don't think will be changed from these portfolio actions. So we still think it'll be between 14% and 16%. Nigel Coe : Okay. Great. And my follow-up question is regarding distributor consolidation. Obviously, WESCO's an important channel partner for Eaton. How does -- feel about larger distributor partners impact your business the way you go to market? Craig Arnold : Yes, I think it's obviously a question of which distributor combinations we're talking about. And as it relates to WESCO's acquisition of Anixter, which is maybe the one that's prompted the question, we think that's an outstanding combination for Eaton and our relationship with WESCO as we go forward. And so we think that one is really positive for Eaton, and we have a very strong relationship with WESCO, as you know. And we have a very strong relationship with Anixter. So we think that combination bodes extremely well for our future together and certainly is positive for Eaton. Nigel Coe : Great. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you very much. The next question in queue will come from Scott Davis with Melius Research. Please go ahead. Scott Davis : Hi, good morning guys. Craig Arnold : Hi, Scott. Scott Davis : A lot of good questions have been asked already, but I would love to hear your view, Craig, as you walk around the world, what markets you think are going to be or what geographies, I guess, more specifically, are going to be better or worse than perhaps 2019 run rate? Craig Arnold : Yes. Yes, I appreciate the question. And I think in many ways, Scott that is the $64,000 question in terms of what the future economic outlook looks like. And I'd say, if you'd asked me that question maybe three weeks ago before the coronavirus, I would say, China, for sure. I mean clearly, we saw a much stronger Q4 in China, and that economy had continued to strengthen. We'll see what the coronavirus does in terms of the impact in China, and really, the impact that it has around the world. We clearly see somewhat slowing growth in the U.S. But there are certainly pockets of strength. Residential markets continue to be quite strong. Data center markets continue to be strong. Utility markets continue to be strong. We think South America will have a better year than they had in 2019 as they work through some of their historical issues. And so we're clearly seeing some strengthening in South America. We think Europe slows a bit overall. We think India had a really tough year in 2019. We think India is better as well. And if you think about a lot of the emerging markets around the world, we think they generally have better years in 2020 than they did in 2019. Scott Davis : Okay. Helpful. And the one thing that -- I know eMobility is small, but what are you thinking over the next kind of three years we should be tracking and caring more about? Is it the backlog that you're building in the business? Would you start to get a sell-through in 2021 that's meaningful? That, that segment starts to move the needle with some sort of margin attached to it? And just a sense of is this a five-year out, three-year out or start to see progress kind of a year-and-change from now? Craig Arnold : Yes. I appreciate the question, Scott, and it's one that we get from others as well. And we'd say that -- and the real inflection point for eMobility will be around 2022. We -- a lot of these new electric vehicle platforms will launch in 2021. And so we think it's really 2022 before you get to the point where you start to see revenues that have a meaningful impact on our eMobility segment, and for Eaton overall. But as you think about the underlying assumption and what's going on in electrification in general, we think the story around electrification is obviously much bigger than what's going on in eMobility and passenger cars as we think about the more electric everything. Homes are becoming more electrified, commercial facilities, planes, trains, everything is becoming more electric. And one of the real advantages we think we have with respect to our eMobility segment is that anytime you're dealing with automotive kinds of scales, you're now also creating real advantages that you can then take back into your core business as well. And so we think there's a much bigger story and a much bigger play for Eaton as we think about how we play in eMobility than just what happens in the light vehicle market. Scott Davis : Okay. Perfect. Thank you. Good luck guys. Craig Arnold : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question, that will come from Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Nicole DeBlase : Yes, thanks. Good morning, guys. Rick Fearon : Hi. Craig Arnold : Hi. Good morning, Nicole. Nicole DeBlase : So I just want to start with a clarification. Just -- I'm 99% sure this is the way you guys are doing your guidance. But Lighting is excluded beginning in the like, first day of the second quarter. Is that correct? Rick Fearon : Well, we actually have put it in for two months, sort of the middle of the first quarter. Nicole DeBlase : Okay. That's helpful, Rick. And then when we think about rolling forward the calendar on free cash flow after you guys complete the Hydraulics sale, would that create a major change in your free cash flow relative to how you guys have guided for 2020? Rick Fearon : Well, first of all, we expect the sale to conclude at the end of the year. So it shouldn't have really any impact on 2020. Nicole DeBlase : Right. But I'm thinking about like framing 2021 free cash? Craig Arnold : Yes. What I'm seeing -- Nicole, with respect to Hydraulics, I mean, I think what you'll see from the company in general, post-Hydraulics is a company that will deliver, once again, more consistent free cash flow as a function of that industry, in general. The cash flows in Hydraulics are about as volatile as the industry itself. So I think what you'll see from Eaton post the divesture of Hydraulics is a company that delivers, once again, very strong free cash flow, and you'll see a lot more consistency overall. Nicole DeBlase : Got it. That\u2019s fair. Thanks, Craig. I\u2019ll pass it on. Craig Arnold : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question in queue that will come from David Raso with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. David Raso : Hi, good morning. I just want to check whether I have the math correct backing out Lighting and looking at the Electrical Products margin improvement. The guidance shows 180 bps, and it depends on exactly the revenues for the 10 months that you won't have Lighting. I'm using about $1.45 [ph] billion. So I know we don't have the exact margin on Lighting but obviously, it was below the segment average. So I'm just trying to back into what is the margin improvement just excluding Lighting from 10 months? I mean I'm getting as much as 140 bps, 130 bps. And then that leads to kind of legacy Electrical Product not really having to expand margins much to hit the target? Craig Arnold : Yes, I think that's a fair way of thinking about it, Dave. Something just north of 100 bps of improvement from Lighting and some underlying improvement in the business is the right way to think about it. David Raso : And that said then, if the margins are, let's say, run rating close to 21, just getting rid of Lighting, I know 2% organic is not that robust, but still the margin improvement is a bit modest at least relative to your recent performance. Is there something within electrical mix, price/cost, whatever it may be, that's not allowing a little more expansion versus recent history? Craig Arnold : No, I'd say that we certainly had a very strong year in 2019 and posted very strong margin improvement. At this point, as we look at the year, we think this is the best way to think about the segment for the year. Could we be a little better than that? We hope so, but at this point, we think this is the right way to think about the segment and the appropriate guidance. David Raso : And I might have missed this, I apologize, but the assets that are left in Hydraulics after the sale, are those potential opportunities for further potential opportunities for further sales during the course of this year or is it all just TBD for right now and... Craig Arnold : Yes. So if you think about what's remaining, and we did disclose a bit kind of in the context of the Hydraulics close, these are really attractive businesses that have great positions in their respective industries, we like those assets and we intend to retain them. David Raso : Okay, thank you very much, I appreciate it Operator : Thank you. The next question will come from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Please go ahead. Julian Mitchell : Hi, good morning. Maybe just a first question around the data center market. I heard that the outlook is pretty good in the EP side, wondered if there was any nuance or difference within ESS and really the reason I ask is that the commentary perhaps as always from different people is mixed. Some of the Internet service providers sound fairly optimistic, some of the equipment suppliers like Regal or Cummins talked about push outs in data center activity this morning. So just wondered what your core assumption was for that market for this year in the medium-term? Craig Arnold : Yes, Julian, we appreciate the question and not surprising by the way that you do -- your commentary around the segment that in some cases could be in conflict depending upon where every supplier is and the timing of some of these large projects and where you are in terms of your exposure to hyperscale and other pieces of the market. I'd say for us, we do think that data center market, based upon everything that we've seen, grows kind of low single-digit in 2020, which, given kind of some of the underlying trends around data generation and consumption is a relatively modest number. We did, in fact, see a better second half of the year in hyperscale specifically, and data centers continue to be a growth segment for us overall. But I'd say that, no, I mean, Electrical Systems & Services which, as you know, and more the three phase that we report as a part of ES&S and more of the single phase that we report in Electrical Products, but we think that data centers largely, as a category, continues to be a very attractive category. And then \u2013 but it will be lumpy. There will be periods of time when you see extraordinary growth, and there will be periods of time when some of the hyperscale guys essentially take time out to absorb kind of what they've actually done and will pause in their purchases. Julian Mitchell : Thank you, Craig. And then a second question for you, maybe a slightly broader one. You've certainly surprised me with the success on the margin ramp the last couple of years. It's really been extraordinary. Just wondered if you were at all worried that, that focus on the cost out hurt the organic growth profile of Eaton at all, and how satisfied you are with that. If we look at the last five years or last 10 years, the organic sales CAGR was about 1% company-wide. Do you think that the company is now poised for that to move higher in the medium term? Craig Arnold : Maybe I'll deal with the margin question first, Julian, because I will tell you that if you think about where the margin expansion has come from inside of our company, it really has been essentially around eliminating operational inefficiencies in our company. And so we've not, in any way, sacrificed growth opportunities for the sake of margin. I think it's really around a lot of the portfolio work that we're doing as we talk about what is it that drives the margin expansion in Eaton, we talked about running our factories more efficiently. We talked about leveraging our scale. And we talked about also where we focus, this idea of grow the head and shrink the tail. And so those are the things that we've been doing as a company to accelerate margin expansion, and quite frankly, we're not done. There's more opportunities there. On the organic growth front, I'd say we, too, have not been pleased with our organic growth. It's one of the reasons why we've really set that as the number one priority for the organization and we've been investing heavily in organic growth inside of our organization. And so we think that organic growth relative to the markets that we've been, we think we've been fine. And in fact, overall, public data that we get says that we've actually gained a little share in many of our businesses, but we need to do better than that. And so that continues to be the number one priority for the organization to drive organic growth. Julian Mitchell : That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question in queue that will come from Andy Casey with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Andy Casey : Thanks a lot. Good morning, everybody. Craig Arnold : Good morning, Andy. Andy Casey : Within ESS ex the hyperscale data centers that you just went through, in the past, I think you talked about some project deferral in them. Incorporating the first half, second half directional comments, I understand those. But are you seeing any thought in the uncertainty driven project deferral at this point? Craig Arnold : Yes. I\u2019d say, Andy, maybe not really. We continue to see, I'd say, projects deferred. I would \u2013 I'd say that the rate has not escalated from what we've seen in prior quarters, but there remains a fair amount of uncertainty around the global economy. And so I think to the extent that we're dealing in this uncertain environment, whether it's trade or most recently, the coronavirus; with Brexit, I mean there's been a whole host of geopolitical events that have caused many of our customers in and around large projects, specifically, to wait and see a bit, and then that continues to be the case. But not necessarily at an increasing rate, more like in line with what we've seen during the course of much of the second half of 2019. Andy Casey : Okay. Thanks, Craig. And then secondly, on potential acquisition opportunities. Can you talk about whether the pipeline is full at this point? And relative to what you saw maybe last year, the valuation is becoming any more attractive. Craig Arnold : Yes. I'd say the pipeline is certainly more active than we've seen a year ago, and our teams are busy working through a number of potential opportunities. I think with respect to valuations, I'd say that not really. Valuations, I think, for the most part, continue to be quite sporty, and what we commit to you is that we will maintain our discipline. And we have a very clear view on what our cost of capital is and what our expected returns are. And so we will make sure that as we think about deploying our ample free cash flow that we're smart in the way we do it, and we continue to be very comfortable with the option of buying back stock. Andy Casey : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. The next question in queue will come from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Josh Pokrzywinski : Hey, good morning, guys. Craig Arnold : Hi. Josh Pokrzywinski : Craig, just a question for you on EP. One of your competitors this morning had some tariff exemption that helped out their electrical business and got a bit of a clawback going into even 2018. Anything that you guys qualified for in the EP portfolio, and any benefit that was recognized? Craig Arnold : No, not at all. There was no onetime benefits. We'd be interested to know what that was and we'll find out who that was and see if we missed something. But no, there's been \u2013 there were no onetime benefits associated with tariff exemptions in our EP results at all. Rick Fearon : And Josh, as we've commented that we produce in region for region. So we don't have large shipments coming out of China into other parts of the world. So it wouldn't be something where there would be a big opportunity for us. Josh Pokrzywinski : Got it. That's helpful. And then just a follow-up on the acquisition pipeline. I think you guys have been very clear on your role in the data center kind of being end-to-end electrical and not really wanting to stray too far from that. I guess, Craig, are there any gaps in that? Or are there other pieces that you could add on to either on the front end or closer to the rack? And as this market has evolved, are you seeing other product sets within the data center that just given the attractiveness of the end market start to look more interesting to you as you build out the portfolio? Thanks. Craig Arnold : Josh, I appreciate the question. I'd say on the margin, we have a great portfolio today that we offer and sell into data centers from all the power distribution equipment to the power quality equipment. We think this acquisition of PDI, by the way, as we mentioned, $125 million business that goes into the data center market is very much about filling a product portfolio. And also, in this case, giving us better access to the co-located \u2013 the colo operators of data centers. And so on the margins, there are some minor things that we can do, and we'll continue to look at. But by and large, we think our position in data centers is very well \u2013 very well situated, and no big gaps at all. Josh Pokrzywinski : Thanks, Craig. Operator : Thank you very much. The next question in queue that will come from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Christopher Glynn : Thanks. Good morning and congrats on an excellent 2019. Craig Arnold : Thank you. Rick Fearon : Thanks Christopher Glynn : On the - just wanted to kind of hit on Jeff's question about the ESS splits transferring that to Vehicle on the down 8% organic. I want to make sure we can get the magnitude in the first half right. So I'm wondering how you're seeing that linearity. Craig Arnold : I'm sorry, can you \u2013 so the \u2013 transferring it to vehicle. I'm not sure if I understand the\u2026 Christopher Glynn : Sorry. Just the same question, yes. Craig Arnold : Okay. Yes, I'd say that if you think about kind of our guidance with respect to revenue, we do think that the second half of the year will be a bit stronger on an EV basis versus the first half. And I would say, but more to that, I would just say, it's really more a function of the comps and the comparables year-over-year. If you take a look at \u2013 the second half of 2019 was clearly a much weaker period of time for us than the first half. And so I think it's really a function of the comparables more than it is we're anticipating anything dramatically different in terms of the seasonality that we historically see in our business with respect to our own revenue growth. Christopher Glynn : Okay. And then on the eMobility comments you made a couple of quarters in a row now about being ahead of plan. I'm wondering if you're seeing that in terms of the pace of design cycles or your win rates? Craig Arnold : Yes, I think there's probably a little bit of both. But on that one in terms of I think that every major automotive OEM around the world and commercial vehicle customer around the world. Everybody today has an initiative around electrification of their fleet, and that has certainly gained momentum, and we've been a benefactor of that. And at the same time, our team has done an extraordinary job from a standing start really building a whole broad range of product capabilities that have enabled us to really be an effective alternative and a viable alternative in this particular space. And so I think it's really been a combination. Christopher Glynn : Thank you. Operator : Thank you very much. And the next question in queue will come from Markus Mittermaier with UBS. Please go ahead. Markus Mittermaier : Improvements over the years. You've been closing the gap, to a large extent, across the electrical businesses to some of your global peers, particularly if you look at the European low voltage players. Now how should we think about this going forward? I mean are there any structural reasons why these margins shouldn't align to where some of your peers are? I mean it's already mentioned that if I take out sort of the Lighting impacts in EP ex Lighting, you are basically already up the margin levels that you're guiding for. So how should we structurally think about this, maybe not into 2020, but sort of medium term, how much upside is that closing that gap to the peers fully? Craig Arnold : Yes. I guess, Markus, I mean, the first thing I would say with respect to our Electrical business, I'd say, we don't believe there is a gap. In fact, we think, today, when you take a look at our Electrical business relative to most of our peers that our margins are actually as good as or better than most of them. You got to really think about it in the context, I'm not sure which companies you're referring to, but our Electrical Products business, for example, which is largely a components business that goes to distribution. And those margins, we think, compare very favorably to the industry overall. And in Electrical Systems & Services, I'd say, once again, that business performs very favorably. And I think it's really \u2013 you got to really think about the peers in the context of we play across the whole spectrum of electrical. Some of the peers that maybe you're referencing tend to be more niche. Maybe they're an electrical products business only or they're a components business only. But when you look at in aggregate against our primary peers, the ones who play across the whole spectrum in electrical, I would argue that our margins are as good or better than almost any of our competitors. And by the way, I would acknowledge that we're not done. We think we have opportunity that remains to continue to expand margins, and that's clearly what we expect to do. And we'll \u2013 as a part of our investor meeting in the first week of March, we'll provide some guidance around what we think the future outlook looks like. Markus Mittermaier : Sure. Great. That's very helpful. And then just briefly as a follow-up on aviation aftermarket OE, what was that split sort of in the \u2013 in Q4? And what's embedded in the guide for 2020 here? Craig Arnold : Yes, I'd say you can think about our business as 60-40, 60% OE, 40% aftermarket. And those numbers vary slightly depending upon what quarter you're talking about or what year you're talking about. But kind of the long-term view, a 60-40 split is generally where we're at. Markus Mittermaier : Great. Thank you very much. Craig Arnold : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question that will come from Mig Dobre with Baird. Please go ahead. Mig Dobre : Yes. Good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in and congrats on a good 2019. I wanted to go back to ESS as well and maybe ask a couple of things. On Power Distribution, can you give us some color on margin for that business? And then how do you think about the cadence of the segment's margin through the year, given that you've got some pretty difficult comps on incrementals in Q2 and Q3. Craig Arnold : Our power distribution margins inside of Electrical Systems & Services, I'd say, are largely in line with the segment overall. So I don't know that we see significant differences in the margins in power distribution assemblies overall, though, obviously, projects can impact that perhaps a little bit more than some of the other parts of the business. In terms of cadence, I mean this business always tends to be a little bit back-end loaded. And if you think about the company's split of revenue first half, second half, Electrical Systems & Services always tends to be a little bit of a back-end loaded business. And as a result, you get higher volume and higher margins in the second half of the year. And I think that's just very much consistent with what we've seen from this business over a very long period of time. Mig Dobre : Yes, Craig, just to clarify, I was talking about the acquisition, Power Distribution acquisition? Craig Arnold : PDI. Okay. Yes. PDI's margins, I would say, today are below the average for Electrical Systems & Services. We \u2013 obviously, we like the business. We like the space. We think we have an opportunity to clearly expand margins, but they do come into the company at slightly below the margins of the segment overall. Rick Fearon : And we'll make some improvement in terms of synergies this year, but probably more so in 2021 in PDI. Mig Dobre : Sure. And then lastly, on Hydraulics, just looking at your guidance, your margin guidance for 2020 and kind of comparing it to what we've seen exiting 2019. How do you think about the drivers for margin expansion here? And what's different going forward than what we've seen in 2019? Thank you. Craig Arnold : Yes. I think the answer in Hydraulics \u2013 and we've spent a lot of time over the last couple of years talking about the level of inefficiencies that we were driving in the Hydraulics business as we dealt with this pretty significant market ramp in the midst of a \u2013 perhaps the biggest restructuring program in the history of the business. And so as I mentioned in prior calls, we were kind of caught in the middle of doing this massive restructuring and movement of parts and pieces when the industry ramped. And we had a lot of inefficiencies that were in the business as we were halfway complete in terms of many of these restructuring programs. And so as we think about 2020 and where the improvement comes from, it's largely a function of getting these things completed and behind us. And we're very confident in our ability to deliver the margin guidance that we've laid out for Hydraulics. Mig Dobre : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you very much. The next question that will come from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Deane Dray : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Craig Arnold : Hi, Deane. Deane Dray : Just got a couple of quick ones here. First, when I look at the 2020 guidance, the organic revenue growth of minus 1 to plus 1 seems a bit tighter than I would have expected, just given the macro uncertainty. So maybe some \u2013 reflect on that, if you could. And is there any impact now with the recast portfolio earnings, better earnings consistency? Does that reduce some of the cyclicality, and might that explain some of the tighter range? Craig Arnold : Yes. I think the first thing, Deane, to your point, I mean, we agree, it's a fairly tight range, and we could have said approximately flat. There always is a fair amount of uncertainty, in general, in these businesses. And so I'd say I wouldn't overread at least for 2020 the fact that the range is minus 1 to plus 1 other than to say that we think our markets are going to be approximately flat for the year, is really the right way to think about that. And to your point, lots of uncertainty, we'll see how the year unfolds, but that's really where we've landed at as an organization. I do think, to your point, though, as we go forward, once we get beyond 2020 into 2021 and we get Hydraulics divested, there's no question that there'll be a lot more earnings and revenue consistency inside of the organization when you go forward. And so very much consistent with the strategy that we laid out around driving better consistency of earnings, Hydraulics will help tremendously in that regard. Deane Dray : Great. And then\u2026 Craig Arnold : I wouldn't overread the minus 1 to plus 1. Deane Dray : Good. I promise not to overread. And then just last question would be, it's interesting how many questions you've had today on data center. Obviously, some of it from Network Power acquisition. But what do you make of the new ownership of the former Emerson Network Power? And does that change, in any way, expectations about some of the competitive dynamics, maybe some more price competition? Be interested in your thoughts there. Craig Arnold : No. I mean, I'd say, appreciate the question, Deane, and I could \u2013 I know Dave Cote well. I used to work for him, by the way. So it's \u2013 I can imagine that he will certainly bring some strong leadership to that business. But no, we'd say, we love our position in data centers. Today, if you think about where we play, and first of all, we don't overlap completely with Vertiv, I mean we play in, in some \u2013 many cases, different parts of the market than they do. But we think we're clearly number one or number two in the world depending upon where you're at in data centers. We like our strategic position there. We think at the end of the day, competition is good. It will make us all better. But we like our position in data centers, and we think we're well positioned. We think we continue to do extraordinarily well in that market. And so no, we don't think it changes the competitive dynamic at all. Deane Dray : Thank you. Yan Jin : Good. Thank you all. We have reached the end of the call, and we do appreciate everybody's questions. As always, Chip and I will be available to follow-up. Thank you all for joining us today. Operator : Thank you very much. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference call for today. We do thank you for your participation and for using AT&T's conferencing service.

Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded. I\u2019d now like to turn the conference over to your host, Yan Jin, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Yan Jin : Good morning. I\u2019m Yan Jin, Eaton\u2019s Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you all for joining us today for Eaton\u2019s first quarter 2020 earnings call. I hope that you and your families stay healthy and also stay safe, right? With me today are Craig Arnold, our Chairman and CEO; and Rick Fearon, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial and Planning Officer. Our agenda today, including opening remarks by Craig, highlighting the company\u2019s performance in the first quarter. As we have done in our past calls, we\u2019ll be taking questions at the end of Craig\u2019s comments. The press release and the presentation we\u2019ll go through today have been posted on our website at www.eaton.com. Please note that both the press release and the presentation include reconciliations to non-GAAP measures. A webcast of this call is accessible on our website and will be available for replay. I would like to remind you that our comments today will including statements related to expected future results of the company and are, therefore, forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our forecasted projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and presentation. They\u2019re also outlined in our related 8-K filing. With that, I will turn it over to Craig. Craig Arnold : Thanks, Yan. Appreciate it. Let me start on Page 3, and I\u2019d like to begin by providing an overview of how Eaton is addressing the impact of COVID-19 with our key stakeholders, our employees, our customers, our shareholders and certainly our communities in general. Yes. The first thing I\u2019d say is I couldn\u2019t be more pleased with how well our team is managing through the crisis. As always, the safety of our employee has been and continues to be our top priority. Most of you are very familiar by now with the best practices around eliminating the spread of COVID-19. At Eaton, we\u2019ve adopted them all, and I\u2019d say that most of them, even before they were commonplace. We learned from what we saw in China. We activated and stood up our pandemic management and response team early and created a COVID-19 playbook. This playbook has become part of the Eaton business system and it specifies exactly what we expect of our factories and offices around the world, including how we ensure compliance. We also continue to serve customers around the world. As you\u2019re aware, most of our products have been deemed to be a critical part of the global infrastructure. And as a result, our factories remain open with very few exceptions. We are, however, seeing lower utilization and weak demand in some of our end markets. And so we have had some temporary closures in a couple of facilities. And I\u2019d also note that organic growth continues to be our top priority. We want to make sure that we\u2019re well positioned to take advantage of all opportunities, including the increases in expenditures on government infrastructure when it comes, and we do think it\u2019s coming. And I\u2019m especially proud of the work that our employees are doing around the world to support our communities and caregivers. We\u2019ve donated Eaton equipment. We\u2019re using our additive manufacturing capabilities to produce personal protective equipment, and we\u2019ve increased our charitable giving to support those impacted by COVID-19. And finally, as I\u2019ll detail in the next couple of slides, we\u2019re also taking the appropriate cost reduction and cash management actions to ensure solid decremental profit margins, strong liquidity and cash flow. Allow me to begin with liquidity and cash flow on Page 4, and both are actually in great shape. As of March 31, we had $450 million of cash and short-term investments on hand and access to $2 billion of undrawn multiyear bank facilities. In fact, we\u2019ve never drawn on our bank facilities, and we don\u2019t expect to use them during 2020. We have been in touch with our bankers and are comfortable with our ability rack [ph] system if needed. We also have access to the commercial paper market, obviously. In 2020, we do have one relatively small debt maturity of $240 million, which is due at the end of Q4. As a point of reference, I\u2019ve noted at the end of March that our debt to adjusted trailing 12 month EBITDA was only 2.1 times. And in terms of cash flow, we\u2019re updating our 2020 guidance, as you saw. And we expect now free cash flow to be in the range of $2.3 billion to $2.7 billion with a midpoint of $2.5 billion. And I think while this is lower than our original forecast, it represents strong performance and shows our resilient cash flow in whatever economic environment we find ourselves in. Our cash flow is more than sufficient to continue to invest in the business and to maintain our dividend. Many of you may not be aware, but Eaton has paid a dividend for nearly 100 years, and we don\u2019t see any scenario in which that would change. As planned, during Q1, we repurchased $1.3 billion of our shares using the proceeds from the Lighting sale. And as you\u2019re also aware, we expect to receive $3.3 billion of cash from the sale of Hydraulics by the end of the year, leaving us with much higher liquidity and even lower leverage. So with a strong balance sheet, our optionality for additional share repurchase and M&A really remains intact. We continue to think that our stock provides a very attractive return given the 3.4% dividend yield and a free cash flow yield of more than 7%. We\u2019re equally focused on ensuring that we deliver attractive decremental margins is one of our top priorities, and we\u2019ve moved quickly to put cost containment measures in place. We summarized some of these actions on Page 5. First, the first reduction was really the one taken by our leadership team, and they took the first and the biggest cut, 25% to 50% reduction in base salaries in Q2. And our Board of Directors also agreed to a 50% reduction in their cash retainer for Q2, and these funds will actually go into an employee relief fund for those impacted by COVID-19. These actions are in place for Q2, but then they could be extended if the forecast of recovery comes later than expected. We\u2019ve also dramatically reduced discretionary expenses, put in place hiring freezes for all but a few critical roles, and a number of other actions that include unpaid leave for most of our salaried workforce. We delayed the planned 2020 merit increase until next year. And we\u2019ve taken a significant reduction, as you can imagine, or the elimination of incentive compensation. All difficult but necessary steps as we work to ensure that we approach the challenge with shared sacrifice, with those of us with the greatest needs naturally shouldering a bigger piece of responsibility or burden. Lastly, we\u2019ve eliminated nonessential CapEx. And as you\u2019ll see in the updated CapEx guidance in a few slides, it\u2019s a pretty significant reduction. Let me say that while the pandemic is new for all of us, Eaton has managed through severe economic declines in the past. And quite frankly, we\u2019ve always emerged as a stronger company. It\u2019s something that we fully expect to do this time around. Moving to Page 6. I\u2019ll turn to our traditional set of charts, our quarterly results. Q1 earnings per share, where as you saw, $1.07 on a GAAP basis and $1.09, excluding the $0.02 charge for acquisition and divestitures. Adjusted earnings per share were reduced by an estimate of $0.14 due to the impact of COVID-19. This is a bit more than the $0.10 impact that we\u2019ve estimated in early March as the impact of COVID-19 really spread beyond China into the rest of the world. Our sales of $4.8 billion were down 7% organically, which includes a 3% decline that we anticipated in our original guidance or an additional 4% or $200 million impact from COVID-19. And this is some $50 million more than we estimated in early March. And you\u2019ll recall that at our March two investor meeting, we indicated that revenue shortfall of COVID-19 would be approximately $150 million. Segment margins were 15.8%, down slightly from Q1 2019. But I\u2019d also note that this includes additional and unplanned restructuring charges as we made the decision to begin to rightsize some of the businesses that are being heavily impacted by this economic downturn. Other notable events in the quarter. We announced the sale of the Hydraulics business to Danfoss for $3.3 billion, which we expect to close at the end of 2020. We closed the sale of Lighting for $1.4 billion. And we deployed $1.3 billion repurchased shares equal to 3.4% of our shares outstanding at the beginning of 2020. And on Page 7, we summarize our Q1 performance, and I\u2019ll just kind of note a few highlights here. First, we\u2019re changing our historical practice and are now recognizing all charges related to acquisitions and divestitures at corporate level rather than in the segment level. So the gain, for example, on Lighting would be at corporate, not in one of the segments. We think this makes it easier for you to forecast and model our segments as well as the overall company. Second, during Q1, acquisitions increased sales by 2%, which was more than offset by a 3.5% impact from divestitures. Negative currency also lowered sales by 1.5%. Finally, our team continued to actively manage costs, and this is what enabled us to deliver decremental margins of 17% in the quarter. So we see, once again, this is a very strong set of results in this particular environment. Moving to Page 8. We have the quarterly summary of our new Electrical Americas segment. Revenues were down 9%, a 2% decline in organic revenues as a result of COVID-19 and a 6% decline from the divestiture of Lighting. And negative currency impacted sales by 1%. As you can see noted on the chart, if you exclude Lighting and the COVID-19 impact, organic revenues were up 2%. Strength in Q1 was driven by commercial construction and the utility end markets. Operating margins increased by 20 basis points to 17.2%, and this is mostly due to the favorable impact from the divestiture of the Lighting business in early March. Excluding Lighting, orders were up 3% on a rolling 12-month basis. So pretty decent orders overall. Given the resegmentation, which combines Electrical Products and Electrical Systems & Services into Americas, we\u2019re now reporting orders on a 12-month rolling basis going forward. And this will also be true for the Electrical Global segment. In the quarter, we saw strength in data centers and utility and residential markets really offset by weakness in industrial markets. Next on Page 9, we have our Q1 results for the Electrical Global segment. Revenues were down 8%, with a 6% decline organically. And this entire decline was driven by the impact of COVID-19 and most of this really coming out of China. We also have 1% growth from the Ulusoy acquisition and a negative currency impact of 3%. Operating margins declined 80 basis points to 14.5%. And I point out that this number does include increased restructuring charges that were not planned that we\u2019re taking in this segment. Orders declined 1% here on a rolling 12-month basis. In the quarter itself, we saw significant growth in data centers. And this was more than offset by decline, as you would imagine, in global oil and gas markets. On Page 10, we summarize our Hydraulics segment. You\u2019ll recall that with the resegmentation announced in March, this segment now includes only the Hydraulics business. Filtration and Golf Grip are now reported as a part of the Aerospace segment. I\u2019d emphasize once again that we continue to expect the sale of this business to Danfoss to close at the end of 2020, a very strategic deal for them, and things look like they\u2019re remaining on track. For Q1, revenues were down 16%, the 14% organic decline, and this number includes an estimated 3% decline due to COVID-19 and negative currency impact of 2%. Operating margins improved 100 basis points to 10.8%, and orders for the quarter were down 11% year-over-year and driven really by continued weakness in global mobile equipment market. Moving to Page 11, we summarize our results for the Aerospace segment. Revenues were up 13% with negative 1% organic growth. We estimate 3% of this decline due to COVID-19, and certainly, we saw a 14% increase as a result of the acquisition of Souriau. Operating margins declined 110 basis points to 21.6%, so still very strong, and this decline was primarily due to the acquisition of Souriau, which obviously came in at lower margins in the underlying business. Organic orders declined 1% on a rolling 12-month basis. And in the quarter, we saw strength in military fighters and military aftermarket, but particular weakness, as you can imagine, in commercial transport. Turning to Page 12. We look at our vehicle segment. Revenues here declined 26%, which 20% was organic. Included in the organic revenue decline, we estimated that COVID-19 had a negative impact of some 5%. In addition, the divestiture of the Automotive Fluid Conveyance business impacted revenue by 4% and we had a 2% negative impact from currency. I\u2019d say here that the largest part of Q1 revenue decline was expected, and it\u2019s really the result of lower Class eight OEM production, which was down some 31%. And continued weakness in global light vehicle markets where production was down from 21%. As noted, operating margins declined 160 basis points to 13.5%. I\u2019d also point out here is despite a significant reduction in volume, decremental margins were less than 20% as our team continued to proactively manage both discretionary and fixed costs. Given COVID-19, we now expect NAFTA Class eight production to be 180,000 units, down from our original forecast of 230,000 units, nearly 50% lower than 2019. And the last segment is eMobility on Page 13. Here, revenues were down 13%, with organic revenues down 12%, including an estimated 4% impact with COVID-19, and we had a 1% impact from negative currency. Operating margins declined to 1.4%, and this is a result of volume reduction on legacy internal combustion engine platforms as well as manufacturing start-up costs associated with new wins on electric vehicle program. And lastly, we summarize our Q2 and 2020 outlook on Page 14, and I\u2019ll begin by stating that due to the economic uncertainty from the COVID-19 pandemic, we\u2019re withdrawing our full year 2020 guidance. I wish we were in a position to provide revenue forecast but we just don\u2019t have that level of clarity at the moment. I would add that for the month of April, month-to-date revenues are running down approximately 30%. And inside of that 30%, obviously, electrical would be better than that number and some of the more impacted businesses of vehicle and aerospace will be running slightly worse than that. But I would expect the month of May and June to be somewhat stronger, but clearly, it\u2019s too early to tell for certain. We do have better visibility on decremental margins and free cash flow in our guidance, as depicted. We\u2019re targeting decremental margins of 30% for Q2 and 25% to 30% for the full year. Like prior downturns, we\u2019re extraordinarily focused on cost control. We\u2019ve taken a number of cost control actions already. And importantly, we have contingency plans in place to do more if needed. We do expect decremental margins to be higher in Q2. This is the quarter where we\u2019d expect, quite frankly, the largest volume impact as well as the quarter that we\u2019ll see the biggest restructuring charge. Our CapEx forecast for the year is now approximately $40 million, down from our prior guidance of $550 million. And our free cash flow guidance now at $2.3 billion to $2.7 billion, $2.5 billion at the midpoint. So we continue to expect free cash flow conversion to remain strong. And we\u2019re also maintaining our dividend, which we increased by 3% in February. Let me just close by saying that while we recognize that the kind of the overall uncertainty created by COVID-19 and its economic impact, as a company, we remain focused on generating strong cash flow, which we\u2019ve always done. We\u2019re focused on implementing our long-term strategy around how we transform Eaton into a company that delivers, over the long term, higher growth, higher margins and certainly more consistent earnings. So with those opening comments, I will stop here, and I\u2019ll turn it over back to Yan for Q&A. Yan Jin : Thanks, Craig. Before we begin our Q&A session of the call today, I do see that we have a number of individuals in the queue with questions. So given our time constraint for only an hour today, please limit your opportunity to only one question and one follow-up. Thank you in the ones for your corporation. With that, I will turn it over to the operator who will give you guys instruction. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is going to come from the line of Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research. Please go ahead. Jeff Sprague : Craig, I was wondering if you could address in a little more detail the specific actions you\u2019re taking to manage decrementals. In other words, you gave us some color on the employee actions and compensation. How much of that is temporary? And how do you see that kind of rolling through? And kind of the related follow-up, maybe that I\u2019ll just ask right now, is you mentioned restructuring a couple of times, too, right? So that sounds a little bit more structural and permanent. So can you just unpack those two items and give us a little more color on how to kind of get our head around those? Craig Arnold : Yes, Jeff, thank you. I appreciate the question. Maybe I\u2019ll just begin by saying that, as you\u2019re well aware, we have really spent as a company in excess of $500 million over the last three or four years to really get at structural and fixed cost inside of our company. And those benefits are certainly playing through in our business today around better profitability at every point in kind of in the economic window that we deal with. And as you\u2019re aware as well, Jeff, we don\u2019t like other companies, today, we run restructuring through our P&L. And we - every year, we\u2019re spending order of magnitude, $60 million to $70 million worth of restructuring. And those restructuring programs are generally targeted at structural costs, costs that go away and don\u2019t come back independent of what happens on the economic front. And so we continue to have a playbook around restructuring opportunities. And as we discussed in the past, as we think about managing through periods where we have economic weakness, we have programs that are on the shelf that we can simply slide in and do a little bit more restructuring in periods where we find ourselves facing more economic weakness than we anticipate. And so as we think about those businesses inside of our company that are dealing with perhaps more structural and longer-term downturns as a result of COVID-19, what you\u2019re going to find is that we\u2019ll, in all likelihood, accelerate and pull in some of those restructuring initiatives to once again deal with fixed costs in those businesses. And so at this point, as I mentioned, we will continue to run it through the P&L, and it\u2019s one of the things that we think is important as you think about the company itself and looking at, on a comparison basis, we think it\u2019s just part of running the business and that stuff that we\u2019re focused on, on an ongoing basis. Jeff Sprague : So to be clear, though, so you\u2019re just spending the normal $50 million to $70 million or there\u2019s an elevated amount? Craig Arnold : We are spending - we did in Q1, and we would expect to, for the full year, to spend an elevated amount. And that was part of the reason we\u2019ve called out even in our Q1 results that we did spend additional restructuring, more restructuring dollars than planned. And - but for that restructuring, obviously, our results would have been even stronger. Jeff Sprague : Right. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is going to come from the line of Deane Dray from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Deane Dray : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Craig Arnold : Hi, Deane. Deane Dray : I appreciate all the color today given limited visibility. You\u2019re actually stepping up and giving the free cash flow guidance, which is pretty impressive. For the comment on April being down 30%, since you\u2019ve shown the ability to separate how much you think the COVID-19 impact is for this first quarter, how much of April are you attributing to the April being down 30%? How much are you attributing that to COVID-19? Craig Arnold : I mean, I think it\u2019s - we\u2019ll probably be in a better position to really parse that as we get to the end of the quarter. But Deane, from where we sit today, there\u2019s no reason to assume that 100% of that reduction isn\u2019t tied to COVID-19. I mean, I think if you take a look at how the company was performing prior to kind of COVID-19, and quite frankly, prior to becoming a pandemic and hitting the rest of the world. The company was actually performing quite well, and we were in very good shape. And so there\u2019s absolutely no reason for us to believe that 100% of that reduction isn\u2019t tied to COVID-19. As you\u2019re well aware, as governments around the world have shut down economies and some of our customers have closed factories, all of that is really tied to COVID-19. Deane Dray : That\u2019s helpful. And Craig, I was interested in having you expand on your comment that your degree of confidence that there is going to be increased government spending coming on the infrastructure side. We\u2019ve certainly seen this before. And just on an early look, how do you think you all are positioned? Any particular businesses that you think would benefit the most? Craig Arnold : Yes. I appreciate the questions, Deane. What I\u2019d say is that we\u2019re getting ready. I mean, we\u2019ve been here before. We have a playbook that we\u2019ve created as a result of living through, whether it\u2019s been hurricanes or other kind of events where we today have an organization that we\u2019ve set up to really be prepared to deal with these economic stimulus plans as they come. We do believe, and we\u2019ll have to wait and see when it comes, we\u2019re starting to see kind of the early signs of it in China. We think the U.S. will eventually have an infrastructure spending plan, and it will certainly benefit our company immensely, certainly, with most of those benefits coming in our core electrical business. But at this point, it\u2019s early, but we\u2019re getting ready. Deane Dray : Great. And just lastly, a comment. I don\u2019t know if your ears were burning, but WESCO in the last call just had really nice things to say about Eaton\u2019s manufacturing, precision and keeping the supply chain full for them in terms of having as a vendor. So congrats to you and the team. Craig Arnold : Thank you. Appreciate that. We have a very strong partnership with WESCO and with all of our distributors and we\u2019re doing everything we can to keep them up and running. Operator : Thank you. Our next question then will come from the line of Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Joe Ritchie : Hey, thank you. Good morning, everyone. I hope you guys are all well. Maybe just starting off, Craig, I\u2019m just thinking about the restructuring plans like temporary versus structural, it sounds like a lot of the plans that you outlined today seem more temporary in nature. I don\u2019t want to put words in your mouth, but - so maybe you can address that. And then secondly, why would now be like a more opportune time to maybe accelerate some of the footprint rationalization plan that you\u2019ve talked about in the past? Craig Arnold : Yeah. I appreciate the question, Joe. The way we think about restructuring in general, so any time we talk about restructuring, we\u2019re, for the most part, always talking about structural changes. I mean, one of the things that we would expect each of our businesses to do and as well as what we do in our support function is that we have to flex our businesses. And so as volume changes, there\u2019s a natural expectation and mechanism for us to flex our support costs, our manufacturing costs as economic levels go up and down. And restructuring, for us, really is focused on making structural changes to the company. And to your point, looking at things like the manufacturing footprint, the structural footprint, where we do work in different places around the world. And what - the only thing I would say about that is that, clearly, we have a plan that we were focused on executing in 2020. We\u2019ve already made a decision to accelerate some of those items and do more in 2020 than we originally anticipated. We would never intend to get out in front of our internal communication plans around what we would intend to do by making announcements. But I will tell you, though, in the event that this economic contraction goes on longer or is worse than we anticipated, we have the ability to accelerate and pull in more ideas. So right now, we have a plan that we\u2019ve laid out. We\u2019re doing more than what we originally anticipated. And we feel good about the fact that we can accelerate that and do even more if the environment calls for it. Joe Ritchie : That\u2019s helpful, Craig. Maybe to that end, right, you guys have outlined decremental margins of 30% in the second quarter, 25% to 30% for the year. So there\u2019s got to be some type of scenario planning that\u2019s going on as well. So I guess my question is what kind of downturn are you guys thinking about for a kind of 25% to 30% type decremental for the year? And at what point, if things are actually worse than you anticipate, do those decrementals turn out to be a little bit higher than where we are today? Craig Arnold : Yes. And I\u2019d say that what we said is that we\u2019re living in an environment right now where we just don\u2019t have enough certainty and clarity around our markets to provide guidance. And as you\u2019ve seen, many of our customers are not providing guidance either. So tough for us to provide guidance when the customers aren\u2019t willing to kind of weigh in and put a stake in the ground either. And so what I would say today is that you can rest assure that we have done scenario planning. We\u2019ve done scenario planning with respect to not only what the decrementals look like, what does cash flow look like. And I would tell you, first of all, on the cash flow under every scenario, our cash flows remained strong. In fact, in many cases, as we continue to liquidate working capital, that would even improve under certain conditions. But with respect to the forecast and in the range of possibilities, at this point, we\u2019re not going to provide kind of the guidance, but rest assured that we when we have an internal plan that lays out a number of different possibilities. We do believe that Q2 will be the weakest quarter. But in the event that, that downturn, that being longer or more protracted than we\u2019re currently forecasting, we have the ability to do more. And we hopefully will be in a position as we get to the end of Q2 to give you a better indication of what the year is going to look like. So I know that probably doesn\u2019t answer your question directly, Joe, because we\u2019re just not in a position to give you kind of a view of kind of revenue for the year. But hopefully, we\u2019re maybe 60 days away from being able to do so. Operator : Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Scott Davis [Melius Research] Please go ahead. Scott Davis : Hi. Good morning, Craig and Rick. Craig Arnold : Hi. Richard Fearon : Morning, Scott. Scott Davis : I appreciate the color. I think one of the things I\u2019d like to get a sense of, I mean, we know your big distributors are healthy, but what\u2019s the sense of your smaller distributors and their financial health? Craig Arnold : Yes. At this point, Scott, I\u2019d say that we don\u2019t anticipate at this juncture any distributor kind of issues as we work through kind of this downturn. As you know, one of the good things about being deemed essential by most governments around the world is that mostly, our distributors continued to deliver goods and services and projects continue to be executed. They certainly will be impacted like everybody else. But at this juncture, I\u2019d say it\u2019s - we\u2019ve not seen any material change in the health of most of our distributors. We\u2019re obviously monitoring it closely. But at this juncture, there\u2019s nothing that we could really add that would really suggest that the smaller distributors are going to be somehow imperiled as a result of this particular economic downturn. Richard Fearon : Scott, it\u2019s Rick. I might add that as I look at the payments from these distributors, we haven\u2019t seen any significant deterioration in the days that they\u2019re paying their invoices in. Scott Davis : Okay. That\u2019s super helpful. And then as a follow-up, I just think when I think about our model that the toughest one to forecast is probably Aerospace because I would imagine your decremental margins here could be a bit higher than the average that you\u2019re calling out, just based really on the older planes are going to get parked or already being parked. And do you have any confidence? Is there - can you internally model it and feel comfortable at least that the decrementals can be somewhat in the ballpark of what you\u2019re forecasting broader? Or should we expect something a little bit bigger? Craig Arnold : No, I mean, look, I appreciate the question, Scott, but I mean just to be extraordinarily clear, we have absolutely modeled what we would anticipate the year to look like. So embedded in those assumptions around what the decrementals look like for Q2, what the decrementals look like for the full year, we\u2019ve absolutely modeled what we think the range of possibilities for the year would be. And that\u2019s why we\u2019ve given a range in terms of decrementals for the year. Q2 will clearly be the most challenging quarter, and we\u2019re talking about a 30% decremental in Q2, which will be, for all intents and purposes, not a very attractive quarter, right, in terms of all the governments that have shut down activity around the world. And so even in that quarter, we\u2019re saying we think we can deliver a 30% decremental. We think the decrementals for the year can be better than that because we think the back half is better than Q2 is going to be. But we absolutely have a plan that we\u2019ve modeled. And you\u2019re absolutely correct. The decrementals in Aerospace would be higher than the decrementals in some of the other businesses. But on balance, we\u2019re very comfortable, very comfortable with the range of possibilities that we laid out. Scott Davis : Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. best of luck of guys. Craig Arnold : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And we\u2019re going to have a question from the line of Ann Duignan from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Ann Duignan : Hi, good morning. Thank you. Maybe you could give us some more details on the data center performance in both of the electrical businesses. Can you quantify the size of the business or quantify the growth that you saw in the quarter versus the fall off in some of the other weaker areas like oil and gas, just to help us think about modeling longer term, like, strength in data centers continuing maybe weakness in something like five times continuing beyond Q2. So any help you can give us would be gratefully appreciated. Craig Arnold : I think you just did a great job, Ann, of hitting the two outliers because certainly, on the positive side, data center orders were quite strong in the quarter, up, let\u2019s say, mid-double-digit in the quarter. So very strong performance in the data center market. And I think the data center market continues to be strong. And if anything, kind of work from home, the use of technology at home and the use of data in general, I think it just, once again, strengthens the case for the long-term growth prospects for the data center market in general. And so we are very pleased with our own performance in data centers in the quarter. And we\u2019d expected that market to remain quite attractive even in the midst of this economic downturn. On the other side of the equation, as you appropriately noted, the oil and gas markets are certainly being hit pretty hard by what\u2019s going on today by certainly the extraordinarily low oil prices and most of the major companies reducing their capital spending. And we\u2019re obviously experiencing those reductions as well. But I do think those are kind of the two bookends if you think about today what\u2019s going on inside of our core electrical business. And by the way, that pattern is pretty much true, whether you\u2019re looking at what\u2019s happening in the U.S. or you look at what\u2019s happening in markets outside of the U.S. Ann Duignan : And would you like to size the decline in orders and price times for us, just as you did the data center upside? Craig Arnold : Yes. I\u2019d say it\u2019s bigger. And if you think about today, we talked about sales specifically in terms of what we experienced in the month of April when I talked about the fact that sales are down, the order of magnitude in April is some 30%. And some businesses are worse than that, some are better than that. I would say Crouse-Hinds would be in the category of where we\u2019re seeing more weakness than average inside of the company. Richard Fearon : But Ann, it\u2019s also useful to factor in that coming into this COVID downturn, only about 30% of Crouse was oil and gas. So that\u2019s a reduction from what it had been at the time of the Cooper acquisition. Craig Arnold : Yes, we never really saw the market recover to the levels that it was at, at the time we acquired Cooper. So you\u2019re absolutely right, Rick. The impact on the company is less than it would have been, let\u2019s say, four or five years ago. We\u2019re totally seeing project delays. And the project delays that we\u2019ve seen to date really happened, particularly, in the oil and gas market. We haven\u2019t, quite frankly, seen significant cancellations at this point, but we have in fact seen delays. Ann Duignan : Okay, thank you. I\u2019ll leave there. I appreciate it. Craig Arnold : Thank you. Operator : Then our next question is going to come from the line of Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Nigel Coe : Hi, guys. Good morning, gents. Obviously, nice quarter. I\u2019m wondering, can you maybe just talk about the Hydraulic sale? What kind of progress can you be able to make in terms of getting the deal closed or moving through the process, given the sharper home restrictions around the globe? And maybe just update us in terms of next major steps and timing of the close. Thanks. Craig Arnold : Yes. I\u2019d say that we\u2019re certainly confident, as we talk about, that the deal will close. As we announced earlier, we do expect the deal to close at the end of the year. In late January, we did file the purchase agreement as a material contract with the SEC. And as you can see in the contract, the buyer doesn\u2019t really have outs for financing or regulatory issues. But I think even more importantly than that, we\u2019re very much in touch with the team at Danfoss. And strategically, this makes as much sense for them today as it did in the beginning. And they\u2019re doing everything that they can to accelerate the closure of the transaction as well. And so they remain very much still strategically committed to the deal and to the merits of the deal and still believe it will be extraordinarily beneficial to them, both in the near and in the long term. It remains a very strong strategic fit for Danfoss overall. Obviously, you have to go through the regulatory approval process, which we\u2019re working through now. And at this point, all we can tell you is that we fully expect this deal to close, and the current estimate is by the end of the year. And at this point, we\u2019ll have to wait and see to what extent, if anything, does COVID-19 impact it from a regulatory approval process. There\u2019s been no indication of that to date. But from where we sit, everything remains on track. Nigel Coe : That\u2019s great to hear, Craig. And then my follow-on question is really on the footprint. And you\u2019ve been very open about the fact that Eaton\u2019s footprint obviously made great progress but still not optimal at this point. But would you use this crisis and this slowdown to accelerate some of those footprint plans as you reposition coming out of this recession? Craig Arnold : Yes. And the way I\u2019d answer that question, Nigel, at this juncture, I\u2019d say that option is there. And depending upon the shape of the downturn, the depth of the downturn and the recovery, we obviously have the ability to pull forward restructuring programs, to pull forward some of the plans that we\u2019ve kind of thought through around how we could restructure the company. As we\u2019ve said as well, we\u2019ll clearly make those announcements internally with our organization before we would talk about it externally. So from where we sit today, we have a fairly - a plan that we\u2019re fairly comfortable with using the assumptions that we outlined with respect to the company. And - but those options are clearly there, and we feel confident that in the event that we needed to, we could accelerate some of these restructuring actions. Nigel Coe : That\u2019s great color. Thank you very much and best of luck. Craig Arnold : Thanks. Operator : Then our next question will come from the line of Andrew Oldman from Bank of America. Please go ahead. David Ridley-Lane: Sure. This is David Ridley-Lane on for Andrew. Can you maybe size the benefit of the restructuring actions you took in first quarter? And I guess, broadly, are these sort of in the timeline of a one year payback? Craig Arnold : Yes. One of the things that we\u2019ve made the decision appreciate the question, but we did make the decision a couple of years ago that as a company, we undertake restructuring every year. And we thought that it would be better served, and you would be better served that if these are going to be ongoing restructuring programs, things that we do systematically every year to deal with structural costs that we don\u2019t call them out as onetime items because we do anticipate doing them on an ongoing basis. And as I mentioned in my opening commentary, we size that normally at order of magnitude, $60 million to $70 million a year. Clearly, we\u2019re going to do more this year. But once again, what we intend to do is to run it through our operations and not to call it out as a separate onetime item. Now if we ever got to the point where we had to do a very large sizable plan over multiple years, we would perhaps consider taking a different pattern than that. But as long as it\u2019s kind of in the ordinary course of the way we\u2019re running the company or if it\u2019s on the margin, it\u2019s not a significant departure from what we\u2019ve spent historically, we would intend to just run it through operations. David Ridley-Lane: Okay. And then are lower raw material costs going to be a meaningful benefit for you in 2020 on the gross margin line? Craig Arnold : Yes, we absolutely would hope so. And certainly, we have experienced to date that most of the key raw materials that we acquire, whether that\u2019s copper, aluminum, silver, steel prices have certainly turned favorable so far this year. And in many cases, as we\u2019ve talked about over the years, the way we really think about commodity cost in general is that they\u2019re neither a net drag or net positive to earnings. To the extent that costs are going up, we intend to pass those costs on to customers in the marketplace. And to the extent that they come down, the expectation is that over time, they would also come down as well. And so we\u2019re clearly seeing lower commodity prices today. But once again, the way we think about it over the long term is that it\u2019s not a net negative nor a net positive in terms of EPS. David Ridley-Lane: Thank you very much. Craig Arnold : Thank you. Operator : Then our next question is going to come from the line of John Inch from Gordon Haskett. Please go ahead. John Inch : Thank you. Good morning, everybody. I got dropped, unfortunately, earlier. So I hopefully am not going over something you\u2019ve already covered, Craig and Rick. But wondering if we can talk a little bit about the puts and takes on cash flow and maybe working capital. I\u2019m presuming the shift from two nine to two five, the preponderance of that is just the lower earnings expectation. That said, I mean, how much working capital would you guys expect to release to kind of buffer cash this year? And secondly, on cash conversion, do you expect the cash conversion numbers on adjusted income to go higher? I\u2019m assuming so. Any sense of how much higher those could fall out this year? Richard Fearon : Yes, I\u2019d be happy to address your questions, John. First of all, just a few data points to consider. If you think about our classic working capital, receivables, inventory, less payables, it\u2019s about 19% of sales. And so as sales come down, you pull out that working capital. At the same time, as we\u2019ve commented in the past, we came into this year with inventory levels above what they should have been. And we\u2019ve commented that as much as $300 million to $400 million higher than they should have been. And so what you\u2019re looking at is a situation now that future activity has fallen off, there is a real imperative and a real push within the company to pull down inventories in particular. Just to give you an order of magnitude, if DOH at the end of March was the same as DOH at the end of 2019, our inventories would have been $400 million lower. And so the biggest opportunity is in DOH. The second opportunity is in receivables, where we\u2019re actually managing that pretty well. But we\u2019ve - as is normally the case in a downturn, they pushed out a day to 2, and we have every confidence that we will pull that back in. We\u2019re working very hard at that. And then on days payables, we have made progress and came in a little bit better than planned in March, and we believe that we can make further progress there. I was just going to say another perspective I think that\u2019s helpful is that if you looked at our free cash flow in \u201808 and \u201809, let\u2019s just look at history, from \u201808 to \u201809, our free cash flow improved 22%. If you looked at 2015 to 2016, again, another down market, our free cash flow was up 9%. And those improvements really were working capital related, liquidating working capital to offset the decline in profits. But at the same time, also it\u2019s managing decrementals. And the decrementals that we had in \u201808 and \u201809 were pretty attractive. They were a decremental of down 24% in \u201808 and \u201809. And in fact, in 2015 to 2016, the decremental was only down 19%. So it\u2019s a combination of managing decrementals and pulling working capital out. And to your last question, John, typically, your cash conversion ratio improves in these kinds of downturns due to the amount of working capital that you liquidate. And so we would expect that we would do much better on our free cash conversion in 2020 compared to 2019. John Inch : That makes sense. And would you say, Rick, the inventories of the 300 to 400 excess that you had, are they kind of more at an equilibrium as you closed out the quarter? I guess it\u2019s kind of a bit of a falling knife in terms of the future, right? Richard Fearon : Yes, that\u2019s the problem. John Inch : Did it get burned off much of that? Richard Fearon : No. Not much. Not much. And then we had future sales fall off. And so this is something we\u2019re working really, really hard. And I think we\u2019ll make a lot of progress in Q2. I don\u2019t know that we\u2019ll get it entirely back to where we like by the end of Q2. But if the world begins to improve, as most forecasters think in Q3 and Q4, we will continue to constrain adding inventory back as volume starts rising. Craig Arnold : And I\u2019d only add that just the way the quarter unfolded, most of our businesses outside of China were doing just sign up until mid-March. And so this really - we saw this fall off in the last two weeks of the quarter, which is what\u2019s driven some of this excess inventory and our ability to get it out. It just takes time. And so if you think about it, in general, if you have 90 days\u2019 worth of inventory, you\u2019re about 90 days away from fixing an inventory problem. John Inch : No. Totally makes sense. And just one more quick one. Craig, at the analyst meeting, you alluded to abundant supply chain efficiency or cost-saving opportunities. And I\u2019m just wondering if the past few weeks has provided the backdrop to kind of review those opportunities. Perhaps would we ever see and perhaps establish maybe some formal targets or initiatives or any of that kind of being communicated? Craig Arnold : I\u2019m sorry, say, supply chain, you said specifically? And when you say supply chain, you mean? John Inch : Yes, around your - that\u2019s right, around your supply chain. I think at the analyst meeting, it wasn\u2019t part of your presentation, but someone asked you about supply chain and you made a comment. No, there\u2019s actually quite a lot of opportunity, efficiency opportunities. I\u2019m just curious if that\u2019s become a topic during the downturn as an opportunity. Craig Arnold : I\u2019d tell you, in general, we do believe there are large opportunities within the supply chain and things that we\u2019re doing across the company to bring more visibility and to leverage the scale of the company more effectively across the enterprise. And those initiatives are ongoing and have been ongoing. And I\u2019d say that in the context of an economic downturn, there\u2019s obviously a greater sense of urgency around everything, and I would put that into the same bucket of where we have opportunities to accelerate the ways in which we\u2019re leveraging the scale of the company. It\u2019s just getting a lot more attention during the economic downturn. But that - I would put that in the category of kind of the ongoing continuous improvement around the way we\u2019re running the company. John Inch : Makes sense. Thanks very much. Craig Arnold : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is going to come from the line of John Walsh from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. John Walsh : Hi, good morning. Craig Arnold : Morning. John Walsh : I guess a quick one. You highlighted your strong liquidity position. You mentioned share repurchase, acquisitions. Should we think that actions like that are on hold until you close Hydraulics? Or can you actually - or would you actually do something before that? Craig Arnold : Yes. And what I\u2019d say, John, is as we think about kind of the first thing I would say is that typically, during economic downturns, there aren\u2019t a lot of transactions done in general as valuations tend to decline, and it takes a while for the reality to set in, in terms of kind of what assets are worth. And so I would say that in general, you don\u2019t tend to find a lot of deals done during economic downturns for that reason. But I will tell you that as you look - and we continue to work the pipeline, and we continue to look at opportunities. I think practically speaking, from where we sit today, the kind of things that make the most sense for us tend to be the tuck-in type of transactions, and that\u2019s most of what we\u2019re looking at. But I would say, no, we think we have enough confidence in the cash flow of the company and enough confidence in that the transaction will close, that we certainly, if we needed to, if we found something that was really strategic at the right price, right, we would certainly we could take bridge loans. We can do things to finance the transaction. So we got to the point where the cash flow from, let\u2019s say, the sale of Hydraulics. And quite frankly, all the cash that we\u2019ll generate for the balance of this year came in. So that\u2019s kind of the way we think about it. It\u2019s really when that opportunity comes, we think we have enough financing flexibility to do a deal once again, recognizing that we\u2019re going to maintain our discipline. We\u2019re not going to overreach. We clearly feel like buying back our stock is certainly an option as well. And every deal has got to compete with that as an alternative. But no, if we found something that was really strategic, at the right price, we would certainly have enough financing flexibility to do it even in the near term. John Walsh : Great. And just I asked the question we\u2019ve heard some companies actually suspend or decide that they\u2019re no longer going to do share repo, but it sounds like that\u2019s not the case here. You would be able to do that if you so chose? Craig Arnold : Yes. I mean, our cash flow and liquidity remains quite strong. And as I said in my opening commentary, given the cash that we\u2019ll generate, the optionality around M&A and share repurchases is absolutely still on the table for us because and what we said as well is we don\u2019t we still don\u2019t see a need to let a bunch of cash build up on our balance sheet. We generate a lot of free cash flow in periods of economic weakness, and our cash flows are amazingly consistent in good times and in bad. And so that option is still on the table for us. John Walsh : Great. And then you touched a little bit on construction markets. Just wondering, high level, if you\u2019re kind of viewing the COVID-19 disruptions as an event. Or if to kind of exacerbate some slowing of the cycle. We\u2019ve had some companies use the word air pocket on new construction. Just anything you\u2019re seeing on that kind of commercial vertical of your business? Craig Arnold : Yes. I think for the most part, it\u2019s too early to really call. I mean, I think without a doubt, there\u2019ll be different segments of the market and our businesses that will be affected differently and perhaps in some cases, the shape of the recovery will look different depending upon which business we\u2019re in. But I think, quite frankly, as we kind of sort through it at this point, it is just too early to call and say to what extent are these businesses going to look different on the other side of the COVID-19 economic downturn than they looked before. I mean, there\u2019s a lot of debate and speculation around Aerospace. Certainly with oil prices being at the level that they\u2019re at today, there\u2019s been a lot of discussion around what happens with oil and gas markets on a go-forward basis. But we think the fundamentals around the global economy before this event were quite strong, and there\u2019s no reason to assume that once we get to the point where we have a therapeutic and a vaccine that the world doesn\u2019t return to trend growth. John Walsh : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Then our next question is going to come from the line of Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Please go ahead. John Welsh : Hey, morning. This is John Welsh for Julian. Maybe taking a closer look at Electrical Global. You mentioned that some of the declines this quarter were attributed to China and Asia specifically, sort of obviously. But can you talk a bit about maybe what you\u2019re seeing in the region in April and whether you\u2019re seeing some signs of kind of normalization or return to growth and maybe how you\u2019re using that as sort of a read to the Electrical Americas segment? Craig Arnold : Yes. I appreciate the question. And I think our experience in China specific, Julian, is very much like what you\u2019ve probably have heard from other companies where we did, in fact, see China come back in the month of March, not necessarily to the levels that it was at prior to the economic downturn, but we did see a clear recovery in China. Our factories in China are all open. We have full capacity today in terms of our available capacity. Some of the end markets continue to be weaker than they were before the economic downturn. But I can tell you that if we have a China like experience in the rest of the world, that would be extraordinarily positive and much more positive than we\u2019re assuming in our base case. We do believe that the way China approached this particular economic event was different. It was more unified. And so you found that companies in the economy were down and all came up kind of in a much more unified fashion. And that was fundamentally good for business and industry. Given the kind of disparate nature of the way that\u2019s taken place around the world and in other countries, we think the return to growth will be more gradual, more haphazard than probably what we\u2019re experiencing in China. And that\u2019s what we have on our base case. John Welsh : Got it. Thank you. And then maybe a follow-up on some of the restructuring plans. Is there sort of a focus here on Aerospace, just given that we could be in for a bit of a longer downturn and the first kind of significant downturn in some time for the end market? Is there a focus here on some of those off-the-shelf kind of restructuring programs to be targeted at Aerospace? Or is it more of a total company outlook? Craig Arnold : Yes. No, I think it would be fair to say, Julian, that we are focused in those businesses that will likely see the biggest economic downturn and perhaps those businesses that will face the biggest structural issues. And so you can assume that to the extent that industries are going through a pretty significant economic downturns, whether that\u2019s Aerospace or oil and gas markets, you can assume that we are focusing our activities around restructuring in those businesses, in addition to the things that we\u2019re doing more broadly across the company. John Welsh : Okay. Thank you. Yan Jin : Okay, good. Thank you all. We have reached the end of our call, and we do appreciate everybody dialing in and ask question. As always, Chip and I will be available to address your follow-up calls. Thank you all for joining us today. Have a good day. Bye. Operator : Thank you. That will conclude our conference for today.

Our agenda today including opening remarks by Craig highlighting the company\u2019s performance in the second quarter. As we have done in our past calls, we\u2019ll be taking questions at the end of Craig\u2019s comments. The press release and the presentation we\u2019ll go through today have been posted on our website at www.eaton.com. Please note that both the press release and the presentation include reconciliation to non-GAAP measures. A webcast of this call is accessible on our website, and it will be available for replay. I would like to remind you that our comments today will include statements related to expected future results of the company and are therefore forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our forecasted projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and the presentation. They\u2019re also outlined in our related 8-K filings. With that, I will turn it over to Craig. Craig Arnold : Okay. Thanks, Yan. We\u2019ll start on page three with recent highlights from the second quarter. And as you can imagine, I\u2019m extraordinarily pleased with the way our teams have executed in the midst of this pandemic and the economic downturn. We\u2019ve done a good job of keeping our employees safe, have delivered for our customers and certainly generated exceptional cash flow, all while flexing our costs at record rates. Our results, while also -- of last year, certainly in absolute terms, were better than expectations, and we continue to make an important investments for the future. Q2 earnings on a per share basis, $0.13 on a GAAP basis and $0.70 on an adjusted basis, which excludes $0.20 of charges related to acquisitions and divestitures and $0.37, related to the multiyear restructuring program that we just announced. Our Q2 revenues were $3.9 billion, down 22% organically. As we noted on our Q1 earnings call, April was down approximately 30%. This was followed by slightly better volumes in May and then relatively strong finish in June, which was down, let\u2019s call it, low double digits. And in fact, I mean, this has a point of maybe amplification, our Electrical business in the Americas, in Europe and Asia, all posted low single digit organic growth in revenue in the month of June. And so once again, our Electrical businesses are remaining very resilient in the face of this pandemic and economic downturn. Segment margins were 14.7%, down 110 basis points from Q1, and our [decremental] margins were at 25%, 5 points better than our guidance of 30%. Once again, a good indication of how well our teams have done in controlling the elements that are really within our control. However, recognizing that some of our businesses could be looking at a slow and certainly, what you could call it a prolong recovery, we announced a multiyear restructuring program of $280 million, including $187 million charge in Q2. These actions will reduce structural costs for sure and are targeted in those end markets, including commercial aerospace, oil and gas, NAFTA Class 8 truck and North America and European light vehicle markets, where these markets have been certainly highly impacted. I\u2019ll provide more details on this program in a few minutes, but they\u2019re covered on page 12. The other clear highlight for the quarter was our operating cash flow, which was $757 million and free cash flow of $667 million, both very strong results and which gives us the ability to really reaffirm our free cash flow guidance of $2.3 billion to $2.7 billion and a midpoint of $2.5 billion, so teams continue to do great in converting on cash as well. Finally, as most of you know, we made an important announcement during the quarter regarding sustainability and our commitment to 2030 sustainability goals. I thought it would be helpful just to put this announcement in the context in order to show you how it fits within the broader strategic framework of the company, which we do on page four. To simply stated at Eaton, sustainability really is at the core of our mission. We talk about our mission being to improve the quality of life and the environment. And certainly, that means sustainability. In fact, if you think about all of our value propositions with customers, they\u2019re built around creating safe, reliable and efficient solutions, let\u2019s call them sustainable solutions. And so as we oftentimes say, what\u2019s good for the environment is good for Eaton. We believe that meaningful efforts to support the environment are fundamental to how we create value for customers, and it\u2019s certainly a place where we think Eaton should play a leadership role. Sustainability, as we think about it, really presents growth opportunities to help our customers solve their business goals. And to this extent and have been so subjective, we\u2019ve laid out 10-year plans that include investing $3 billion in R&D to create sustainable products over this period of time. This also includes reducing our emissions from our installed base of products and upstream sources by some 15%. Just to maybe give you an example of where we think this really fits with our overall strategy. Sustainability really is about capitalizing for Eaton on secular growth trends around electrification, for sure, across all of our businesses and also in energy transition. Sustainability, I tell you, is also an important part of how we run the company on a day-to-day basis. Since 2015 we reduced our absolute greenhouse gas emissions by some 16%, and we\u2019re certainly on track to deliver our 2025 targets. By 2030, we now have committed to achieve science-based targets of 50% reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from 2018 levels. We\u2019re also committed to be carbon-neutral by 2030, a target that we\u2019ll achieve through a combination of initiatives, including carbon offsets, such as reforestation, continue to optimize our sourcing of renewable electricity in all of our operations as well as delivering energy storage solutions. And so pretty comprehensive set of plans that we have that we think will deliver this 2030 goal. And finally, to achieve these goals, we obviously have to continue to work on building a workforce that\u2019s engaged and passionate about making a difference, and so this will continue to be a large priority for the company overall. And so hopefully, that provides just a little context in terms of why we think sustainability is such an important initiative for Eaton and how we\u2019re going to convert on that and turn it into accelerated growth for the company. Now turning to page five, we summarize our Q2 financial results, and I\u2019d noticed a couple of things on this page. First, acquisitions increased sales by 2%. This was more than offset by the 8% impact from divestitures and also we had negative currency impact of negative 2%. I\u2019d also remind you that we now recognize all charges related to acquisitions, divestitures and restructuring at corporate rather than at the segment level. And we did this because we\u2019d hope it would make it easier for you to do your forecast by quarter by segment without the volatility that comes with these types of onetime charges. Next on page six, we show our results for Electrical Americas, revenues down 29%, 9% decline in organic revenue, a 19% impact from M&A, and this was primarily the divestiture of the lighting business and a small impact from negative currency as well of 1%. Operating margins increased 130 basis points to 20.7% and these margins were certainly favorably impacted by the divestiture of Lighting, but also our teams did a great job of controlling costs to really counter the impact of the economic impact of COVID-19. This combination resulted in a very strong decremental margin performance up 16%. So this segment continues to prove to be highly resilient when you look at margins, but also when you look at orders and backlog, orders increased 2.1% on a rolling 12-month basis, with strength in residential and utility and data centers. And of note here, our data center orders actually were up some 7% on a rolling 12-month basis. And lastly, our bookings remained strong. They were up 11% versus last year. Turning to page seven, we have our results for the Electrical Global segment. Revenues were down 16% with 14% decline in organic revenues and 2% headwind from currency. Operating margins here declined some 160 basis points, but to a very respectable 16% and decremental margins here were also very well managed, coming in at 26%. Orders declined 4.6% on a rolling 12-month basis with most of the significant declines coming, as you would expect, in global oil and gas markets and in industrial markets. So not an unexpected result with respect to where we saw strength and weakness. And lastly, our backlog for Electrical Global increased 2% on a year-over-year basis. On page eight, we summarize our Hydraulics segment. For Q2, revenues were down 32% with a 30% decline organically and a 2% currency impact. Operating margins were 9%, and orders for the quarter were down 33.7% year-over-year, and this was driven really by weakness in both OEMs and the distributor channel, both. We continue to work closely with Danfoss and completing the customary closing additions of regulatory approvals. And I would tell you that Danfoss organization remains excited about owning the business. We do, however, now expect the transaction to close at the end of Q1 next year. The delay, as you can imagine, due to the COVID-19 impact, which has impacted the pace of some of the regulatory approvals that we expect. On page nine, we summarize our results for the Aerospace segment. Revenues declined 27%, with a negative 35% in organic growth, offset by 8% increase from the acquisition of Soria. Operating margins declined to 14.8% and really, this is due to lower sales, but also the acquisition of Soria also had a dilutive impact on margins. Orders declined 12.8% on a rolling 12-month basis, with particular weakness in the quarter, as you would expect in commercial OEM and aftermarket, it is worth noting, I would tell you, though, that orders for the military aftermarket were up 13% on a rolling 12-month basis. Backlog was down 5% year-over-year overall. Certainly, as everyone here understands, the commercial aerospace markets are grappling with significant declines in passenger demand, and this is impacting our business and certainly impacting both the OEM and the aftermarket. Just maybe some context here, while we think about this as kind of a near term dislocation and we\u2019re taking certainly the needed steps to position this business for the future, we remain confident in the long-term attractiveness of aerospace market, and we\u2019ll certainly do what we need to do in order to manage our margins in the meantime. Next, on page 10, we summarize our results for the Vehicle segment. Revenues declined 59%, 52% of which was organic. In addition to the divestiture of the automotive fluid conveyance business, which impacted revenues by 4%, we had 3% negative impact on currency. The decrease in organic sales was really driven by, I\u2019d say, widespread customer plant shutdowns due to COVID-19, which really resulted in lower Class 8 OEM production as well as continued weakness in light vehicle production. Once again, it\u2019s a little bit more color on this one, during Q2, most light and commercial OEMs had shutdowns that ranged between 6 and 8 weeks. These shutdowns, which really began, let\u2019s say, in late March, occurred throughout the month of April and extended into mid-May. And so many of our customers were shut down for almost half the second quarter, but production is now certainly beginning to come back online. Global light vehicle market production was down 55% in Q2 and Class 8 OEM build was down from 70% in Q2. We now project NAFTA Class 8 production to be 175,000 units for the year, which is down slightly from our prior forecast of 189, 000 units, but still down some 49% from 2019. This steep reduction and certainly the sudden reduction in OEM production led to operating margins of a negative 6.4%. But I would add, this business has once again done a great job managing decrementals and despite this tremendous reduction in revenue, delivered a respectable decremental margin of 33%. Not surprisingly, and much needed, we do expect better market conditions in the second half, and our business will be well positioned to participate in this recovery. Moving to page 11, we have our eMobility segment. Revenues were down 33%, all of which was organic, organic margins of negative 3.6%, excuse me, operating margins of negative 3.6%, primarily due to lower volumes and particular weakness in the legacy internal combustion engine platforms. And once again, the ongoing increase in R&D expenditure. We continue to be enthused, by the way, about the long-term potential of the business. And quite frankly have seen nothing but upward revisions in the expectation for the penetration of electric vehicles. And so a market that we still think will be very attractive long term. We\u2019re very well positioned once again with the common technology platforms that we\u2019re creating, leveraging the strength in our core electrical business. A good example of this idea of everything becoming more electric is one of the recent wins that we\u2019ve had with the truck OEM, a $21 million program for export power inverter for a major commercial truck customer. And so in almost every aspect of our business, there\u2019s more electrical content, and we\u2019re well positioned once again through this particular segment to participate in that growth. Overall, we\u2019ve won programs with a value of approximately $500 million of mature year revenue. On page 12, we show the details of our plans to accelerate and, I\u2019d say, expand our restructuring actions and I say accelerate because for the most part, we\u2019re pulling forward a number of the restructuring ideas that we would have done anyway. Given the economic implications of the pandemic, we naturally have a greater sense of urgency and also more capacity to take on these projects. We announced the $280 million multiyear restructuring program, as we noted, designed to eliminate structural costs, and we\u2019ve taken charges of $187 million in Q2, and we expect to see additional cost of $93 million realized through 2022. Just to characterize those additional dollars, we\u2019d expect deliver over the next three years, some $33 million of charges in the second half of this year, $55 million in 2021 and $5 million in 2022. We would expect to realize $200 million of material benefits from these actions once they\u2019re fully implemented, and we think full year implementation is 2023. Approximately two thirds of these costs are in our industrial businesses, principally vehicle and aerospace and the remaining one third is within our electrical sector, particularly with an emphasis on our oil and gas business that we\u2019ll report through our electrical global segment. Naturally, we\u2019re focused on those businesses serving end markets that are more severely impacted by the pandemic. And then turning to page 13, we do our best to provide a Q3 outlook on revenues versus last year. And while you can imagine that all these markets will be stronger than what we realized in Q2, this is really a year-over-year look for Q3 versus last year. For Electrical Americas, we expect organic revenue to be between down 2% and up 2%, so essentially flat with strength in residential utility data centers, offsetting weakness in industrial markets. For Electrical Global, our current view is organic revenues will decline between 10% and 14%, with strength in Asia Pacific and data center markets, offset by declines in Europe and once again in the oil and gas market. For aerospace, we expect organic revenues will be down between 28% and 32%, with continued strength in military, offset by really significant declines in all of the commercial markets. And for vehicle, we project revenues will decline between 30% and 34%. So markets are still very weak in absolute terms, but these markets will be up significantly from Q2. And for eMobility, we expect declines of between 13% and 17%, once again, pressured from legacy internal combustion engine platforms. And lastly, for Hydraulics, we think markets will be down between 23% and 27%. For Eaton overall, we\u2019re estimating Q3 revenues to be down between 13% and 17%, and so an improvement versus Q2, which was down some 22%. But still in absolute terms, markets are still in decline. Moving to page 14, here we provide our best look at guidance for Q3 and some commentary on the full year. But for Q3, we expect organic revenues to decline between 13% to 17%. And this really does include what we know about July, where we saw low double digit declines. We\u2019ve elected not to provide full year revenue guidance given the kind of the ongoing uncertainty around the pandemic and its impact on markets in Q4 as many of you aware, we are still dealing with the pandemic and in various regions [ph] of the US and around the world we are still seeing a growth in the number of cases and so we are still l living in this period of uncertainty. We do think Q2 will be the trough for organic revenue declines, and barring a second wave of the pandemic, Q4 should be better than Q3. For Q3 and full year, we expect decremental margins of between 25% and 30%. And for Q3, we expect our tax rate on adjusted earnings to be between 15% and 16%. We're maintaining our free - 2020 free cash flow guidance, the range of $2.3 billion to $2.7 billion. And I would note that this range does, in fact, include now the impact related to the multi-year restructuring program that we announced, and that was not in our prior guidance. As a point of reference, in the first half, just to give you some comfort around our ability to deliver this number, we generated some 35% of our $2.5 billion midpoint that's in our free cash flow guidance, and this number is very consistent with our performance over the last 5 years, and so we do tend to be a bit back half-loaded. We\u2019re providing new guidance for share buybacks, and we\u2019re saying between $1.7 billion and $1.9 billion for the year. And recall that we repurchasing - 3 billion of shares in Q1 with the proceeds of the lighting sale. We continue to deliver strong free cash flow, and we now plan to buy back between $400 million and $600 million of shares in half of the year. And finally, and maybe just like we are doing here inside our company, just to bring it back to kind of the broader longer term strategy and where we're headed as an organization. And we will continue to effectively manage through the short term challenges associated with the pandemic, but we also remain focused on the broader strategic and financial goals that we've laid out in our meeting in New York, and we\u2019ve summarized once again here on page 15. Number one, ensuring that we continue to move the company in the direction of becoming what we say as an intelligent power management company that takes advantage of important secular growth trends, and we talked about them being electrification, energy transition, IoT and connectivity and blended power. So these trends are continuing and despite whatever temporary hiccups we\u2019re experiencing, we think long-term is the right place to be. By doing so, we\u2019re working on creating a company that's going to deliver better secular growth. And better growth through various cycles, higher margins and with much better earnings consistency. Our long-term goals have not changed. It includes 2% to 3% organic growth, 20% segment margins, 8% to 9% EPS growth and $3 billion a year of free cash flow. And with our strong cash flow, we\u2019ll continue to be focused and disciplined in how we deploy it by investing in organic growth as atop priority, delivering top quartile dividends, an ongoing program of share buyback then actively managing our portfolio while being a disciplined acquirer. So we continue to remain excited by the Eaton story. I hope you are as well. And with that, I'll turn it back to Yan. Yan Jin : Okay. Good. Thanks, Craig. Before we start our Q&A of our call today, I do see that we have a number of individuals in the queue with questions. So, I appreciate if you can limit your opportunity just one question and a follow-up. Thanks again in advance for your cooperation. With that, I will turn it over to the operator, who will give you guys the instruction. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Nicole DeBlase from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Nicole DeBlase : Yes. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Craig Arnold : Hi. Nicole DeBlase : Hey, there. So I guess maybe starting with the restructuring actions that you guys are taking, Craig. So the information on the costs were helpful. I guess maybe some color qualitatively around what you\u2019re actually focusing on, headcount versus maybe footprint or other things. And I guess where I\u2019m going with this is cadence of payback over the next few years, including the second half of '20 as well as, I guess, why it\u2019s taking sometime to actually get the payback from those actions? Craig Arnold : Yes. I appreciate the question, Nicole. And as I mentioned in my opening commentary and one of the things we\u2019ve talked about historically is that we always, as a company, have kind of a future view of restructuring projects that we\u2019d like to take on. And the pacing items generally tend to be our own internal capacity to deal them with them and manage them effectively, as well as our customers' ability to absorb them without creating disruptions for them. And certainly, in the event of an economic downturn like this one, it gives everybody more capacity to take on these projects. And so a lot of what we\u2019re doing today, I\u2019d say, when you talk about footprint versus headcount. I think the important way to answer that question is that it\u2019s all structural. And so these are all cost items that were taken on that will not come back in the event that - or when revenues return. And so these are things that are really focusing on taking structural fixed costs out of our system, some of which will be headcount, some of which will be around footprint. We have not yet made these announcements completely internally in terms of where those impacts are going to be. And so we\u2019ll wait and provide that detail a little later on. But it will be completely structural. To your point around timing, I think some of these items, obviously, will impact and have a benefit earlier than others. But it\u2019s one of the things I would say, as you think about the decremental margins that we\u2019re delivering as a company and what\u2019s embedded in our guidance, it\u2019s one of the reasons why we can deliver these very strong decrementals is because we are flexing our businesses and flexing our costs. And so I\u2019d say, as we think about this payback, a $280 million investment with essentially a $200 million return. This is a very attractive program in terms of the return on the investment. And we\u2019ll get some of the benefits sooner, some will come later, but in aggregate, it\u2019s extraordinarily strong returns on these dollars that we\u2019re investing. Nicole DeBlase : Got it. Thanks, Craig. That\u2019s helpful. And you kind of teed up my follow-up there, I guess. And I wanted to hit on decrementals. The 25% was obviously impressive this quarter and above your own 30% guidance. I guess, how do we think about that through the rest of the year? I mean, to me, we kind of know that 2Q, at least we hope, will be the low point with respect to revenue. So I guess is there any possibility that 25% could actually become something better in the second half as you guys execute on cost savings and perhaps you get a little bit of sequential improvement in revenues as well? Craig Arnold : Yes. I appreciate the question. And our teams just have done an extraordinary job year-to-date on decremental margins and as we flex costs. And embedded in that guidance of $25 million to $30 million is, once again, the uncertainty around whether or not we end up experiencing a second wave of the pandemic. And as you know as well as anyone, we\u2019re seeing these hotspots around the US and potential threats of going into some form of, if not full shutdowns, retrenchments in many of our markets. And so there\u2019s still a lot of uncertainty, and it\u2019s one of the reasons why we still have this fairly wide range of decrementals, as you can imagine as well. We took a lot of extraordinary one-time costs in Q2 around time off without pay, and travel was essentially come to a grounding halt. And so some of these costs will certainly come back as the year unfolds, but if we don\u2019t end up with a second wave, in the second half of the year, we will likely do better than kind of the mid-point of this range of decrementals that we\u2019ve laid out. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Joe Ritchie [Goldman Sachs]. Please go ahead. Joe Ritchie : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Craig Arnold : Hi. Joe Ritchie : Craig, maybe just starting out, why don\u2019t we \u2013 I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts on, just non-res construction, specifically in your exposure to it. There\u2019s a lot of concern as we kind of head into 2021, that the markets are going to downturn. And so, I\u2019d be curious to just hear, how your business is positioned for potential non-res downturn? And how maybe some of these actions that you're taking are potentially like offsetting measures for that? Craig Arnold : Yes. Thanks, I appreciate the question. And when you use the term non-res construction, really, that's - for us, that's really most of our electrical business, right, because that's everything other than residential and residential today, would account for less than 20% of our total business. And so it's a really big category. The way we tend to think about it is, that maybe just take you through some of the key important segments for us. We think as has been the case for some time. We think data centers continue to be a very strong market and are performing well in the near term. And we think long-term, continues to be strong. We think the utility market continues to be a very attractive market. And will perform well over the long-term, and has held up extremely well. Residential, by the way, and I know you asked the non-res question, but residential has just been extraordinarily strong with essentially high double-digit kind of growth numbers, in Q2 overall. So resi continues to be extraordinarily strong. And then, I mean, I think the kind of spear of your question really gets to this whole question, what's going to happen within commercial markets. And there's been a lot of talk and speculation around the death of the office, and whether or not anybody is ever going to go back to the office again. I don't think that's the case, by the way. In fact, I can point to examples, where companies have actually had to take down more office space, because you have the social distance now on offices, and so you need more space to house the same number of individuals. But certainly, there's certainly some risk to what we call the office piece of non-res, certainly, if you think about retail, those markets will probably is weak. But offsetting that, there will be other markets that are strong. We think that, you think about warehousing as a segment, we think, will be strong. We think water, wastewater market will be strong. And so I think, the fact that our electrical business has held up so well or better than others would imagine is the fact that we do play across, so many of these different end-markets, some of which are experiencing, some of these negative forces, others of which are seeing positive impact. And as a result, this business is extraordinarily resilient. And so we remain very optimistic about the prospects of our electrical business. There will be dislocations, in perhaps certain markets or certain regions of the world. But by and large, we think the market will be just fine and using kind of China as a good proxy for the rest of the world, as they get each to come through the pandemic. China is, already back to positive growth both in sales and orders. And so we're hopeful once we get through this and we get a vaccine, we get an effective therapeutic that the markets are likely going to return the trend level of growth. Joe Ritchie : That's helpful color, Craig. And maybe my one quick follow-up is more on just free cash flow. It was nice to see you guys affirmed the range for this year. I guess, as you're thinking about next year, also in the context of some of the cost actions that you're taking. I know it's too difficult at this point to say exactly what the number will be next year. But if growth starts to return to something that's a little bit more normal, what are your thoughts on your ability to grow free cash flow in 2021? Craig Arnold : The way we generally think about it is that certainly, in periods like this as we de-capitalize the business and we're freeing up a lot of cash from working capital. But also, as you saw, the earnings are down dramatically. And so, as we continue to - as we expand through an expansionary cycle, the earnings will be up significantly. And then with that, your cash flows will be up. And so if you think about Eaton over time, and through various cycles, our cash flows have been just amazingly consistent, in terms of generating very strong free cash flow, really, at all points of expansion and contraction. Rick, did you want to add something? Richard Fearon : I\u2019m just going to add a little color on the trends in electrical. We measure it in a lot of different ways. But one of the ways we measure it is looking at our negotiations for large projects in the Americas. We have very good data, and it's a very big business for us. And if you take out the activities related oil and gas, our negations in the second quarter were flat with the year ago. And so it gives you some indication that the balance, that Craig talked about on all these different segments, they come together in a way that creates a lot of stability. And that gives us a fair amount of confidence that even with the turbulence and the macro economy, there are enough sources of strength that those sources offset the weak spot. Joe Ritchie : Okay. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research. Please go ahead. Jeff Sprague : Thank you. Good day, everyone. I just would like to get a little additional color on vehicle, obviously, a very, very tough quarter, production on the automotive side starts to look better as the lockdowns ease. Just give us a little sense of what you're thinking for the profit trajectory there? Should this be the only quarter where we see an operating loss? And maybe give us a little color on how much, if any, of these restructuring benefits might flow through to those businesses in the back half? Craig Arnold : Yes. I appreciate the question, Jeff, and it's been kind of a long time since we've ever, since we lost money in our vehicle business. And I'd just say, once again, just an extraordinary combination of events when you look at some of these numbers around production, both in Class 8 and in global light vehicle, essentially, half the quarter was lost. And so, the team once again did, I think, an extraordinary job in maintaining a 33% decremental in that environment. We certainly - to look forward, volumes are going to be significantly better than in Q2. And we would fully expect that the margins for the business this year will be double-digit, and we would not expect to see a loss in the vehicle business in any subsequent quarter, barring another return to this horrific market kind of event that we experienced over the last quarter. The details around where the benefits are going to flow, once again, we've not made internal announcements specifically to some of these initiatives. And so we'll give you more color later on. It's certainly fully embedded in the decremental margin assumptions that we've laid out for the year, but you certainly can expect our vehicle business to return to attractive levels of profitability post Q2. Jeff Sprague : Great. And second question, just on aero. Do you think we've seen the bottom in aftermarket activity? Or do we still got to deal with the delayed impact of parked airplanes and used material and stuff working its way through the system and maybe we're a quarter or two out on the bottom there? Craig Arnold : Yes. I mean, it's a good question and one that everybody trying to get their arms around, specifically in terms of what's the outlook for aerospace, specifically, what's the outlook for aftermarket in terms of our consumers are going to be comfortable getting back on planes flying again, which is as you know, is what drives the aftermarket. I'd say we had pretty horrific numbers in terms of aftermarket in Q2, down fairly dramatically. So it's tough to imagine that things could get much worse than what we experienced in Q2. Activity levels in general, as you're well aware, are improving. There is more planes flying today. There's more hours of flights today than there have been certainly over Q2. Many parts of the world, in many regions of the world, their numbers are better than ours in the U.S. If you think about Asia, you think about Europe, they've done a better job of getting handle on the pandemic. And so you're seeing the data there improve perhaps at a faster rate than the U.S. data. So I think it's quite - it's unclear today. And a lot of planes on the ground, and you talk about the idea of parting out airplanes and how that's going to impact the aftermarket. I just think it's too early to tell whether that's going to have a prolonged impact or not. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Nigel Coe : Thanks. Good morning. Good morning, Craig. Good morning, Rick. Just wanted to really dig into your, sort of, your 3Q framework and the down low double digits first\u2026 Craig Arnold : I'm sorry, Nigel, you're coming through very faint. We can barely hear you. So maybe you can just speak up a little bit. Nigel Coe : Maybe I'll use my handset. Is that better? Craig Arnold : Perfect. Nigel Coe : Yes. I've got a very dodgy headset. I need to invest. My home office still needs a lot to be desired. So the July down low double digits versus the down 13 to 17 framework. And I understand you want to be conservative. But is there any reason why July would be better than the 3Q framework? And then just within that, Electrical Americas looking to be flat versus the down 9% in 2Q. Again, just what's flipping between 2Q and 3Q? And any end markets to call out there would be helpful. Craig Arnold : Yes. I appreciate the question, Nigel. And I think what we\u2019re really trying to deal with here is how precise we can actually be in setting any of these forecasts. And I would tell you that if you think about June and July, kind of, essentially running at about the same levels and as we think about our Q3 forecast, we really think about it mostly as a continuation of what we experienced over the last couple of months. And so I think on the margin, whether it's one or two points better or worse. It's really difficult to judge. But one of the things that has us a little bit nervous as we'll freely admit, is the fact that you are continuing to see the spread of COVID-19 in so many parts of the U.S. And so if there's a concern that we have that could potentially take the next couple of months down slightly below what we've experienced over the last two months, it's whether or not the U.S. specifically, and then you have obviously, regions like India and Brazil, whether or not we get a handle on the spread of the pandemic. So that's the piece that has us all just a little bit nervous and perhaps a little bit conservative around what does the real outlook look like for the balance of Q3. Nigel Coe : Yes. And then Electrical Americas, what's slipping \u2013 what's getting materially better between 2Q and 3Q? Craig Arnold : Yes. In Electrical Americas, I'd say that for the most part, they experienced kind of the same kind of shock to the system that the other kind of parts of our businesses experience, where you've had a lot of construction projects essentially to shutdown in Q2. As you're well aware, there were certain regions of the U.S. where construction was deemed essential. There was other places where constructing projects were simply delayed. And so I think the catch-up effect that we're seeing a little bit in the Americas, specifically, is the fact that we would anticipate that you don't see the kind of wholesale shutdowns of the U.S. economy that we experienced in part of Q2. And so on an incremental basis, quarter-over-quarter basis, we would expect the Electrical Americas business to perform better. Richard Fearon : Also, Nigel, it's Rick. We had some production challenges during Q2. We had to relay out plants, and we had some plants where the plants had to be closed for certain periods due to COVID issues. And so that constrained our sales. And we've sorted through all that. And that, particularly in places like residential, will allow higher sales volumes in Q3. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from David Raso from Evercore. Please go ahead. David Raso : Hi. Good morning. Can you clarify your comment, if I heard you correctly, the month of June, did you say Electrical Americas posted low single-digit revenue growth? Same thing for Electrical Global? I'm just trying to \u2013 if that is correct, why then does it step down the flat for Americas in the third quarter if you\u2019re already up low single and then global goes from up single digit to actually the next quarter down 12% at the midpoint. I'm just trying to understand, what you're really seeing in July in the electrical business? Craig Arnold : Yes. What I was really trying to convey in that comment. First of all, you heard me correctly, electrical, essentially around the world actually did pose positive sales growth in the month of June. But it's oftentimes difficult to read too much into a given month because there's also some catch up, right? We talked about the fact that we had, as Rick noted, we had factories that were shut down, we had projects that were delayed. And so we think it was certainly a little bit of catch-up that took place in the month of June. One of the reasons why we experienced kind of growth across the region and projects that perhaps should have been delivered in April or May, that slipped into the month of June and so as the economy in the U.S. specifically, continue to open. And so we do think there was some catch-up in the month of June. And so on the margins, things are slightly worse or about the same as the June rate in subsequent months. It's really because of this catch-up effect that we think we experienced in the month of June. David Raso : But is that what you're seeing in July? I mean, especially global, are we going from up low single, say, there was some catch-up, then to put down 12 in the third quarter. Have you seen that much giveback already in July? Is it global already down that much in July? Craig Arnold : Yes, I'd say that once again, in terms of the - you say global specifically, what we're experiencing overall as a company in terms of the guidance numbers that we provided, that's consistent with what the company has experienced. I don't think we provided specific guidance for Electrical Global overall, but - so I'd say that it's certainly consistent with our overall guidance for the quarter for Eaton overall. David Raso : I appreciate that. Yes. I was just saying international, you call it global, but the international business being down 12% organically in the third quarter, coming off of a June that was up low single. It's just enough of a delta. I just don't see if you saw a big drop-off in July already to suggest that for the Electrical International business. Richard Fearon : What we are seeing, David, is we are seeing pronounced weakness in oil and gas. I mean it is not coming back. And so that's what's driving that - the weakness in Electrical Global. Our global oil and gas business is all reported in Electrical Global. So that's really the factor that is causing the markets to be as weak as we estimate. If you were to take that out, Electrical Global would look much like Electrical Americas. David Raso : Sure. But in the month of June, oil was down big, I assume, and you still put up low single-digit growth in electrical international. So anyway, I'm just trying to understand it. And then lastly, go ahead... Richard Fearon : I was just going to say there is a lot to this pent-up demand and people, we, being able to deliver on customers wanting us to deliver projects that had gotten delayed, and so that June is distorted by that a bit. David Raso : That's fair. And just lastly clarification to an earlier question, did you say vehicle margins for the year would be back to double digit? Richard Fearon : Yes, I did. David Raso : Okay, that\u2019s impressive. Okay, thank you very much. I appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Jeff Hammond from KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Jeff Hammond : Hey, guys. Good morning. I just want to dig in on some of these markets that are proving more resilient in Americas. Can you just talk about where kind of the incremental utility spend is seen or where you're seeing the most resilience? And on the data center side, I know we were planning for kind of an air pocket, and that seems to be coming back. Is that coming back stronger or in line with expectations? Craig Arnold : Yes. I'd say in the utility market, Jeff, I think it's pretty broad-based is what we're seeing really in utility markets. Those markets are holding up fairly well. And I would say that within the U.S., I can't really - I don't know that there's a very different story depending upon what region of the U.S. You're looking at. But where we play in the utility space, on the distribution side, as obviously, resilience and investing in grid resilience continues to be an important need in so many of our communities around the U.S., it continues to be fairly stable and predictable market. In data center, specifically, what we're really seeing is a return in hyperscale. And as we've talked about on prior calls, hyperscale does tend to be lumpy. You get large orders, and then they'll go quiet for a while and you get large orders again. So if you think about data centers overall, we saw very strong growth in hyperscale. In the quarter that really is a return to growth as they continue to kind of build out their requirements. Jeff Hammond : Okay. And then just on the hydraulics side, is that just a function of timing around approvals? Or is there anything else going on? Craig Arnold : I think it's a general slowdown in the market that you're experiencing in hydraulics and specifically in construction, the Ag market is holding up a bit better. Certainly the China market is holding up very well in the context of the pandemic and really have already returned to growth. And so it's really just the general slowdown in the construction market that's having a big impact on hydraulics. Richard Fearon : And Jeff, if you were also asking about the timing of closing the sale, it's really a function of many of the regulators are still working from home. And so that's greatly slowed their ability to process all of the filings. I mean, in any large transaction like our sale of hydraulics, we're talking about thousands and thousands of pages of material and without their staffs at hand, without the ability to easily copy things and have team meetings, it just is taking longer and really seeing that for all acquisitions, not just ours. So we're not surprised by it. Things are progressing in a normal way. We're receiving the kinds of questions that we would expect to receive is just taking a bit longer to get those questions. Craig Arnold : And I mentioned in my opening commentary that how enthusiastic Danfoss remains around the transaction itself. And if anybody wants to get a sense of their real enthusiasm, the Founder of the company and the CEO posted a video this week on LinkedIn, where they're making the announcements to their organization about to bring together of these two businesses and professing their enthusiasm to get this transaction closed. And so we remain absolutely convinced that while it's been a quarter delay, the transaction will close, and they love the transaction, and it's going to create real value for them. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from John Inch from Gordon Haskett. Please go ahead. John Inch : Thanks. Good morning everyone. Craig and Rick, just to put a finer point on this non-resi issue. We get these questions all the time. Could you just remind us how big the new build portion for office buildings is as a percent of, say, electrical Americas and global because that would be - seem to be the one area that debatably, right, could be at risk or is not necessarily going to expand. I can't imagine it's that big, but maybe you could just frame it out for us in terms of its magnitude. Craig Arnold : Yes, I don't have the new - I don't have that split. I mean, maybe 1 data point, John, that may be helpful for you to kind of quantify or gauge the impact. Today, if you think about the office piece of kind of our electrical business. What goes into office build, it's just under 20% of the total electrical business. And so to your point, within that, some of it's new build, some of it's retrofit and modifications. And so hopefully, those - that data point, we can try to get to the data around what's new versus remodel and refurb but it's under 20% of the total business. And I do say, I think it is debatable in terms of where this is going to ultimately take us in terms of whether or not working from home has been wonderful to date and companies have managed it longer term. I think it's still an open question mark around efficiency and organizational effectiveness in working from home. And as people come back to offices and this need to social distance is going to require more space. And so I think it will be an interesting one to watch in terms of how it unfolds. John Inch : Yes. No, I don't disagree with that. And I think historically, you've said retrofit sort of 40% to 50% of the whole electrical business. So maybe we can extrapolate that. I'm not sure. Richard Fearon : It's more like 25% to 30% for the whole electrical sector. John Inch : Okay. All right. So I had that number wrong, but that's - it's still windows it down. Just as another clarification. Is the $280 million charge on top of the $50 million to $60 million of quiet restructuring you guys do every year? Or are you going to be lumping in that $50 million to $60 million with the $280 million? So kind of the whole thing gets called out over the next couple of years of the charge enactment? Craig Arnold : Yes. It's really the latter, John. And that was my point that I was making in my opening commentary around we had a number of restructuring programs that we were intended to do anyway and pulling those forward and accelerating them. And so it's really the latter. So, we intend to take this one charge related to the $280 million laid out the way we articulated that would then eliminate the other restructuring programs that we would have otherwise planned to do over the next three years. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Andy Casey from Wells Fargo Security. Please go ahead. Andy Casey : Hi. Good morning. Can you talk about M&A potential? I'm just wondering if the dislocation has created any incremental opportunities? And then can you comment on any valuations you might be seeing? Craig Arnold : Yes. Appreciate the question, Andy. And certainly, we remain, obviously, in a position where we have the balance sheet that gives us that optionality around keeping M&A on the table and as we talked about our cash flow generation this year as well as certainly, the M&A event that will take place with the sale of hydraulics, and we'd expect to bring in another $2.85 billion of cash with that transaction when it closes. So the balance sheet is in great shape, and we have plenty of firepower. Having said that, I would tell you, though, that given the level of uncertainty around market outlook as well as the fact that valuations and companies coming to terms with the fact that perhaps some of their businesses aren't worth today what they were worth maybe three or four months ago. That does take some time for that new reality to set in. And so I would say today that valuations have not and expectations have not necessarily come down commensurate with the change in market outlook. And so those two things together says we will continue to actively work the pipeline. We are, in fact, having a number of conversations, our focus and priorities continue to be largely around the Electrical business. We think, in this environment, we'll have to see whether or not aerospace clears up the future of Aerospace and outlook clears up enough that for us to get back on kind of front foot in and around an Aerospace transaction. But right now, I'd say that we're working the pipeline. It's an active pipeline. But valuations have really not yet come in. Andy Casey : Okay. Thanks, Craig. And then a real quick one, I guess, for Rick. You gave the Q3 framework. If you isolate out the kind of nonrecurring stuff like occurred in Q2 beneath the segment operating profit line, do you expect any sizable change in things like corporate pension and other? Richard Fearon : Not any significant change. It should be relatively consistent. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Andrew Obin from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Andrew Obin : Hi, guys. I guess still good morning. Just a question on inventories in the channel. Can you just tell, have dealers been destocking during this? Where is the level both in North America and internationally as far as you can see? Is there a need for it for restocking basically? Craig Arnold : Yes. I think the question around whether or not there's a need for restocking is still yet to be determined, Andrew. I can tell you that we did experience some destocking during the course of Q2. And that destocking is certainly behind us now. And today, when we do our channel checks and talk to our distributor partners, they'll tell you that they feel like the inventory levels today are well aligned with their outlook for revenue. And so I think it's too early maybe to make a call on inventory restocking, but certainly, the destocking of inventory has stopped and is behind us now. Andrew Obin : And just in terms of supply chain, I've \u2013 between China, between sort of Mexico shutting down, have you guys made any changes to your internal sourcing, internal supply chains post COVID? Thank you. Craig Arnold : Yes. I'd say nothing material. One of the things that we've always done and believed in strongly is manufacturing in what we call [zone] currency, which means essentially we what we sell in a region, we generally make in a region. We do, in fact, ship some parts around and components around the world. I would tell you that throughout this whole entire pandemic, our supply chain has held up extraordinarily well. And I can say with confidence that we didn't lose a single order because our supply chain broke down. And somehow, we ended up with an inability to deliver. The bigger challenge that we experienced as a company really is what largely took place along the border. As companies and countries, excuse me, have had different criteria around what industries are deemed essential. And so there was a period of time when we had some challenges with the Mexican definition versus the U.S. definition. I can tell you that today, that's behind us as well. But for the most part, supply chain has not been a big challenge for us during this current pandemic. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Please go ahead. Julian Mitchell : Hi, good morning. Maybe just trying to understand the free cash flow a little bit better. Within that $2.5 billion midpoint for this year, maybe help me understand what's the hydraulics contribution within that? And also, what's the cash portion of the restructuring charges in that number, please? Richard Fearon : Yes. I don't have at hand the exact hydraulics portion. We'll address that offline. The cash part of the restructuring charge is probably on the order of $50 million. And so that's why we believe that our guidance, even inclusive of that cash portion of restructuring still holds true. Julian Mitchell : Understood. Thank you. And then maybe just a second one around the Aerospace, maybe margin dynamics. Help us understand what the impact of Souriau-Sunbank was and that integration within the, I think, almost 1,000 basis points drop in the Aero margin in Q2. And maybe how you see that impact from the acquisition playing out over the balance of the year? And I don't know if you quantified, but maybe help us see what the commercial aftermarket revenue drop was in Q2, please? Craig Arnold : Yes. Souriau-Sunbank and its impact on margins, I have to do some quick math. But I think you have it all with that frame. Let me just see what I have here. Richard Fearon : Yes. I mean, the margins of Souriau pre-acquisition were in the high teens. And that, obviously, compared to our business that was in the 22% to 24% range. And so I think the easiest way, Julian, is just to use those numbers. And we also gave you the overall sales volume of Souriau, which is about $300 million a year. And so that should allow you to back into the impact from Souriau itself. Craig Arnold : 100 bps or something like that? Richard Fearon : I think probably 150 bps. Yan Jin : Okay. Good. Thank you all. I think we have reached to the end of our call, and we do appreciate everybody\u2019s questions. As always, Chip and I will be available to address your follow-up questions. Thank you for joining us today, and have a good day. Operator : Thank you. And that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T conferencing services.

Unidentified Company Representative : Yes. Operator : Mr. Jin, can you hear me? Please go ahead. Yan Jin : Okay. Now I can hear you. Okay. Good morning, everyone. I'm Yan Jin, Eaton's Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you all for joining us for Eaton's Third Quarter 2020 Earning Call. With me today are Craig Arnold, our Chairman and CEO; and Rick Fearon, Vice Chairman and the Chief Financial and Planning Officer.  Our agenda today includes opening remarks by Craig highlighting the company's performance in the third quarter. As we have done on our past calls, we'll be taking questions at the end of Craig's comments. The press release and the presentation we'll go through today have been posted on our website at www.eaton.com. Please note that both the press release and the presentation, including reconciliations to non-GAAP measures, and webcast of this call is accessible on our website and will be available for replay.  I would like to remind you that our comments today will including statements related to the expected future results of the company and are, therefore, forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our forecasted projection due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described into our earning release and our presentation. They're also outlined in our related 8-K filing. With that, I will turn it over to Craig. Craig Arnold : Okay. Thanks, Yan. Yes, let's start on Page 3 with a highlight of our Q3 results. And I'd say -- begin by saying I'm really pleased with how the entire Eaton team has continued to deliver and perform during this ongoing pandemic and economic downturn. And our results, while certainly below last year in absolute terms, they were much better than our guidance for the quarter : Q3 earnings per share at $1.11 on a GAAP basis and $1.18 on an adjusted basis, which naturally excludes the $0.05 of charges related to acquisitions and divestitures and $0.02 related to a multiyear restructuring program.  Our Q3 revenues of $4.5 billion, down 9% organically compared with last year but up 16% versus Q2. Segment margins were 17.6%. These margins were 290 basis points above Q2 levels. And our decremental margins of 25% were at the low end of our guidance range. And our organization, I just must say again, is doing an outstanding job of managing discretionary costs.  We also generated strong cash flow in the quarter. Operating cash flow was $921 million, and our free cash flow was $832 million. As a result, we are reaffirming our 2020 guidance for cash flow with a midpoint of $2.5 billion of free cash flow and narrowing the range to $2.4 billion to $2.6 billion. And lastly, we repurchased $177 million of shares in the quarter, and we're at $1.5 billion on a year-to-date basis. Turning to Page 4. We summarize our Q3 results, and I'll just highlight a few items here. First, acquisitions increased sales by 2%, but this was more than offset by the 8% impact of our divestitures. And this was primarily, as you'll recall, the Lighting business. Second, our segment margins at 17.6% were down versus last year but still at very healthy levels, especially given the reduction in revenue. And lastly, I would just remind the group that we now record all charges related to acquisitions and divestitures and restructuring costs at corporate rather than at the segment level. And we hope it just makes it easier for you to model our results on a going-forward basis.  Next, on Page 5, we show our results for the Electrical Americas segment. And we're very pleased that our largest operating segment returned to positive organic growth of 3% during the quarter. So it's better than the high end of our guidance range, which was up 2%, and this was really driven by particular strength in residential and utility markets. Revenues were naturally impacted by the sale of the Lighting business, which reduced sales by 19%. And negative currency impacted sales by 1%. Operating margins increased 280 basis points to 22.2%. And so our margins continue to be favorably impacted by the divesture of Lighting as well as by ongoing cost containment actions. Our Americas business continued to show resiliency also when you look at our orders and backlog. Orders were down 1% on a rolling 12-month basis, excluding Lighting. And we saw, once again, particular strength in residential and also in data center markets.  Similar to what you've seen from others, secular growth is being driven by really this increased focus on the home, in this work-for-home environment and all of our growing dependence on digital connectivity. On a rolling 12-month basis, residential orders were up 14% and data center orders were up mid-single digit. And sequentially, Q3 orders were up 16% from Q2. Lastly, our backlog was up 11% from last year driven by, once again, this noted strength in residential and data centers but also by utility markets as utility markets are benefiting from the increased investment in Smart Grid and this energy transition that's taking place.  On Page 6, we have a summary of our Electrical Global segment. Revenues were down 8% with 10% decline in organic revenues, partially offset by 2% tailwind from currency. Lower organic sales were driven principally by weakness in oil and gas and industrial markets. If you excluded oil and gas and industrial businesses, our European business was slightly negative and our Asia business was slightly positive. Operating margins declined 280 basis points to 16.6% but were up 60 basis points on a sequential basis. Orders declined 6% on a rolling 12-month basis with declines driven once again by oil and gas and industrial markets, partially offset by strength in residential, data centers and utility markets. It's also worth noting here that data center orders were very strong in this segment, increasing some 40% on a rolling 12-month basis. We also had solid sequential growth in orders, up 12% from Q2. And lastly, we continue to grow our backlog, which increased 7% versus last year. Moving to Page 7. we have the results of our Hydraulics segment. Revenues were down 15%, which was all organic, but this was much better than the 25% organic decline at the midpoint of our Q3 guidance as end markets recovered faster than anticipated. Operating margins were 9.8%, flat with the last year. And encouragingly here, I'd say we saw momentum in our Q3 orders, which increased 8%, with strength in both agricultural and construction equipment markets. And lastly, we remain on track to close the Danfoss sale by the end of Q1 next year.  Next on Page 8, we have the financial company of our Aerospace segment. Revenues declined 13%, down 26% organically, partially offset by a 12% increase from the acquisition of Souriau and a 1% positive currency impact. And as you would expect, organic revenue declines here were driven primarily by the continued downturn in commercial aviation, which was partially offset by growth in military. On a sequential basis, organic revenues were up 15% from Q2 levels. And while at healthy levels, operating margins declined to 18.5% due to lower sales volume. And margins were certainly impacted by the impact of the Souriau acquisition. I would note here that margins were up 370 basis points from Q2 and that the business is really doing an outstanding job of rightsizing and reducing discretionary costs. Orders were down 22% on a rolling 12-month basis, and the backlog was down 11%.  Turning to Page 9, we summarize our results for our Vehicle segment. Revenues were down 25%, including 20% organic decline. The divestiture of the Automotive Fluid Conveyance business impacted revenues by 4%. And we had a 1% negative headwind from currency. The 20% decline in organic revenues was once again much better than what we expected. And we had 32% decline at the midpoint of our guidance. And both light motor vehicles as well as truck markets have rebounded more quickly than we anticipated. In fact, organic revenues were up some 75% from Q2.  Global light vehicle market production in the quarter was down 4%, and Class 8 OEM build was down some 34% in Q3. But given the strength that we're now seeing, we now project NAFTA Class 8 truck production of some 200,000 units for the year, and this is up 14% from our prior forecast. Operating margins were 14%, down 430 basis points on a year-over-year basis but up 20 basis points from Q2. And we're also pleased to see the 31% decremental margin performance in this business given the magnitude of the revenue reductions due to end markets. And we certainly would expect these trends to continue through the balance of the year.  Moving to Page 10, we have the results of our eMobility segment. Revenues were flat with organic revenue declining 1%, offset by 1% positive currency impact. Operating margins were negative 2.5% as we continue to really increase investment in R&D in this segment. And our focus in this segment continues to be on executing key program wins as well as actively managing what we're looking at now as a multibillion-dollar pipeline of opportunities.  We continue to see the electrification market as a significant growth opportunity, and we'd expect to see a sharp recovery as the market improves. In fact, I mean, some analysts are estimating a year-over-year increase of more than 30% in Q4 alone.  Turning to Page 11, we provide our Q4 outlook on organic revenues versus last year. For Electrical Americas, we expect organic revenues to be between flat and up 3% with continued strength in residential and utility, data centers, health care, warehousing and also in water/wastewater, offset by some weakness in industrial markets, principally in office and lodging. For Electrical Global, we estimate organic revenues will decline between 7% and 10%, with strength in the Asia Pacific region and data center markets but being offset by weakness really in Europe and some declines in the oil and gas market. For Aerospace, we project organic revenues will be down between 23% and 26%, with continued strength in military but with continuing and ongoing weakness in commercial OEM and commercial aftermarket.  For Vehicle, we expect organic revenues will decline between 7% and 10%, with strong demand in China and other markets really continuing to recover from the Q2 lows. And for eMobility, we estimate organic revenues to be between flat and up 3%, with recovery in global vehicle markets and then with particular strength in electric vehicles as well.  And lastly, for Hydraulics, we estimate a decline of between 6% and 9%. As overall, we're estimating organic revenues to be down between 5% and 7%, and this would be another quarter of sequential improvement as the global economy continues to improve. Moving to Page 12, we note our outlook for Q4 and for the full year. As I just noted, we expect organic revenue declines between 5% and 7% with modest sequential improvements versus Q3. We also expect our Q4 decremental margins to be 25%, which is, once again, at the low end of our prior guidance range, which was between 25% and 30%.  Our Q4 tax rate on adjusted earnings is expected to be 14%. And then turning to the full year, we're reaffirming the $2.5 billion midpoint of our 2020 free cash flow guidance and narrowing the range to be between $2.4 billion and $2.6 billion. Now I think it's worth emphasizing once again the predictable nature of our free cash flow. We initiated guidance in the midst of the downturn back in April, and we really expect to be right in line with this number. Free cash flow as a percentage of revenue continues to be very strong. And for 2020, it's on track to exceed 2019, which was 13.4%. I'd also note in our free cash flow-to-adjusted earnings ratio, which is 142% on a year-to-date basis and is also well above the 120% levels achieved in 2019.  And an important element of our free cash flow has been our working capital management, where we've reduced net working capital by more than $350 million year-to-date, and this was driven principally by the reduction in inventory. We plan to buy back $200 million to $400 million of our shares in Q4, and we're also reaffirming our full year guidance, which is between $1.7 billion and $1.9 billion. So I think you'll agree that our cash flow generation remains resilient, and it does really position us well for the upcoming economic recovery.  Next, on Page 13, we show our preliminary 2020 outlook by end market within both the electrical and industrial sectors. And once again, these numbers reflect, if you look at these end markets, the percentage of the sector revenue that is accounted for by these various end markets. Within our electrical sector, data centers, utility, residential, institutional infrastructure end markets, make up some 50% of our revenue, and each of these market is holding up well and expected to continue to grow.  Industrial end markets, which represent some 30%, where the outlook is more mixed with some areas of strength like in machinery and industrial facilities but also some areas of weakness and particularly in oil and gas. We understand that there's been some concern raised about the near-term growth of commercial construction, but I think it's important to note here that commercial construction only represents 20% of electrical sector revenues. And within commercial construction, we do see some areas of strength like in warehousing that can partially offset areas of potential weakness that we would see certainly in the office and lodging segment. It's also worth noting, I'd say here, that retail is only 2% of total commercial construction markets, whereas the warehouse segment accounts for about 5% of the market. So there's clearly some puts and takes in this market.  And lastly, within the industrial sector, our preliminary outlook for 2020 includes growth within all of the end markets with particular strength in truck and electric vehicles. And finally, while we continue to manage through the short-term challenges of the pandemic, we also remain focused on our broader strategic and financial goals, which we summarize on Page 14.  And I'll begin by first saying that we continue to move the company in the direction of becoming an intelligent power management company that's really taking advantage of these important secular growth trends that we talked about in the past : electrification, energy transition, IoT connectivity, digitalization. And our recent announcement of the Brightlayer digitalization initiative is a prime example of how this transformation continues. In simple terms, Brightlayer for us is really where we extract data from our intelligent devices. It's where we use data science and machine learning to create new insights and software, and it's where we partner with customers to develop value-added solutions.  But I'd also say that the overriding goals of the company remain the same, and that's to create a company that has better secular growth, that has higher margins and better earnings consistency. And with the added benefit of strong free cash flow, we'll continue to be smart in how we deploy it : investing in organic growth, paying a top-quartile dividend, buying back shares and actively managing our portfolio while being a disciplined acquirer. And while perhaps delayed by a year or so, our long-term financial goals remain unchanged. They include 2% to 3% organic growth, 20% segment margins, 8% to 9% EPS growth and $3 billion a year in free cash flow.  And so with that, I'll stop and I'll turn it back over to Yan, and we'll open up Q&A. Yan Jin : Okay. Thanks, Craig. [Operator Instructions]. Thanks in advance for your cooperation.  With that, I will turn it over to the operator to give you guys the instruction. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And first, we'll go to the line of Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Jeffrey Sprague : A couple of things. First, just on cash flow, Craig. The numbers have been very robust, and thanks for kind of reiterating your longer-term target. I am wondering, though, as we think about this 2021 you've laid out with a kind of a return to growth, if those greens and yellows are correct, do you see the ability to actually grow free cash flow in dollars next year? Or does kind of the natural working capital swing and maybe other things kind of coming back into play mute the ability to grow cash flow? I would assume the conversion would still be pretty good but really talking about absolute dollars. Richard Fearon : Okay. Jeff, maybe I'll take that. Yes, the conversion will remain strong. As you know, we have a lot of amortization that lowers the net income. And of course, that's noncash.  We continue to believe that we have further progress on things like days on-hand inventory. I mean we have improved markedly. But if -- as we talked about, over $300 million generated so far this year. But we believe we probably can take another couple of hundred million out of that over time. And so that'll be just an efficiency improvement that will help us. And of course, we'll have to put a little bit back into receivables simply to reflect sales growth. But absent Hydraulics coming out -- and you got to remember, if -- assuming Hydraulics closes at the end of March, you will lose the free cash flow from Hydraulics. And that'll, of course, reduce free cash flow. But apart from that, we think that the puts and takes are likely to allow us to maintain the free cash flow about at the levels it's been. Craig Arnold : And as we've shared in the past, I mean, our free cash flow is remarkably consistent through periods of economic expansion and contraction as the higher net income that we generate tends to be the offset for the increased consumption or use of working capital. And so we do think that next year will be a very good year as well for free cash flow. Jeffrey Sprague : And maybe on the topic of Hydraulics. I don't know if there's anything else to say about the closing time line. But what is your thinking in terms of, for lack of a better term, kind of replacing those earnings, whether it's kind of more of a running start on share repurchase in the early part of 2021 or perhaps the M&A pipeline is active? Just you're probably not working to precisely manage the ins and outs, but it'd still be interesting to hear how you see that playing out in 2021. Craig Arnold : Appreciate the question, Jeff. And certainly, as we think about our strategy around what we'd like to do with the company in the near term and in the longer term, it's really to take funds and reinvest in growth. And we've said from a priority standpoint our priorities are largely around the electrical business.  And certainly, as we think about Aerospace, if we can pick up an asset that's got, relatively speaking, higher defense exposure and valuations coming to line, we still like the aerospace market as well. But I would say that from where we sit today, what we've committed is that we won't let cash just build up on the balance sheet. If we don't feel like we have line of sight to meaningful M&A, that we'll continue to buy back shares as a way of returning cash to shareholders.  But I would say in terms of -- as you think about the way 2021 will likely unfold, is that we're not going to take the roughly $2.9 billion of proceeds and then, as soon as we receive those proceeds, go back and buy back a bunch of shares. And so we'll try to be, as we've done in the past, more opportunistic in terms of our share buyback program and buying at the right times into the market. Operator : And our next question is from Scott Davis with Melius Research. Scott Davis : Craig, you mentioned in your remarks around Aerospace around restructuring and rightsizing or, maybe more specifically, I think you used the word rightsizing. What does that mean? What is the new normal? How do you kind of plan for -- I noticed, obviously, Aerospace is green in your chart on Slide 13. But is there a specific target of 20% down or 15% down or something that you're rightsizing to? Or are your factories kind of flexible enough to moderate down -- or moderate back up, I should say, because the decremental margins were pretty tough in the quarter in that business? Craig Arnold : Yes. No, I'd say, obviously, if you think about all of our end markets, the aerospace market probably is the one that is certainly most challenged and probably where you have the least certainty around what the future looks like in terms of the rate of improvement in that market.  We do believe, coming off of a positively horrific year this year, that we do see some modest growth in the commercial aerospace market next year but once again coming off of a very, very low base, which is why we think that, that market will be green for us, and the military market will continue to perform just fine.  But I'd say we have done already -- based upon the actions that we've already taken in the business, we have already sized the business for the level of economic activity that we're experiencing today inside of Aerospace. And so we have very quickly moved, going all the way back to Q2, to really, what I call, rightsize the business for the level of economic activity that we are experiencing.  And to the extent that the world recovers faster than what we're currently envisioning -- and I think what we've said in the past is we don't think that this market really returns to 2019 levels until probably sometime in late '23, '24. And so we really are prepared for a long-term kind of downturn in that business. And we've structured the business in a way that allows us to deliver attractive margins even at 18.5%, and I'd call those very attractive margins for the Aerospace business in the context of this economic environment. And so we are -- we've done the work that we need to do to prepare the business to really continue to deliver attractive margins in this environment. Scott Davis : Okay. And just moving on to the grid and kind of -- what does Smart Grid really mean for you guys? And as it relates to an add-on to historic growth rates, I know utility has never been all that fantastic of a growth rate; historically for you guys, probably more like 2% to 3%, what -- does Smart Grid add meaningfully to that historic growth rate we can expect something higher? Or is there just a mix shift of spend that gets taken from one side into the other and that the overall growth rate in utility is the same? Craig Arnold : We do think that this energy transition that we're going through, which includes Smart Grid, does add meaningful growth to the historical utility business. And so I'd say that if you think about today, the amount of investment that's going into renewables, if you think about today in the context of everybody today is both a consumer and a seller of electricity, of electrons, as we think about Everything as a Grid that we -- that [indiscernible] spent some time sharing with the group during our investor meeting, we do think that the investments that will be required to, first of all, harden the grid, build more resilience into the grid and then to think about how do you manage this environment where electrons are moving in many different directions, you have to manage that power very differently.  If you think about all of the growth in things like electric vehicles that are coming online and the additional load that, that's going to put on the grid, the grid is going to have to get smarter in the way that it manages all of these various loads, and that's going to mean more opportunities for our electrical equipment and gear and software and the solutions that we bring to market. And so while the utility market maybe historically has been, let's say, a relatively slow-growth market, we do think the future for the utility market for at least the near term and into the midterm is going to be very attractive. Operator : Our next question is from Ann Duignan with JPMorgan. Ann Duignan : Actually, Craig, maybe along similar lines but a different region. You mentioned in your comments that Electrical Global Europe was still very weak. Are you seeing any signs of life in that region in terms of the huge investments they're considering making in things like hydrogen and all the infrastructure that would have to be built out to support that?  And also more recently, they announced their intention to retrofit all old buildings. I'm just curious whether all of those investments that they're talking about in Europe are going to be years out and require private funding or whether you're hearing any signs of life over there on the back of any of these humongous secular changes that they're talking about? Craig Arnold : Yes. Appreciate the question, Ann. And I'd say, maybe addressing the specific one around hydrogen, I think it's a little early for us to really understand the role that hydrogen is going to play kind of in the overall energy equation, although there's massive amounts of investments that are going in. I would say, to your broader point around building electrification, it's obviously a very significant opportunity for Eaton both in Europe as well as in the U.S. As I'm sure you're aware, buildings, say -- account for directly or indirectly some 1/3 of energy consumption and nearly 40% of the direct and indirect CO2 emissions.  And so as we highlighted as a part of our energy transition growth discussion at the Investor Day, we think energy transition and the changing electrical power value chain is creating this what we call Everything as a Grid environment. And with it is going to come just, we think, very large opportunity for us.  So with customers once again producing, selling, consuming electrons, you're really entering into an environment that is so much more complex, that's going to require our type of equipment and our type of solutions. Specifically the EU, the legislation that you mentioned, a large emphasis on climate-friendly investments, building innovation, and obviously, Eaton is very well positioned to capitalize on this market growth.  The EU Green Deal, they committed, what, EUR 550 billion to be spent on climate-friendly investments, a lot of that going into building renovation, doubling of spending in things like energy storage and digital solutions. And so all of those things are just really beneficial to our company, and I think we're very well positioned to take advantage of it. Ann Duignan : And so you do think you have the portfolio well enough positioned to take advantage of those opportunities when they arrive? Craig Arnold : Yes. Yes, we do. And I'd say there's certainly some work that we need to do around some of these things, that we're making those investments in things like energy storage and software solutions to be able to manage the power. But I'd say by and large, we are well positioned to participate and take advantage of it. Operator : And next, we'll go to Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank. Nicole DeBlase : Can we maybe start with Electrical Americas? I was pretty impressed by the margin performance there during the quarter. I'm just curious how you think about stability of the margins that you're currently seeing there into the fourth quarter and into 2021, particularly given that some of these temporary cost cuts start to come back? Craig Arnold : Yes. No, appreciate the question. And we did, like some of the other companies, put in place quite a few cost measures as we dealt with the pandemic. And I'd say there was a few of those cost measures that were in place in Q3 than there were in Q2, and there'll be fewer in Q4 than there will in Q3. But for the most part, our base assumption is that most of those costs largely come back during the course of 2021.  But having said that, the margin story in our Electrical Americas business, I'd say you should be expecting margins that are in this range for this business, I'd say, into the foreseeable future. A lot of what we're doing is around improving our execution. As you know, we've also, as a company, already taken a number of restructuring programs that we would expect that would deliver benefits to offset some of the onetime cost measures, although some of those could be more back-end loaded. But no, I would think that the margins that you're seeing today in the Americas business is very much in line with the way we expect that business to perform. Nicole DeBlase : Got it. Craig, that's really helpful. And then for my follow-up, just thinking about channel inventory, and I guess did you guys start to see any early signs of restocking in the channel, particularly in the electrical business in the quarter? Or maybe you could characterize just overall inventory levels as well. Craig Arnold : Yes. Yes, we did. In fact, I mean, we certainly saw in Q2 a pretty large inventory drawdown, specifically in the Electrical Americas business. And certainly, during the course of Q3, we did see some restocking that took place with most of our distributors. And so -- as well, we come into Q4, I would say, that distributor inventories today are pretty much well in line with where they've been historically. When you go back to the number of days on hand that would be sitting in a distributor inventory right now in the fourth quarter versus where we were, let's say, in Q1, those days on hands are about the same. And so we think inventories today are very well aligned for the level of economic activity that we're forecasting into Q4 and into next year. So we don't think there's another inventory build in front of us but nor do we think that there's an inventory drawdown either. So we think it's pretty well balanced right now. Richard Fearon : And Nicole, I might make just one addition to that. The only area where inventories have not yet really been rebuilt are in auto dealer lots. I mean auto inventories are about 50 days. Normally, they're mid-60s. And because sales have been so strong, the auto OEMs have had difficulty building enough cars to get the lots restocked. So they'll -- probably in Q4 and maybe into Q1, you'll see some benefit from that. Operator : And next, we'll go to Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Nigel Coe : I wanted to go back to the 2021 framework, if that's the right words. And obviously, industrial is one of the amber end markets. And obviously, that's not a monolithic end market. There's lots of different parts of that. Is the caution just tied to oil and gas and maybe heavy industrial markets? So would machine tool OEM be sort of a flash number as well? I mean any kind of color you can give us on the different end markets there would be great. Craig Arnold : Yes. I mean I think you hit it in your commentary there, Nigel. I'd say that certainly, everybody is -- we all understand what's going on right now in the oil and gas markets and in some of the industrial markets. But MOEM segment of the market, the manufacturing segment of the market, we do think that those markets are -- become positive during the course of 2021, and that's a little bit of the offset and why we think in aggregate that market still grows.  And then also, if you think about markets like data centers, right, in the context of what's going on, in data center markets, I talked about those orders being up some 40% in the quarter. So data center markets continue to be very robust. Nigel Coe : Right. Yes. I mean I just would have put industrial as a green, but just I was curious what drove it down to be an amber. And then... Craig Arnold : Yes. I mean largely, it's oil and gas. Richard Fearon : It's largely oil and gas and petrochemical. And on balance, if you put it -- net it all together, Nigel, it's probably going to be down but not dramatically down. Nigel Coe : Okay. That's fair. That's very fair. My follow-on question is sticking with 2021, the outlook for Aerospace and military. There are some question marks around military with DoD budget constraints. I'm just wondering kind of how good is your visibility into sort of the next year for military. And are there any constraints on commercial aero recovery? I mean there's a lot of, again, concerns around parked planes and cannibalized parts from parked planes. Do you think that's a risk for '21? Craig Arnold : Yes. No, maybe dealing with the first part of your question around the military side, I'd say we do typically have fairly good visibility. Those orders tend to be longer lead time. We do sell, obviously, into some of the depots that service the military market, which tends to be, let's say, more short term. But by and large, we have fairly good visibility.  And if you take a look at the defense budget and defense spending, we don't anticipate that those things are going to be dramatically changed as we look out into the future. And so we do think that, that market holds up fairly well, and -- but not, let's say, runaway growth but solid growth nonetheless. In commercial aerospace, I mean, there's no question. I think what you're seeing today in the market is that there are, in fact, a lot of parked planes. What has happened in the industry historically is that a lot of these parked plans never come back into service. They end up being parted out, which then has an impact on the aftermarket.  I can tell you from where we sit today, given the level of, let's say, revenue passenger miles, revenue passenger kilometers, activity levels have been so low that we've not seen a bunch of cannibalization of parked aircraft. But we do anticipate -- as that market improves and some of these older aircraft are not brought back into the market, we do anticipate that, that will happen again at this point in the economic recovery.  And so we have a relatively muted view, quite frankly, of what the aerospace market is going to look like next year. Some -- like I said, some modest growth coming off of a pretty horrific downturn this year, but we've already factored in those numbers into our outlook for the year. Operator : And next, we'll go to John Inch with Gordon Haskett. John Inch : So Craig and Rick, a lot of temporary costs, if not most of them, coming back next year. What kind of incrementals are you planning for? And I ask in the context that your incrementals -- or your decrementals have been beating. And given all the cost takeout you've done and you've got some pretty leverageable operationally businesses such as vehicle in the portfolio, you'd be looking at some pretty big incrementals despite some of these temporary costs coming back next year. What sort of framework should we be thinking about? Craig Arnold : I appreciate the question. And it's obviously one of the things that we're trying to work through right now as we work on our internal plans, which are not quite finished for next year, but I do think it is important to once again note the fact that we have taken out very sizable, let's say, onetime costs this year, much of which have been temporary costs and much of that cost will come back next year, and that return of costs will have a muting impact on the incremental margins out in the fiscal -- in our calendar year -- '21 year.  Having said that, we also have some offsets, and some of the offsets being the fact that we've announced and launched this restructuring program, which is going to obviously add -- to be additive to the incremental margins year-over-year. But I would say as we think about -- for planning purposes, we'll certainly provide you some more guidance as we come out of our Q4 earnings call. But at this point, I would say that you could -- you probably should be planning on incrementals that are a little bit lower than what you would typically see because we will, in fact, see costs come back next year that were onetime costs that we're dealing with this year. John Inch : That makes sense, Craig. Can I just -- as a supplement to my question, are you managing toward incrementals at this point? I say this because Fortive has this framework that they say, well, it's just going to be 35% incrementals, and if it's higher, we'll spend the money away. I think that's kind of their implication. Is that how you're thinking about it? In other words, let's just say because of vehicle and other operational gearing and we had a better-than-expected recovery, you had big incrementals. Were you just going to let those flow through? Or would you be predisposed to try and take that money and apply it to kind of keep the incrementals in check or in a range? Craig Arnold : Yes. I mean if I understand the question, I mean, every one of our businesses has a normal incremental rate, a percentage of fixed versus variable costs. And so every business is expected to essentially manage their business in a very proactive way, to manage margins on the way up and the way down, flexing our variable cost. And so I think that expectation is absolutely built into every one of our businesses. And then to the extent that we do better than that because we go beyond, we're more effective or more efficient, those benefits would tend to flow through, and which is why we're delivering better-than-normal decremental margins this year. But the results are the results. They flow through as they come. We don't, I mean, we don't really have much latitude around managing them other than that. John Inch : No. That makes sense. And then maybe just as a follow-up. This might be for Rick. If Biden and the Democrats win, their platform is to jack up corporate tax rates. I think they're trying to going to go after the GILTI tax. Startling that you guys as an Irish company are far better positioned than other companies that are U.S. based or domiciled. Rick, do you have any preliminary thoughts about how you respectively might manage this to try and keep your tax rate down, which has obviously been very value additive to shareholders over the past several years? Richard Fearon : Well, no, you're exactly right, John, to point out that as an Irish-domiciled company, we don't really have issues with things like GILTI. Our non-U.S. earnings are essentially not taxed at U.S. rates or by U.S. provisions.  And so the only real impact of what has been suggested by Biden, that the corporate rate comes up, is that our income in the United States would face a higher tax rate, but our income outside the U.S. would really not be affected at all. And that's very different than a typical U.S.-domiciled company that would see both its U.S. income and its non-U.S. income affected by the Biden proposals. John Inch : Yes. Makes sense. Craig Arnold : I think we can say confidently that the -- we have an advantage today, and that advantage at least maintains if not improves in the event of a... Richard Fearon : It should improve... Craig Arnold : Improve. Richard Fearon : By several points. Craig Arnold : Yes. Richard Fearon : For us compared to a typical U.S. multi-industrial. Operator : Our next question is from David Raso with Evercore ISI. David Raso : More near term. I was curious why the Electrical Americas organic sales growth rate in the fourth quarter is a little slower than the third quarter. I mean it feels in the channel, residential is accelerating. It seemed like utility maybe is as well. And I'm just trying to understand why the slower growth rate. Is data center starting to come off a bit? Or is industrial not even showing a second derivative improvement? I'm just trying to understand in case I'm missing something there. Craig Arnold : Yes. Appreciate the question, Dave. And I'd say -- and obviously, there's uncertainty in terms of where they were going to ultimately end up. But the biggest delta in terms of Q2 versus Q3 really is this inventory rebuild that we talked about that we saw in the distribution channel, largely in the Americas. And so we did, in fact, see some restocking that took place in the Electrical Americas business, and that's what's having, when we think about a quarter-over-quarter basis, a little bit of a muting impact on what the growth trajectory looks like.  But I'd say no, we've not seen any slowdown in the key markets that are strong. Whether that be residential or data centers or utility, those markets are continuing to perform just fine. And as we think about the growth rates that we've laid out for the quarter, it's very much in line with what we saw at the end of September and into October. David Raso : And just to clarify the comment about the margins for Electrical Americas from this 22% level we just saw, when you said we should expect that type of level, I mean, do you feel this is a business, all else equal, even include any seasonality around the first quarter, that there should be a 2-handle on the operating margin? Is it -- or is the mix is -- maybe the restock, data center strength something that is providing a positive enough mix? And we shouldn't maybe take that comment maybe quite as literally as you meant it. I just want to make sure I understood your comment. Craig Arnold : No. I mean if you think about -- one of the -- if you say -- if you think about what is it that's driving these margins to the levels that we -- you're seeing now, and one of the big things is we effectively sold the Lighting business. And so the fact that we divested this dilutive Lighting business has certainly helped margins quite a bit in the electrical business. And our teams are doing a very effective job of running the business, executing and taking out discretionary costs. And so I'd say we're not prepared to make a call on a given quarter. But if you think about the business on a 12-month basis, we think that level of profitability is very much in line with where this business should perform. Operator : And next, we'll go to Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Joseph Ritchie : Maybe just following up on John's question from earlier. Obviously, a big day here in the U.S. And I know his question was kind of limited to the tax implications. But I'm curious, Craig, just to hear your views on election outcomes and what that could potentially mean for your business over the next 12 to 24 months. Craig Arnold : Yes. And I mean -- and at this point, I mean, it is clearly speculation because we're not exactly sure of what the proposals would be from either one of the administrations. But I would say that by and large, I think infrastructure spending is certainly an agenda item for both administrations. And I think that -- we're hopeful and would expect probably an infrastructure bill of some sort coming from either one of the candidates.  I think a lot of the things that we talked about that are really secular trends that are impacting our industry, we talk about electrification, digitization, energy transition, these things, I think, are much bigger than what's going on in the U.S. and in the U.S. administration. I can tell you despite the fact that the current administration perhaps has not been as focused on green, we continue to see increasing investments around the world in essentially energy transition and the greening of the economy.  So I think they're the secular growth trends that we're experiencing inside of the global economy that are essentially bigger than any administration in the U.S. and I think are going to be positive for us independent of who's in the White House. Joseph Ritchie : Got it. That's helpful, Craig. And then maybe just my one follow-on. I know we've talked a little bit about incrementals and decrementals but just maybe honing in on the Electrical Global business, which saw decrementals tick up in 4Q. Maybe just a little bit more color what's happening there and whether we should see just kind of improved performance on the decrementals going forward. Craig Arnold : Yes. I mean I'd say that -- when you talk about the company, we've given you -- 25% decrementals is what we expect for all of Eaton. And in any given quarter, depending upon what's going on in the business and what went on last year, you can have some parts and pieces moving around in our individual segments.  And so I would say there's nothing specifically that you should worry about with respect to the Electrical Global business. That business is doing well. They're executing -- incrementals could move around slightly higher, slightly lower than the rest of the company depending upon what quarter. But by and large, we're very comfortable with the guidance that we provided and delivering the 25% decrementals in Q4. Operator : Our next question is from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Julian Mitchell : Maybe, Craig, circling back to your comments around slightly lower-than-normal incrementals next year. So is the way to think about that, that your gross margin is around 30%? And so a slightly lower-than-normal incremental is something in the sort of low mid-20s? Is that a reasonable sort of placeholder for now? Craig Arnold : Yes. I'd say, Julian, would be higher than that. I mean our typical incrementals, we'd say, would be probably north of the number that you started with. And so it would be certainly higher than that number. And then once again, we're not done with our plans for next year, and we would hope to be in a position when we do our Q4 earnings to give you a more definitive number. But I -- it's certainly higher than the number that you just quoted. Julian Mitchell : And then just homing in perhaps on the Aerospace segment and the margins there. Understood they were down a fair amount year-on-year. But I suppose what I found most interesting was very high sequential incremental margin in Aerospace, 40%-plus. So I just wondered, you're at that high-teens margin run rate in the third quarter. Is that good sort of baseline now when you look out to your end-market prognosis and the cost actions that I imagine a fair proportion of those are in the Aerospace division?  And also, related to that, longer term, you talked about the aero market top line getting back to the old peak maybe in 3 to 4 years' time. Should we assume aero can get back to prior peak margins perhaps before that? And what do you think the peak margin entitlement is for that business? Craig Arnold : Yes. Yes, I would say that if you think about the margin expectations for the business as we go forward and we're dealing at these levels of economic activity, I think it's reasonable to assume that the most recent quarter is probably a good predictor of where that business is expected to perform at, at this level of economic activity and this level of revenues.  To the question around the longer term, without a doubt, we would certainly expect this business to get back to prior peak margins that the business posted, which were close to 25%, as the market recovers. Whether or not we can get back there earlier or not, I think it's really going to be a function of, in many ways, what happens with the underlying mix of the business and what happens principally with aftermarket.  And as I think everybody understands, in aerospace world, that most of the margins are made in aftermarket, which means revenue passenger miles, which means consumers have to get on planes and starting. And so I think it really will be a function of to what extent does the aftermarket business return? And are consumers and businesses comfortable putting people on planes and flying again? And so too early to call at this juncture in terms of when it returns. We certainly know that will return. But at this juncture, just too early to ascertain when. Operator : Our next question is from Andrew Obin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Andrew Obin : Just a question on eMobility. You guys sort of, I think, made some intriguing statements about potential ramp in revenues into the fourth quarter. Just taking a longer-term view, how much of a ramp should we expect over the next couple of years? And you keep talking about, I guess, the investment cycle. How long is the investment cycle until this business really starts contributing a material -- until this business starts moving the needle on profitability for Eaton? Craig Arnold : Yes. And as I'm sure you appreciate, Andrew, with the automotive industry, I mean, these product development life cycles are quite long. I mean they can be 5 years or so, especially when you think about launching a new technology. And so -- and what we've said before is that really you're talking about something around, from start to finish, probably a 10-year cycle by the time it really starts to contribute meaningfully to the profitability of the company. But the ramp will largely depend upon the rate at which the automotive OEMs start launching new vehicles into the marketplace.  But if you think from a standing start to when does it really start delivering meaningful margin contribution to the company, I think something in the order of magnitude of 5 to 10 years would be a reasonable expectation. Andrew Obin : Got you. And sustainability of the revenue ramp near term? Craig Arnold : You said the sustainability of the revenue ramp? Andrew Obin : Yes. Richard Fearon : Yes. And Andrew, one way to think about it is probably the easiest way to think about it. About 2/3 of the revenues that are now in eMobility go into internal combustion cars. So this is electrical equipment going into that. And 1/3 goes into the battery electric and hybrid cars. And so you're going to have different growth rates in those two. But right now, we're in a big recovery period from the sharp down of Q2. And so you're going to see pretty good growth in both of those two categories over the next several quarters. Andrew Obin : Got you. And just a follow-up question on capital allocation and M&A. I know you guys said that electrical and Aerospace are a focus. But there are a couple of deals in the industry, I guess, both OSI companies that went at very, very high multiples. How does Eaton think participating in these kind of deals? And how do you think about just M&A in the software and IoT space? Is that an option given where the multiples are? Craig Arnold : No. I mean I appreciate your reference to the M&A. And one of the things that we've prided ourselves on over many, many years is the fact that we try to be a very disciplined acquirer. And recognizing for sure that software companies grow faster, they trade at higher multiples in the two deals that you referenced and understanding those businesses and seeing the multiples that they went for, we just think that there are much better ways of deploying capital and creating shareholder value than the kind of multiples that those two transactions went at. I mean they just went in extraordinary multiples, and we just think we have better, more attractive alternatives than that, that will deliver a better return for our shareholders.  But we will say our capital allocation strategy continues to be focused on electrical, and we are, in fact, looking at a number of opportunities there. There's nothing, obviously, that is imminent, but we have, in fact, seen the deal pipeline pick up a bit. We continue to look at things in and around Aerospace. And once again, as I mentioned, valuations would have to come in line and be reflective of the current reality and uncertainty in that market before we would do anything. But we're obviously having some conversations and discussions in that space as well and we always have the option of buying back stock. I mean it's not the first choice. We would love to grow the company. But once again, if we're not able to deploy capital in a shareholder-friendly way towards an acquisition, we don't have to do a deal. We're very comfortable with our ability to invest in the company organically, grow the company organically. And acquisitions are a way of accelerating a strategy, of augmenting a strategy, but the prime path for us will continue to be the things that we're doing to focus on growing the company organically. Operator : Our final question will be from Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc. Jeffrey Hammond : Just on data center, the order rates have been really strong. And I know this is a good secular market, but there tends to be these lulls from time to time. Any anything you can speak to in the quoting activity that would point to continued strength or any kind of lull into '21? Craig Arnold : Yes. Not really, Jeff. In fact, we had a very strong quarter. If you take a look at our global data center orders for the quarter, we were up some 9%. And what we really saw over the last number of months is a really return of hyperscale. And then as we've talked about on these calls and in prior earnings calls, hyperscale tends to be lumpy. These orders come and they go. And they come -- when they come, they come in large increments. And so, I mean, there's really nothing that we've seen in data centers that would suggest that the market is in any way pulling back.  And if you think about it, it makes a lot of sense, especially in the context of the environment that we're living in today, where everybody is working remotely, everybody's Zoom-ing and WebEx-ing and Team-ing. All of these technologies that we're all using to conduct business remotely just adds more kind of accelerate to a market that is already growing quite rapidly. And as the world continues to digitize in connectivity, and we're living in a 5G environment in the not-too-distant future, all of these things will continue to add to kind of the momentum that we're seeing in the data center market. So we think that becomes a -- continues to be a very attractive market for the foreseeable future. Jeffrey Hammond : Okay. And then truck cycle seems to be inflecting here. Just give us a sense on how that -- your truck business within Vehicle acts the same or different given the JV structure. Craig Arnold : Yes. I'd say that one of the things that we try to do by putting the joint venture together is really to kind of dampen some of these big cyclical swings and the outside impact that the truck business in North America had on the overall company. And so I would -- what you ought to expect is that -- to see -- in the bottom of a downturn to see a much smaller impact on the company. And in the event of a big upswing, you're probably going to see a more muted impact on that side as well.  But keep in mind that the JV today is basically in North America Class 8 automated transmissions. I mean everything else globally, clutch business, aftermarket business, all the other elements of that business, we still own. And so we do expect to see attractive growth in our Vehicle business as this market returns to growth into 2021 and into the fourth quarter. Yan Jin : Okay. Good. Thank you all. I think we reached the end of our call, and we do appreciate everybody's questions. As always, Chip and I will be available to address your follow-up questions. Thank you for joining us today and have a great day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all of your participant phone lines are in a listen-only mode and later there'll be an opportunity for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Just a brief reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I'm now happy to turn the conference over to Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Yan Jin. Yan Jin : Hey, good morning. I'm Yan Jin, Eaton's Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you all for joining us for Eaton's fourth quarter 2020 earnings call. With me today are Craig Arnold, our Chairman and CEO; and Rick Fearon, Vice Chairman, our Chief Financial and Planning Officer. Our agenda today including opening remarks by, Craig, highlighting the company's performance in the fourth quarter. As we have done in our past calls, we'll be taking questions at the end of Craig's comments. The press released today and the presentation we'll go through today, have been posted on our website at www.eaton.com. Please note that both the press release and the presentation include reconciliation to non-GAAP measures. A webcast of this call is accessible on our website and we will be ready for replay. I would like to remind you that our comments today will including the statements related to the expected future results of the company and are therefore forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our forecasted projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties and are also described in our earnings release and the presentation. They are also outlined in our related 8-K filing. So with that, I will turn it over to Craig. Craig Arnold : Great. Thanks, Yan. Appreciate it. And we'll start on Page 3 and we naturally have a lot of good news to talk about today. But I'd say we'd be remiss if we didn't begin by at least acknowledging Rick Fearon and his upcoming retirement. As most of you know, Rick will reach mandatory retirement age of 65 in March and will retire on March 31st, and so I'd like to extend a sincere thanks to Rick for his 19 years of service to Eaton. And Rick has obviously played just an instrumental role in the transformation and shaping of our company and the company that we have today and he has been a trusted partner to the management team, to our Board and certainly to me personally. And looking back, Rick has participated in more than 75 of these earnings calls and this will be his last one. And so, we certainly which Rick and his family well, as he makes this transition onto life after Eaton, if there is life after Eaton, I am not sure Rick, but Rick will also be around for another couple of months and also will attend the Investor Meeting on March 1st. Moving to Page 4. I'd also like to welcome Tom Okray in as well. Tom becomes Eaton's CFO effective April 1st. Tom was previously the CFO at W.W. Grainger and joined the team in January. Throughout his career, he served various leadership positions at Advance Auto Parts, at Amazon and GM. Tom is a seasoned CFO with a strong track record of success, and we anticipate it will bring a very unique perspective and set of skills to the role here at Eaton. He is operational, he's growth-oriented, and he just has outstanding knowledge of distribution channels. Like Rick, Tom is also a global leader, who has lived around the world, including several countries in Europe, as well as Korea. And so we're very happy to welcome Tom to Eaton team as well and look forward to his contributions in the future. Now, on the move to more good news and turning to Page 5. Here we summarize a number of recent noteworthy accomplishments. And I'll begin with the recent announcement to acquire Tripp Lite for $1.65 billion and Cobham Mission Systems for $2.8 billion, two very strategic acquisitions that improved the profitability, and quite frankly, the growth outlook for our company. The acquisition of Tripp Lite will enhance the breadth of our edge computing and distributed IT product portfolio and it also will expand our single-phase UPS business in the United States. We're paying approximately 12 times 2020 EBITDA, 11 times estimated 2021 EBITDA and we expect this transaction to close in the middle part of 2021. Yesterday, we also announced the acquisition of Cobham Mission Systems. Cobham is a leading manufacturer of air-to-air refuelling system, environmental systems and actuation. And Cobham also has highly complementary products to our company and has a strong position, importantly on growing defense platforms. We're paying approximately 14 times 2020 EBITDA, 13 times estimated '21 EBITDA and we expect this transaction to close in the early part of Q4. And if we can just turn to Q4, specifically, we certainly have a stronger than expected quarter and we're pleased with our solid results. Our team just continued to execute well despite the pandemic. Q4 earnings per share of $1.18 on a GAAP basis and $1.28 on an adjusted basis. Our Q4 revenues of $4.7 billion were down 5% organically, which was at the high end of the range that we provided, and it's up 3% versus Q3. And our decremental margins were 21%, also better than the guidance of 25% that we provided. I'm also very pleased now with very strong free cash flow. I mean, our operating cash flows were $943 million and our free cash flows were $845 million, both of which exceeded prior-year levels. And for 2020, and we generated $2.6 billion dollars of free cash flow, which was at the top end of our guidance range and an all-time record for free cash flow to sales at 14.3%. So a lot of really positive kind of things to talk about there as the business and the company teams to execute well. Turning to Page 6, we summarized our Q4 financial results and I want you to note a few items on this page. First, acquisitions increased sales by 2%, which was more than offset by the divestiture of Lighting and Automotive Fluid Conveyance, which reduced sales by 8%. Second, our segment margins up 17.4% were very strong for sure, and only 40 basis points below prior year, despite lower volumes. And then just as a bit of a reminder, I would note that we record all of our charges related to acquisitions, divestitures and restructuring at corporate instead of at the segment level which totally makes it easier to model the company going forward. Moving to Page 7, we summarize our Electrical Americas segment. Revenues were down 18% and this was made up of a 1% decline in organic revenues, and then 17% mainly due to the divestiture of Lighting. In this segment, we saw strong growth in data centers and residential markets. And which was offset by weakness in industrial and commercial markets. Operating margins increased 120 basis points to 21.1%, and then this very strong margin performance was due to really effective cost containment actions but also aided by the divestiture of Lighting. This combination resulted in a very strong decremental margin performance of 15%. While orders were down 1% on a rolling 12-month basis, data center orders were particularly strong and actually up double-digit. Our backlog grew by 12% and this was driven by strength in both residential and data center markets. Lastly, and as I mentioned at the beginning, we are very pleased to announce the acquisition of Tripp Lite. This business is just a tremendous strategic fit with our existing Electrical franchise and will allow us to continue to capitalize on this digitalization trend that requires edge computing. And then when you think about some of the future estimates suggesting that some 75% of enterprise generated data will be created and processed via edge computing, we expect this rapid growth to continue for some time to come. Next on Page 8, we show the result of our Electrical Global segment. Revenues declined 5%, with a 7% decline in organic revenues, partially offset by 2% positive currency and this was better than the midpoint of our expectations for the quarter. The lower organic sales were driven by weakness, not surprisingly, oil and gas and industrial markets, and if you exclude oil and gas and industrial business it's kind of more project-driven businesses. Europe was down slightly and Asia-Pacific was actually up low plus single-digit. Operating margins declined 40 basis points on a year-over-year basis. And here, once again decremental margins were well managed at 25%. In this segment, our orders declined 6% on a rolling 12-month basis, with continued weakness in oil and gas and industrial markets. And excluding oil and gas, industrial markets, orders were down 1% and we saw strength in data centers and residential markets, and in fact, data centers were actually up some 30%. We also continued to expand our backlog, which was up 14%, driven once again by strength in residential and data center markets. Lastly, we were pleased to announce in mid-December, an agreement to buy 50% of HuanYu High Tech, which is based in China. HuanYu manufactures low voltage circuit breakers and contactors in China and also throughout Asia-Pacific. This investment will provide us access to a really strong portfolio of products, and it will open up significant growth opportunities for our company throughout Asia-Pacific. And we'd expect this transaction to close sometime in Q2. Turning to Page 9, we summarize our Hydraulics segment. Our revenues were up 2%, which was all organic. This was much better than the down 7.5% at the midpoint of our guidance as markets just continued to recover faster than anticipated. And especially, I'd say in China and in Europe, operating margins were 10.5%, up 70 basis points from Q3. The momentum in this segment, really continued really throughout the quarter, resulting in a 25% increase in Q4 orders, with strength in both agricultural and construction equipment markets. We're working towards closing the Hydraulic transaction by the end of the first quarter. I would also add, though, begin or given some of the time needed to complete all of the regulatory approvals, we wouldn't be surprised to see the slip into the early part of the second quarter. Next on Page 10, we have the results for our Aerospace segment. As expected revenues declined 13% down 25% organically, partially offset by a 11% increase from the acquisition of Souriau and 1% positive currency. The organic revenue decline was primarily driven by the continued downturn, as we all know and commercial markets, partially offset by double-digit growth in military sales. Operating margins declined to 13% -- excuse me, to 18.3% but we see these at still very healthy levels of performance. And lastly, yesterday, we announced the acquisition of Cobham Mission Systems. Cobham, technology leader in important defense, aerospace product lines and will add a number of complementary capabilities to our Aerospace business. The acquisition will significantly increase our exposure to, once again, growing defense platforms. It will enhance our Fuel Systems business and strongly position our Aerospace business for future growth. Moving to Page 11, we summarize our Vehicle segment. Revenues here declined 7%, including a 1% organic decline, a negative 5% from the divestiture of our Automotive Fluid Conveyance business and 1% headwind from negative currency. The 1% decline in organic revenues was once again much better than the 8.5% decline at the midpoint of our guidance, as both light motor vehicle and truck markets have continued to rebound more quickly than we anticipated. We had particular strength actually in South America and in Asia-Pacific. NAFTA Class 8 production was down 6% in Q4, but once again, this was better than expected. We're certainly happy also to see the rebound in operating margins of 16.6%, down just slightly versus prior year and up 260 basis points sequentially. And our decremental margin performance here was once again very solid at 23%. Turning to Page 12, we show the results of our e-Mobility segment. Revenues increased 13%, including 11% organic and 2% currency tailwind. Organic growth was also here, much higher than the 1.5% growth at the midpoint of our guidance. We experienced solid growth across all regions, which was driven by both high-voltage electrical solutions for passenger cars, as well as low voltage solutions for commercial vehicles. Operating margins were a negative 5.9%, and once again, it's just a reflection of the fact that we continue to invest more in R&D and program implementation in this fast-growing segment of the company. We have a robust pipeline of opportunities, and we continue to see electrification as a significant growth opportunity into the future. Before we turn our attention to '21, I'd like to take a minute to really summarize our results for 2020 in and those are shown on Page 13. First, while the pandemic caused, certainly, unprecedented economic volatility and downturn, we remained focused on delivering for all of our stakeholders, we will remain focused on keeping our employees safe, delivering for our customers and certainly supporting our communities. And we're also proud of how well we perform for our shareholders. We took the appropriate cost reduction, and cost measurement and cost management measures to ensure solid decremental margins of 20% and resilient cash flow of $2.6 billion. Our free cash flow to adjusted earnings conversion was very robust at 149% and free cash flow to sales was 14.3%, 90 basis points over 2019 and another all-time record. We launched a $280 million multi-year restructuring program to reduce fixed costs. This is really targeted mostly in those businesses that have been impacted by the pandemic and these actions will yield $200 million of mature year benefits and make, certainly, stronger in a long run. We also continued to transform our portfolio, announcing or completing divestitures valued at $4.7 billion. We acquired Power Distribution, Inc., and we also announced our intention to acquire 50% of HuanYu High Tech. In addition, we returned $2.8 billion to shareholders via buyback and dividend payments. And lastly, we delivered very strong shareholder returns, results that were 20 basis points above the median of our peer group, and so we're certainly proud of our performance as well. Overall, certainly proud of the team and certainly even more encouraged by our prospects for the future. As we continue to transform Eaton into a company of higher growth, higher margins and more consistent earnings, the company certainly feels like in 2020, we took an important step forward demonstrating that it is, in fact, a different company and we're well on our way to delivering against that goal. Moving to Page 14, we list our revenue and margin guidance for 2021. Overall here, we expect organic growth between 4% and 6%, with weakness in Q1, followed by strength thereafter, and obviously, given the comparisons, particular strength in Q2. In both our Electrical segments, we expect organic growth to be 3% to 5%. And starting with the Americas, we expect to see continued strength in residential, data center and utility markets, solid growth in industrial control markets and ongoing weakness in commercial construction markets. In Electrical Global, we anticipate to strengthen residential, data centers, utility and industrial control markets, so very much like in the Americas, offset by softness in commercial construction and in the oil and gas market. And for Hydraulics, we expect organic growth could be between 4% and 6%, with broadly improving markets around the world. And in Aerospace, we expect organic growth of 2% to 4%, with strength in military offset by continued weakness in commercial markets. And for Vehicle, we anticipate strong organic growth, some 10% to 12% with strength in both light vehicle markets and truck markets. And just as a reminder here, our Eaton-Cummins joint venture will actually consolidate the revenues associated with this particular joint venture. And so, much of this growth will show up in the joint venture, not in Eaton's revenue. And in e-Mobility organic growth is expected to be up 14% to 16% driven by strength in electric vehicles globally. Turning to segment margins, we expect Eaton to be between 17.8% and 18%, at the midpoint 140 basis point improvement over 2020; and importantly, 20 basis points over the pre-pandemic levels in 2019. If we could turn to Page 15, and really before we discuss the rest of our 2020 guidance, we'd like to show you the math behind our new definition of adjusted EPS. In 2020, we're revising our definition of adjusted EPS to add back amortization of intangibles. We believe this will provide investors with a more accurate measure of performance, and it will also quite frankly, make it easier for you to compare our performance with our peers. The table shows adjusted EPS using our current and new definitions for both 2020 and for our guidance range for 2021. It's important to note here as well that the applicable tax rate for intangibles is 23.5% and this is really based upon the tax jurisdictions where the intangibles are located. For 2021, we expect full-year adjusted EPS to be between $5.40 and $5.80 and this includes $0.70 from the after-tax impact of intangibles, $0.25 of accretion from the addition of Tripp Lite and Cobham, but this 25% is reduced by $0.15 due to lower-than-planned share repurchases and additional financing costs. So on a net basis, the two acquisitions will add $0.10 to our expectations for earnings for 2021. We're assuming that Tripp Lite closes once again at the start of Q3 and Cobham closes at the start of Q4. Turning to Page 16, we cover the balance of our 2021 guidance. Organic growth, as we talked about 46%, with divestiture subtracting 8% and positive currency adding $200 million. Adjusted operating cash flow is expected to be between $2.3 billion and $2.7 billion, and CapEx will be approximately $500 million. See, on an adjusted free cash flow, this is projected to be $1.8 billion to $2.2 billion with a midpoint of $2 billion. The way I would say, to think about this is 2021 for us is really a bit of a transition year with several unusual items impacting cash flow, including approximately $200 million due to the sale of the Hydraulics business. We have an incremental $125 million related to our multi-year restructuring plan, approximately $125 million due to the repayment of the CARERS Act payroll deferral from 2020. And, as I noted, $110 million increase in capital spending, which we really see as a return to more historical levels in the levels we're at prior to the COVID-19 driven reduction. I'd also note that the increase in capital spend is going to support strategic growth, and we're really pleased to put dollars to work here. For example, in Q4, we announced $100 million investment to expand our North America Electrical manufacturing and distribution centers. Excluding these items, as I think about, this is a transition year, the midpoint of our guidance would really be approximately $2.6 billion. And lastly, our Q1 guidance is as follows. We expect earnings to be between $1.17 and $1.27. For revenues to be down 3% to 4%, for segment margins to come in between 15.7% and 16.1%. And consistent with the full-year, we expect our tax rate to be between 15.5% and 16.5%. And finally, I would like to conclude on Page 17, with a summary, we'd say why we think Eaton remains a very attractive long-term investment. First, we're an intelligent power management company. And this means that we are well-positioned to take advantage of perhaps what we think is the most important secular growth trend that we will experience in our lifetime. An energy transition driven by climate change, increasing electrification really of everything and explosive growth in connectivity. And it's also helpful, and then I'll remind you that we've been at it for some time in terms of being a leader in ESG practices, which is now becoming increasingly important around the world. In fact, I'd say that Eaton's commitment to sustainability is deeply embedded in the belief that what's good for the planet is also good for Eaton, and that environmentally friendly solutions will create growth opportunities for our company. As you know, our commitment to improve our business portfolio with a focus on high growth, higher earnings and more earnings consistency is ongoing, that's exactly what we've been doing over the last number of years and what will continue to do. Today, some 85% of our segment profits come from Electrical and Aerospace, and within that percentage will actually continue to grow with these announced acquisitions. And while not complete, I think it's clear to say that our strategy is working. Our operating margin guidance for 2021 at 17.8% as a midpoint is an all-time record, and 20 basis points above 2019. In addition, our cash flow continues to be a real point of differentiation. As we demonstrated in 2020, it's not only strong but it's resilient under all economic conditions, and you can expect this point of differentiation to continue. Lastly, we expect to deliver 8% to 10% EPS growth over the 5-year planning horizon, including 14% in 2021. So with that, I will turn it back to Yan for Q&A. Yan Jin : Hey, thanks, Craig. Before we begin the Q&A session of the call today, I appreciate that if you can just limit your opportunity to just one question and one follow-up. Thanking the ones for your cooperation. With that, I will turn it over to the operator to give you guys the instruction. Operator : [Operator Instructions] But first, we'll go to the line of Nicole DeBlase of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Nicole DeBlase : Yes, thanks. Good morning, guys. Craig Arnold : Good morning, Nicole. Richard Fearon : Hi. Nicole DeBlase : And Rick, best of luck in retirement. It was great working with you. Richard Fearon : Great. Thanks, Nicole. Nicole DeBlase : So maybe starting with some of the order trends that you saw within Electrical, I'm not sure that the trailing 12 months trend really tells the story here, especially since we are seeing improvement into next year and your organic growth guidance. So Craig, maybe you could talk a little bit about what you're seeing in real-time in the end markets and what's starting to show or what's continuing to show sequential improvement in the fourth quarter and into early 1Q? Craig Arnold : Yes, Nicole. Appreciate the question. And that's obviously the big one that we're all spending a lot of time focusing on. And I'd say that, if you think about our Electrical Americas business in the fourth quarter, it continued to be impacted, quite frankly, by the spread of COVID-19 and some intermittent shutdowns and supply chain issues that we experienced, principally, here in the US market. And so, I would suggest that if you think about those areas that have been strong and continue to be strong and the things that are really driving the increase in the backlog, residential markets continue to be doing just extraordinarily, strong to the point, where I'd say, we're still needing to run after that market, we're still trying to fulfill this increasing backlog in that business. And so residential, we think continues to be extremely strong. You heard me talk about what's going on today in the data center market and some of the double-digit growth in the Americas, up 30% in global. And so, data center market is driven by this insatiable appetite that we all have for data continues to grow very strongly, utility markets continues to do well. There's been a lot written about what's happening today in commercial construction and that's the market that everybody is watching and we are as well. We think it's important to note, even there that if you think about, for Eaton specifically, commercial construction is under 20% of our total Electrical business in the Americas, of that some one-third of it goes into retrofit and upgrades, which tend to be more predictable. And then there are markets like warehousing, for example, that's in commercial construction, which has a much higher Electrical intensity than let's say retail, that's doing quite well. And so, I'd say that by and large, we're comfortable with the guidance that we provided for our Electrical businesses in the Americas and globally, 3% to 5% very much consistent with the trends that we saw during the course of Q4, assuming we don't have these supply-chain-related disruptions that we experience. And we're certainly encouraged by the fact that we built backlog. And as you know, the backlog for us typically ships in 12 months or less. So that gives us also lots of confidence in our ability to deliver those revenue numbers. Nicole DeBlase : Got it. That's very helpful color, Craig. And then for my follow up, can we just talk a little bit about unpacking the outlook for margins, what you guys have embedded for underlying decrementals relative to other puts and takes like temporary cost coming back, some of the restructuring payback that you'll start to see this year or maybe some M&A impact? If you could provide some color there? Craig Arnold : Yes. And I think the margins that we guided to 7.8% at the midpoint, an all-time record. Certainly, very much indicative of the fact that the incremental margins in 2021 are going to be quite attractive. Certainly, we're going to start to see some benefits associated with the $280 million restructuring program that we put in place, $200 million in mature year. While we start to see some of those benefits, clearly in '21. The other thing, with respect to, we did, like other companies take a number of temporary cost containment measures during the course of 2020. And I think, for the most part, we're expecting most of our costs to come back in 2021. The one place that we'll continue to see some benefits with respect to cost containment measures is, certainly, we're not spending nearly as much traveling, hotels, and so our travel and entertainment expenses will certainly continue to run at levels that are well below historical levels. But the other things that we've done during the course of 2020 to contain costs, we're assuming that all of those costs come back into the business during 2021. And so for the most part, I'd say, the plan is very well-conceived and thought through, and the margins that we've articulated for our businesses are very much consistent with where our businesses are currently running and simply adding to that these increments and decrements for cost-containment measures plus restructuring benefits. And so, we're comfortable with the number. Nicole DeBlase : Thanks, Craig. I'll pass it on. Craig Arnold : Great. Thank you. Operator : Next to the line of Andrew Obin of Bank of America. Your line is open. Andrew Obin : Yes, good morning. Craig Arnold : Hi, Andrew. Andrew Obin : First, I want to extend my congratulations and thanks to Rick, you probably don't remember it, but you and Sandy were at my first meeting at the Senior Analyst in London years and years ago. So, thank you, for all the help. Richard Fearon : You're welcome. I do remember that, Andrew. And you've been a loyal commentator over all these years. So, thank you. Andrew Obin : No, thanks. Maybe you can follow Sherlock Holmes and write a monograph on these or something before you get on to better and bigger things. But just a question, just a broader question, a lot of change in Eaton, if you look, there is new appointments, Katrina Redmond Rogers, the CTO. You have new head of energy transition. Can you just sort of talk about what should we think about this change and what is the signal about the direction of the company over the next couple of years? That's my first question. Craig Arnold : Yes, I'd say it's. I appreciate your commenting on the changes because we have like every company you go through a period of refreshment, and sometimes these are additions as you think about moving the strategic direction of the company in a particular direction or two, and sometimes people just simply time out like, Rick, has. And -- but certainly, if you think about some of the additions that we've made like to add Aravind Yarlagadda to our team and reports to me, and he is our Chief Digital Officer and that's really a reflection of the fact that I talk about these three big trends that are taking place. And I think, as I mentioned, perhaps the three biggest trends that we will see in our lifetimes around energy transition, connectivity, climate change and the like. So this is really positioning the organization to capitalize on these trends that we're seeing inside of our markets. And so I think these are changes that we're absolutely thrilled with, and we think we're bringing in people or having people step up to take on responsibilities that will ensure that Eaton takes our unfair share of these growth opportunities that we're looking at into the future. And so I do think it's -- if these changes are going to hope that you'd see that they are very much strategically aligned with where the company, said, that we want to go and these are things that are certainly going to help us capitalize on those opportunities. Andrew Obin : And just a follow-up question. We're getting a lot of questions, your e-Mobility business, and I know we're definitely still in the investment stage and will be for a while, but could you just comment in terms of who should we think as your customers because, clearly, a lot of activity in sort of electric vehicle space. Can you just talk you're targeting North American players, players in Asia, Europe, as this thing emerges 2, 3 years from now as a bigger business, who should we see as the key customer base there? Thank you. Craig Arnold : Yes. I appreciate the question on e-Mobility. And obviously, it's a very hot space and a lot going on there. And I'd say for us, it's not so much a focus on a geographic solution, as much as it is really a technology-driven solution. So we're really focusing on those areas around power electronics, power conversion, inverters, converters, power distribution, onboard charging. So for us, we were endeavoring to be a global player serving both the light vehicle market. I'd say, and importantly, by the way, the commercial vehicle market where we have a very strong footprint today with commercial vehicle customers. And so, I would think about it, really more we are endeavoring to play around the world and to be balanced, quite frankly, around the world, but it's really focusing on very particular technologies and products where we think, we can offer a unique solution and deliver acceptable returns for the company. Andrew Obin : I guess the question is, we know about your very strong position with existing players, with traditional OEMs. Just going back to your internal combustion engine days, but should we see it also taking our fair share with the emerging players as well? Craig Arnold : Yes, I think I'd say that. I'd say, even today, if you think about the emerging players. I mean, today we -- Tesla is a great example. Tesla is a customer today. And so I would say that absolutely, I mean whether it's an existing player as they work their way through this transition to electrification or it's some of the emerging players in the US around the world. I mean, you could think about us pursuing opportunities with all of them. Andrew Obin : Thank you very much. Craig Arnold : Thank you. Operator : Next, we have the line of Nigel Coe, Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Nigel Coe : Thanks. Good morning. Craig Arnold : Good morning, Nigel. Nigel Coe : So Rick, entering [indiscernible] is not bad. So, congratulations on a great career and we will miss you. Richard Fearon : Great. Thank you, Nigel. Nigel Coe : So, I just want to clarify on the guidance framework. Hydraulics is that is the one quarter, so I'm sorry if I missed that in prepared remarks, is that in for one quarter and if Hydraulics in your 1Q guide for organic and margins? Richard Fearon : Yes, it is. It is in for one quarter and it is included in the guidance for Q1. That's correct. Craig Arnold : And the market growth rate that we gave for Hydraulics that's the growth rate in Q1. Nigel Coe : Q1. Exactly right. Thanks. Thanks for the kind of clarification. And then moving on to Electrical Americas, and I fully absorbed the comments about COVID and supply chain, but it did come in slight below your plan for those reasons I guess, but just a little bit of context in terms of what happens during the quarter, in the Americas? And did we see channel destocking and the sequential kind of Q-to-Q on the margin in that segment was a bit heavier than what we'd expected. So a little bit of context there would be helpful? Craig Arnold : Yes, I'd say specifically as the quarter unfolded, I would say that, we in the US certainly experience second waves and additional kind of supply chain-related constraints in the Americas that certainly impacted the business. And I'd say, on a relative basis, the month of December and the end of the quarter was better than the beginning of the quarter, as some of the supply chain constraints began to be sorted somewhat. As you probably read and here, there are lots of issues in the various ports LA, Long Beach. And so it really has been a supply chain issue, it's been in some cases an issue around keeping our sites fully staffed on the manufacturing floor as absentee rates, whether it's for Eaton or some other suppliers have been a little bit of a challenge during the early part of the quarter. And so I'd say, no, the Americas business, specifically performing very much in line with what we would have anticipated. But for these disruptions, I'd say, in supply chain. And specifically, to your question around destocking, I'd say, no, I mean we didn't really see at this juncture, we think inventory levels in the channel, with the exception, as I noted in residential, we think the channel is largely where it should be given the outlook for revenue. And so I think we are quite frankly still have some channel stocking to do in the residential side of the business. But other than that it's pretty well aligned. Nigel Coe : Okay. I'll leave it there. Operator : Next to go to the line of Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research. Your line is open. Jeff Sprague : Thank you. Good day, everyone, and congrats Rick. I don't think this is your last earnings call, though. I think you're dialing in next quarter with us you'll make it 76, you're not going to let go that easily. Richard Fearon : You can bet on that, Jeff. Jeff Sprague : So just be on the beach with Margarita, I think. Hey, I just wanted to dig into Cobham a little if we could. Tripp Lite looks like a total slam dunk from my vantage point. There are some questions around Cobham that I'm hoping you could maybe address. The PE firm disclosed EBITDA, I think it was of GBP95 million in 2019. Right? So it's about $124 million. I think your acquisition multiple implies, it's running 210-ish. And I'm getting a fair amount of questions is there just some kind of accounting change their relative to Boeing program accounting? And if there is any particular disconnect actually in the EBIT in that business relative to how the cash flows might be running in the business? Richard Fearon : Jeff, I'll address that. If you looked at that unit, that unit had a lot of inter-company relationships with other parts of Cobham. And so you have to actually unpack that information and restate it to get to the standalone Cobham Mission Systems EBITDA. And so that's what we're referring to, the appropriate standalone Cobham Mission Systems EBITDA. Jeff Sprague : So there is not any extraordinary growth in between 2019 and 2021 on accounting changes or anything? Richard Fearon : No. Jeff Sprague : No. And how about the cash flow equation there? Richard Fearon : Well, it's -- we're not expecting to own it for much of '21. As we said at the start of Q4 is what we're building in as the close and so they'll be just a modest amount of cash flow. But next year, we would expect, you would have a full year's worth of quite good cash flow. EBITDA margins as a percentage of sales are quite good in that business. Jeff Sprague : And then... Craig Arnold : If I can just add, Jeff, I would just tell you that we are every bit as excited about Cobham Mission Systems as we are Tripp Lite. We think they're both highly strategic acquisitions. We think both of them do wonders for our business, and specific to Cobham Mission Systems, I think it's really -- it's all about what platforms are you on in the Aerospace business. And if you're on the right platforms at the right time, these businesses go on for a very long period of time. The typical military platform could run 40, 50 years and we're at the very front end of what's going to be a very long expansion cycle on the military side and Cobham has been very successful on some of the most important military platforms that are going to run for a very long period of time. So, we think it really adds a large level of continuity, and consistency and predictability to the company into our Aerospace business for some time to come. Richard Fearon : And Jeff, just to put some meat on what I said, the EBITDA margins are between 20% and 25%. So that's a very attractive business. Jeff Sprague : Could you also just comment on how you utilize that tax benefit? That's part of the deal? Richard Fearon : So that's simply a 338(h)(10) election. So all that means is that, that will give us a tax deduction for the asset value, and typically in a situation like this, you end up paying the seller for that because we are the ones that are going to be able to deduct that value. Jeff Sprague : I see. Thank you. Good luck with the deals. Thank you. Richard Fearon : Appreciate it. Operator : Next, we have the line of Scott Davis of Melius Research. Your line is open. Scott Davis : Hi, good morning, guys. Congrats, Rick. Richard Fearon : Thanks. Scott Davis : Hate to ask kind of minutia here, but what is the full amortization effect once these two big deals close? Richard Fearon : Well, here's the way to think about it, Scott. The gross accretion, are you talking about amortization or accretion? Scott Davis : Just amortization, not the accretion. Richard Fearon : Okay. You're going to have -- you've got $0.70 from -- that's the current Eaton amortization, and then I'll give you just in one second, I'll give you the... Craig Arnold : While, Rich, is looking that up, Scott, if you have a second question, we'll let Rick go through. Scott Davis : I do. If we go back to e-Mobility and I know the question was asked and kind of a different way, and I'm going to ask it again. I mean, do you expect the growth rate to match up with kind of the penetration of electric vehicles, I mean because I think, memory serves me right, I think the forecasts are something like 50% growth rates in EVs in 2021, but should it be a higher growth rate than the actuals we saw EVs because you have a higher content per vehicle that's going in or increasing content. I'm just kind of struggling to reconcile your conservative forecast with the actual growth that people are expecting? Craig Arnold : Yes. And I think so much of it, Scott, is going to be a function on which platform are you on and when does the platform that you're on gets launched into the marketplace. And so, a lot of the growth today in EVs and what's perhaps in some of the forecasts are based upon some existing platforms are heavily influenced by companies like Tesla. But the other thing, I would say is, if you think about our e-Mobility business, it's both in electrification of cars, but it's also the legacy business as well. And so it's really all of the electrical content that we have going into vehicles, in general, not just the high-voltage electrical solutions that you're seeing specifically on e-Mobility platforms. And so for what it's a -- for us it's what we have fairly good visibility too, things could turn out to be slightly different than that, but it's really a function of which platform that you're on. Craig Arnold : And Scott, to answer to your question on the intangible amortization for the full year of both of those deals is about 15%. Scott Davis : Okay. Okay, good. I'll pass on. Thank you, guys, and good luck. Craig Arnold : Thanks, Scott. Appreciate it. Operator : Next, we have the line of Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Joseph Ritchie : Thanks. Good morning, everybody. And I'll pass along might kudos and congratulation to you as well, Rick. Really enjoyed working with you throughout the years. Richard Fearon : Okay. Thanks, Joe. Joseph Ritchie : So maybe just starting off on the two acquisitions. Can you guys maybe just provide a little bit more history that you have with the company -- with both of those companies? How long they've been on your radar screen? And then also specifically, anything you can tell us about how those companies performed through the pandemic? Craig Arnold : Yes. I'd say that, for us, Joe, we're always actively quoting companies, and strategically if you think about today the way these two companies fit into our broader portfolio, you can imagine that they've been on our list for some time. And we always find that when you create long-term relationships and you're working with companies and the management team early on in the process, it increases your likelihood of success. And as a result, we're absolutely thrilled to be of a -- to add these two companies to our portfolio. And so suffice it to say that we've been at it with these companies for some time. Obviously, these transactions come together fairly quickly, but a lot of quoting had taken place long before these deals were finally signed overall. And then in terms of performance; I mean, both of these businesses performed extremely well through the pandemic. As you saw, or you will likely see the Cobham because it's a military business, they actually, despite the fact that we went through this pandemic, their military business just like our military business held up very well, and that's one of the good attributes of having military business is in general. They tend to be much more consistent, much more predictable than perhaps some of the more commercial endeavors. And the same thing I would say would be true of Tripp Lite, while the revenues regressed a little bit during the course of 2020, it held up much better than most other business is largely because of the segment of the market that it serving, in essentially, enterprise, data solutions, computing at the edge, they are exposed, obviously, to this growth in 5G. And so, both of these businesses, I would say, held up better than the underlying markets. Joseph Ritchie : Yes. That's helpful, Craig. I guess maybe just following up on a question from earlier on the cash flow of these two businesses. And so I fully recognize it's not going to have much of an impact in 2021, but if you take a look at your EBITDA -- implied EBITDA in the out years on the menial basis, it's about $365 million to $370 million. I guess just in that context, how should we think about whether it's an absolute dollar amount, free cash flow margins or free cash flow conversion for the two businesses that are coming out? Richard Fearon : I mean, I believe, from a cash conversion basis, you'll see that it will be very high for these two businesses because they will have a fair amount of intangible amortization. And obviously, that's non-cash amortization, and their underlying EBITDA margins are quite strong. And so they should actually be additive to our overall free cash flow margins. Joseph Ritchie : Okay, I'll leave it there. Thank you, guys. Operator : Next, we go to the line of Ann Duignan of JP Morgan. Your line is open. Ann Duignan : Hi. Good morning, everybody. And Rick. I think I see you more likely playing golf in Ireland and sitting on a beach, but however, hopefully both. Craig Arnold : You know him well. Ann Duignan : Anyway, I guess, Rick, my question of you is on the Tripp Lite acquisition single phase, for a long time you had said that single phase was not a very attractive end market. It was lower margin, more commodity-type business. What's changed and what's different about Tripp Lite that makes you think that this is different this time? Richard Fearon : I don't know where you got the impression that that single phase is lower margin. In fact, it's never been lower margin. It actually has margins that are every bit as good as three-phase. And the market actually if you look at the entire power quality market, the market splits out historically about half three-phase and half single-phase, and we of course, are already a significant participant in a single-phase market. Not as much in the US as we are in EMEA, and APAC and so this simply gives us a complete global footprint for the single-phase business. And you know we -- the single-phase business is one that we built up over, really the last 10 years through several acquisitions starting with MGE, which we did in '07, and Phoenixtec, which we did in '08. And so we've been -- we're very knowledgeable acquirer in this space and so this was an opportunity to add a fill-in for us, company that gave us the Americas exposure that we hadn't gotten through those other acquisitions. And it's a very high margin space. It has been, ever since we participated in it. Ann Duignan : Okay, I'm going back even earlier than that. So, maybe I'm taking back too far my memory, and so apologize for that. Maybe you could give us a little bit more color like you did on Electrical Americas, maybe you could talk about the Electrical Global and what you saw there through the course of the fourth quarter and any supply chain issues? And you mentioned supply chain issues in the context of Electrical Americas, but what about copper prices, are you concerned about input costs as you go through 2021? Thanks. Craig Arnold : Yes. I appreciate that question, Ann. And I'd say very much like we experienced in the US, I'd say, our Electrical Global business while it did better than what we anticipated. You find many of the same trends where you know, I'd say that residential markets, utility markets, data centers continued to be very strong. The one headwind we have that in Electrical Global, as you know we report our oil and gas exposure through Crouse-Hinds in our Electrical Global business, and the oil and gas markets continued to be weak. And so that's perhaps holding that business back a little bit, but with respect to supply chain, yes, we are absolutely seeing it. We're seeing inflationary pressures in copper, we're seeing it in some steel, we're seeing some availability, even some pressures also in microprocessors like around the company. And the way I would think about that once again, is that we've seen this stuff starting to kind of raise its head back in the fourth quarter. Our teams have been very busy putting together mitigation plans, largely, around things that we can do to either chain sourcing or to taking our prices up in the marketplace. And while there could always be a quarter or so timing impact we're confident that we'll be able to offset any inflation that we see in the business with either cost reduction measures or through pricing in the marketplace. But be up -- but there's no question, what you're seeing and hearing about copper and some of the other commodities is absolutely consistent with what we're seeing, which is maybe, on the other hand, an indication also that markets are strengthening. So the other side of that equation, if you typically see these commodity increases when the market is inflecting positively. Ann Duignan : Fair point, I'll get back in line. I appreciate it. Thanks. Good luck, Craig. Craig Arnold : Thanks. Operator : Next, we have the line of David Raso, Evercore ISI. Your line is open. David Raso : Hi, thank you and congratulations, Rick. I have two calculations, I was hoping you can sanity check, and then a quick follow-up. At the end of '21 after all the businesses that are sold, acquired on a pro forma basis is the net debt to EBITDA for the company is about -- I'd say about 2.5 times? And then on value accretion --I'm sorry if you can please answer that one first. Richard Fearon : Well, yes. Yes, certainly, it has gone up with EBITDA having come down somewhat in 2020. But when you're looking at 2021 EBITDA, it's hard to do that on the back of an envelope but it sounds roughly correct. David Raso : Yes, I tried to run it out through year-end and basically looked at it on pro forma Hydraulics out for all year '21 added the other deals and so forth and to repo and dividend. So, okay. In the second call, the accretion from the deals, on the first full year of ownership, not '21, full year of ownership the accretion on coming up with his sort of $0.50 to $0.60 EPS is that sort of where we should be thinking? Thank you. Richard Fearon : It is probably -- the way to think about it, Dave, is it's probably around -- if you just look at the gross accretion and you don't factor in that the money that we're using to buy this we would have used for repurchases or whatever. But if you look at the gross accretion, it's probably around $0.70, and one way to think about it as you get $0.25 in 2021 and you'll get another $0.45 in 2022. David Raso : And that's before taking swag 2% lost opportunity for interest income or debt -- short-term debt for the -- on the $4.5 billion? Richard Fearon : Yes. I'm just looking at the gross for that. David Raso : Okay. So, it's about $0.50 to $0.60. Okay. And then after that these -- I mean, obviously you've been very active, I mean the last few days alone, but after these moves, should we think of the company in more digestion mode through the end of '22 as a base case? Craig Arnold : Yes, I'd say that, you know what, we've always found to be the case is that deals are opportunistic in the sense that you never know when you're going to get an opportunity to buy a company that is the right strategic fit, that's the right multiple. And I'd say that from a capacity standpoint, we have capacity to do more. Our team certainly has an appetite to do more and we continue to be active in and having other conversations. And so I'd say you can expect us to continue to be opportunistic. I mean the good news about these acquisitions while they are material in size in terms of the impact on the company they are relatively well contained in terms of which piece of the company will have the responsibility for integrating, so you could expect that the Aerospace team will be busy, obviously, integrating Cobham. And so you could probably expect nothing material, in addition, to Cobham in Aerospace, but the company is large and we have other businesses today where they have plenty of capacity to do things to integrate acquisitions. If we can find the right company that is the right strategic fit at the right price. David Raso : All right, terrific. Thank you. Operator : Next, we have the line of John Inch of Gordon Haskett. Your line is open. John Inch : Yes, thank you. Good morning still, everyone. Rick, we're all jealous so congratulations. Richard Fearon : Thank you. John Inch : You are welcome. Hey, I want to pick up on the end guidance theme about the Rolls, Craig. How much visibility do you have, including say risk towards your project backlog and say margins profile. And considering obviously the variety of raw inputs and cost increasing, how flexible is that? Are there clauses in it? Just any more color would be helpful. Craig Arnold : Yes. No, I appreciate the question because we obviously are carrying a very large backlog in our Electrical businesses, both in the Americas and globally. And I'd like -- what I would tell you about the backlog in general that -- and as it relates to sort of the guidance that we provided is that we've factored, all of that in. And so, we understand what we have in the backlog, we understand the type of commodity inflation we're likely to experience this year based upon the run-up in commodities steel, copper and others. And based upon that, we've come up with our kind of the outlook for the year. But I would say that it's a bit of a mixed bag. In some cases, we're able to reprice things that are in the backlog, based upon the agreements in the customers and basket of commodities and the like. In other cases, we cannot. But I think the important message for everyone to kind of appreciate is that all of that has been factored in to the guidance that we provided for the year. John Inch : No, it's -- are you raising prices now, by the way, whether it'd be projects or other items and anticipation of the raws. I know you said it things lag kind of a quarter or two. At what point you have to say we got to raise prices versus sort of seeing if these moves are temporary? And I agree with you, I think it is the result of increasing -- it's a signal increasing improving demand and improving economy. Craig Arnold : Yes. No, I'd say that I can tell you today that we have planning going on, in some cases actions being taken across the company. And it will vary by customer, by market, by business, but the simple answer is there is either planning or activity taking place right now where we've seen and experienced inflation, quite frankly, not just on the commodity side, but also in transportation and logistics. John Inch : Yes, makes sense. And just as a follow-up. Tom, I think one of the items that within his background that was flagged was perhaps his experience with respect to distribution and maybe the opportunities to help Eaton, further build out its distribution network and growth opportunities outside of the US. I'm wondering if you guys could maybe expand upon what you see as this opportunity? And is this sort of a long-term vision or are there actual things you could actually be sort of working on in the near-term? Craig Arnold : Yes. What I'd add to that is, and as you know we, most of our company goes to market through distribution and it's -- I'd say, if you think about all of the core assets that Eaton has as an organization our distributors and the relationship that we have with distributors is probably one of our greatest assets. And I think everybody is also well aware of the fact that the nature of distribution is changing. And as we think about, Tom, and what you can bring to the organization based upon his experience at places like Amazon, helping us think through the nature of distribution and helping our distributors, quite frankly, think through changes that they need to make within their businesses to deliver different kinds of experiences to their customers is where we would expect that Tom will put his fingerprints on the company. And, we remain committed to distribution, we think it's a big part of our future. We'd like to do more through our existing distributors. And so we're just very hopeful and expect that Tom will bring some unique insights there. John Inch : Thanks, Craig. Good luck, Rick. Richard Fearon : Thanks. Yan Jin : Thank you all. I think we're reaching the end of our call. We do appreciate everybody's question. As always, Chip and I will be available to answer any follow-up questions. Thank you for joining us today, and have a great day. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the presentation for this morning. Again, we thank you very much for all of your participation and using AT&T's Teleconferencing Services. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode and later we'll conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. And I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Eaton's Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Yan Jin. Please go ahead. Yan Jin : Good morning, guys. Thank you all for joining us for Eaton first quarter 2021 earnings call. With me today are Craig Arnold, our Chairman and CEO; and Tom Okray, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our agenda today, including opening remarks by Craig highlighting the Company's performance in the first quarter. As we have done on our past calls, we'll be taking questions at end of Craig's comments. The press release and the presentation we'll go through today have been posted on our website at www.eaton.com. This presentation, including adjusted earnings per share, adjusted free cash flow and other non-GAAP measures that are reconciled in the appendix. A webcast of this call is accessible on our website and will be available for replay. I would like to remind you that our comments today will include statements related to the expected future results of the Company and are therefore forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our forecasted projection due to a wide range of the risk and uncertainty as described in our earnings release and presentation. With that, I will turn it over to Craig. Craig Arnold : Thanks, Yan. Appreciate it. We'll start on Page 3 with recent highlights. And first, I'd just say we had a terrific quarter, and we're significantly increasing our full year guidance, as you saw. Our teams have just done an outstanding job of managing through this dynamic market environment, which is reflected in our strong results. Q1 adjusted earnings per share of $1.44 were a solid 15% increased year-over-year and 18% above the midpoint of our guidance. Our Q1 revenues of $4.7 billion were up 0.5% organically, which was well above the high end of our guidance range of down 3%. This outperformance was driven primarily by the two electrical segments as well as our Vehicle business. We also posted a Q1 record for segment margins of 17.7%. And looking at our incrementals, we generated $73 million of higher profits despite having $97 million of lower revenues. This was the result of, we'd say, strong execution, ongoing improvements in the cost structure from the multiyear restructuring program that we announced in the second quarter of 2020 as well as closely managing price and inflation in the quarter. Our cash flow was also very strong. Adjusted operating cash flow increased by 42%, and our adjusted free cash flow increased by 62%, and we have another successful quarter of M&A closing three deals. We're also making good progress towards the closure of the previously announced acquisition of Cobham Mission Systems as well as the divestiture of Hydraulics. And finally, we recently announced the agreement to acquire 50% of Jiangsu YiNeng Electric bus way business in China, an important part of our growth strategy for the Asia Pacific region. Having been quite busy on the M&A front, we thought it would be helpful to provide a summary of these three recent deals. We covered trip light and Cobham Mission Systems acquisitions in some depth on the investor meetings. But each of these three deals here certainly advanced our strategic growth objectives in our electrical business. First, Green Motion based in Switzerland. It expands our capabilities in the electrical charging market, where we expect to see significant growth over the next decade linked to energy transition. Their proven charger designs and advanced power management capabilities and building software are valuable additions to our existing energy storage and power distribution offerings that support our view of everything as a grid. We also closed our previously announced investment in Hanyu. Hanyu is based in China and provides a strong portfolio of products that will open up significant growth opportunities in our business throughout Asia Pacific. They make cost-effective circuit breakers and contactors and that give us access to Tier 2 and Tier 3 markets in Asia Pacific. And finally, last week, we're pleased to announce the agreement to acquire 50% of Jiangsu YiNeng Electric bus way business in China. YiNeng's strong bus way capabilities in China, combined with Eaton's broad portfolio of products, will really position us well to participate in the high-growth data center, industrial and high-end commercial segments, and allowing us to pull-through related electrical products. The Hunyu and YiNeng transactions, I'd also add, significantly expand our addressable market in China and in Asia Pacific, certainly allowing us to accelerate our growth rate in the region. Moving to Page 5. We summarize our Q1 financial results, and I'll just note a couple of points here. First, acquisitions increased sales by 1%, but this was more than offset by the divestiture of Lighting, which reduced sales by 5.5%. And you'll recall that we sold the Lighting business in March of 2020. And second, segment margins of $831 million were 10% above prior year, and this is despite a 2% decline in total revenue. This is largely the result that, I'd say, of solid execution, restructuring savings and really our ability to effectively manage price and inflation during the quarter. We expect the inflation impact to worsen, certainly in Q2, but we will full -- more than fully offset this for the full year. And lastly, our adjusted earnings of $577 million, up 12% and when combined with our lower share count, we delivered a 15% increase in our adjusted EPS. Turning to Page 6. You see the results for our Electrical Americas segment. Revenues were up 2% organically, driven by strength in data centers, residential and utility markets, which offset weakness in industrial and commercial markets. The acquisition of Tripp Lite and PDI added 2% of revenues, while the divestiture of lighting reduced revenues by 14%. We're very pleased to also have closed the Tripp Lite acquisition sooner than planned and to welcome their team to the Eaton family. Operating margins, as you can see, increased sharply, up 330 basis points to 20.5%, a quarterly record. And as you can see, profits were $24 million higher on significantly lower revenues. These results, once again, were driven by good execution, cost savings and really favorable mix due to the divestiture of lighting. We're also pleased with the 11% orders growth in the quarter. This was driven by once again strength in data center and residential markets. Our backlog was actually up 23% versus last year and due to ongoing strength in, once again, data center and residential markets. We are also encouraged to see some very large orders in select commercial markets perhaps a sign here that these markets too, are beginning to turn positive. And while it's difficult to judge, we do think the order strength could have been due to some concern about some of the supply chain shortages that you certainly have been reading about. Next, on Page 7. We show the results for our Electrical Global segment. We posted a 5% organic growth with 5% favorable impact from currency, largely due to the weaker; dollar. Organic revenue growth was driven by strength in data centers, residential and utility markets. You can see the pattern here. We also delivered 250 basis points increase in operating margins and posted a new Q1 record of 17%. Our incremental margins in the segment were also strong, more than 40% and and we're also driven by good cost control measures, saving from actions taken from our multiyear restructuring program. Orders grew 7% in the quarter, and like sales, the primary contributors to the growth came from data centers, residential and utility markets. I'd say dragged down by the earlier COVID-related declines, orders declined 12% -- excuse me, 5% on a rolling 12-month basis. And lastly, here, our backlog was up 17% versus last year, driven by the same three end markets. Moving to Page 8. We summarize our Hydraulics segment. Revenues increased 11%, with strong 9% organic growth and 2% positive currency impact. Operating margin stepped up significantly to 15%, a 420 basis point improvement over last year. And our Q1 orders were also very strong, up 53%, driven primarily by strength in mobile equipment markets. As we anticipated, Danfoss did receive conditional regulatory approval from the EU to acquired Hydraulics business, which is an important step in the process, and this sale is still expected to close in the second quarter here. Turning to Page 9. We have the financial results for our Aerospace segment. Revenues were down 24%, including 26% organic decline, driven by the continued downturn in commercial aviation. Currency, as you can see, added 2% to revenues. And as you can also see, operating margins were down 310 basis points to 18.5%, down but still at very attractive levels overall. Our team, I give them a lot of credit. They moved quickly to flex the business and were able to really deliver better than normal decremental margins of approximately 30%. Orders were down 36% on a rolling 12-month basis, once again, due to the ongoing downturn in commercial aerospace markets. Now however, I would add, on a sequential basis, we are starting to see some improvement as orders were up 14% from Q4. And lastly, our previously announced acquisition of Cobham Mission Systems remains on track, and we expect the transaction to close at the beginning of Q4 2021. Next, on Page 10, we show the results of our Vehicle segment. As you can see, revenues increased 9% and were much stronger than anticipated. The strongest growth came from global commercial vehicle markets and from the Chinese light vehicle market. This as a point of reference here, NAFTA Class 8 production was up some 12%. Operating margins also improved significantly here to 17.3%, another quarterly record and a 380 basis point increase with incremental margins of nearly 60%. The strong margin performance was driven certainly by increased volume and also from savings from the multiyear restructuring program that we've undertaken. And despite volumes that were still below pre pandemic levels, this business is approaching our target segment margins of 18%, so making very strong progress in our vehicle segment. And one additional noteworthy development in this segment was the introduction of the new automated transmission for the heavy-duty truck market in China through our Eaton Cummins JV. This product, I'd say, is already getting great traction and seeing strong growth in the market. Turning to Page 11. We summarize our e-mobility segment. Here, revenues increased 15%: 13% organic and 2% from currency. We experienced solid growth in global vehicle markets, which was driven here both by high and low-voltage products. Operating margins were a negative 8.4% as we continue to invest heavily in R&D. And as I've reported in the past, we continue to manage just a really robust pipeline of opportunities. Of note in Q1, we secured a multiyear agreement with a leading global automotive customer to buy our next-generation break door circuit protection technology for battery electric vehicles. This award represents $33 million in material revenue sales, and we hope to be awarded additional vehicle platforms using the same technology. And this win, I would say, it really does highlight the strength of our electrical pedigree and how we're able to leverage this strength to grow in the e-mobility markets. And on Slide 12, we've updated our organic revenue guidance for the year. As you can see, we're significantly increasing our organic revenue growth for the year with our strong Q1 results. We're optimistic about the remainder of 2021. Our strong order book and growing backlog basis that markets and market demand is really increasing and improving across most of our end markets. We now expect overall Eaton organic growth to be up 7% to 9%, and this is up from 4% to 6% previously. And while we're experiencing some supply chain issues, we have confidence in our team's ability to manage through these temporary challenges. As you can see, we've kept our forecast for aerospace unchanged. Vehicle has increased by 600 basis points. Electrical Globals increased by 400 basis points and all other segments have increased by 300 basis points. Encouragingly, I'd say here about our Electrical segment, we're seeing higher-than-expected demand across all of our markets with the exception of utility, and that market remains in line with our original outlook, which was for mid-single-digit growth, a really strong performance in the electrical segments. Moving to Page 13. We show our updated segment margin guidance for the year, where we're also significantly increasing our guidance. For Eaton overall, we're increasing segment margins by 50 basis points at the midpoint with a range of 17.8% to 18.3%. And we've raised our margin guidance in each of our segments with the exception of Aerospace and e-mobility, which are unchanged. Compared with our original guidance, we expect to deliver better incremental margins for sure on this higher volume. I'd also note that for the full year, we continue to expect net price versus inflation to be neutral. And on Page 14, we have the balance of our 2021 guidance. We're raising our full year adjusted EPS by $0.50 to $5.90 to $6.30, a midpoint of $6.10. And this is a 9% increase over our prior guidance and a 24% increase over 2020. With our recent M&A activities, we now expect a net 4% headwind from acquisitions and divestitures, down from our prior outlook of 8%. I say it's also worth noting here that our segment margin guidance of 18.1% to 18.5% is 190 basis points increase at the midpoint over 2020 and will be an all-time record. It's also -- this is a point of reference, above our pre pandemic margins of 17.6%, which we posted in 2019, which was also an all-time record. So we're off to a strong start, and I'd say, well on our way to achieve our longer-term targets of getting to 21% segment margins. The remaining components of our full year 2021 guidance remain unchanged. And lastly, for Q2, our guidance is as follows. We expect to be between $1.45 and $1.55 on earnings, for organic revenue to be up 24% to 28% and for segment margins to come in between 17.5% and 17.9%. And if I could, just finally, on Page 15, I'll wrap up with a kind of a high-level summary of why we think Eaton remains an attractive long-term investment. And I begin with first, our intelligent power management strategy really does position us to capitalize on these key secular growth trends that we've talked about for the last couple of years : electrification, energy transition and digitalization. And we're gaining traction here. In all of these areas, we put a number of new wins. Our technology solutions, including our Brightlayer platform are being well received by customers. And as a result, we continue to expect higher-than-historical organic growth rates for the Company. And over the next five years, we're reaffirming our view that 4% to 6% outlook looks very much in hand. Now this accelerated growth plus our, what I call, proven ability to deliver margin expansion will allow us to deliver on average 11% to 13% EPS growth per year over the next five years. We'll also continue to deliver very strong free cash flow, which provides the optionality to invest in organic growth, to add strategic acquisitions and to return cash to shareholders. And our commitment to ESG remains strong. We'll continue to develop sustainable solutions for our customers, for our own businesses and certainly for the environment that we all share. So with that, I'd like to turn it back to Yan. Obviously, we're very pleased with a really strong start to the year and looking forward to answering your questions. Yan Jin : Thanks, Craig. [Operator Instructions] I appreciate that if you can just limit your opportunity to just one question and one follow-up. And with that, I will turn it over to the operator to give you guys the instruction. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is going to come from the line of Nicole Deblase with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Nicole DeBlase : Maybe we could just start with a clarification question, getting a lot of inbounds from investors about this. So when we look at the guidance today relative to where you were a few months ago, what's been added in with respect to Hydraulics into the second quarter? And then the incremental earnings associated with Tripp Lite closing early? Craig Arnold : Yes. I appreciate the question, Nicole. It's obviously been a very busy quarter with a number of, I call it, positive moving pieces. So our current assumption in Hydraulics is that it would close here in the second quarter. And so you could think about a couple of months at about $0.05 a month for Hydraulics. And then specifically, as it relates to Tripp Lite, we were -- you could add about $0.10 or so for -- excuse me, about $0.07 for Tripp Lite. And then there's a couple of cents negative associated with the acquisition of Green Motion. So about $0.15 or so between the M&A activity. Nicole DeBlase : Okay. Got it, Craig. That's really clear. And then maybe you could talk a little bit about price cost. So I know you said neutral for the full year. But as we think about the phasing of margins throughout the year, are there certain quarters where you will be facing more of a price cost headwind? And so we should be factoring that into our segment margin assumption? Craig Arnold : Yes. No, certainly appreciate that question as well, and it's obviously one of the bigger topics that we're dealing with internally. And I think you're dealing with in terms of trying to model our results and others. And I'd say that what we experienced in Q1, I'd say, is largely, we were able to offset a lot of this commodity inflation that we had been experiencing through hedges and working out of inventory and other agreements. And so the biggest impact for us will be in Q2. And it's one of the reasons why you look at our Q2 guidance, and you say it may be a little muted given the very strong Q1. But that really is the quarter where we expect to see the biggest impact of material cost inflation. We're obviously getting price in the marketplace. It does take us typically a quarter or two to fully get pricing seeded into the marketplace. And so certainly, Q2 will be the most challenging quarter. It's certainly factored into our guidance that we've laid out, and it will get better from that point forward. So Q3 and Q4 will be certainly better on an incremental basis than Q2 will be. Fully offsetting it for the year, I would add as well, it's sometimes in hyperinflationary environment, it's tough to get a full incremental margin on material cost inflation will certainly more than offset it. But certainly, if you think about in hyperinflationary environment, you generally don't get a full incremental margin on inflation. Operator : We'll go next to the line of Andrew Obin of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Andrew Obin : Just a question. You guys did these deals in China, and you don't see a lot of companies in the U.S. being a being physically able to sort of find things to do in China and be sort of executed on them. Can you just give us a bit more background as to how these deals came around and also very intriguing opportunity that you're able to do more deals like that in China? Craig Arnold : Yes. Thanks for the question as well. And we are absolutely thrilled with what our local team has been able to do in the China market, and I would, in fact, put the emphasis on our local team. And our local team having been in the market for a number of years, building strong relationships with some of the electrical companies in the region, we're able to pull off some really attractive deals and I think a lot of that is attributed to the fact that we're willing to partner. These are JVs that we have 50% of. We won't consolidate the revenue. At least in China, we'll leverage their products and their low-cost footprint and we will consolidate revenues as we grow these businesses outside of China. But I say it's a combination of our local team's connectivity to the market. And Eaton's willingness and proven track record of really being a very successful JV partner. As you know, we have a number of JVs inside of our company in China, in our aerospace business in China. And I think we have a very strong reputation in the country around a company that can very effectively -- you can very effectively partner with. And at the same time, do things that are helpful to both our company and to the companies that we're partnering with. And so we're thrilled with it. I would add that to your other question, we are, in fact, having a number of other conversations around other similar types of transactions. Nothing to announce here today, but we're hopeful that we will continue to build on kind of this pattern of filling product gaps and whether that's a gap because it's a technology that we don't have like the bus way products in the China market or it's a product gap in the form of the ability to really compete in the local market because you have a low cost product. We see other opportunities to do very similar things in other parts of the portfolio. Andrew Obin : Fascinating. And then just a question on data centers. Can you just give us color on how much visibility do you have in hyperscale enterprise and maybe by region, it's just -- it's been such a hot market and such a big driver of growth for you guys? Just -- do you have one quarter visibility, six months a year? Just maybe a bit more of a deep dive here. Craig Arnold : Yes. I mean -- and certainly, the data center market has been one of the hottest markets in the electrical space, and we see that market growing by low double digits. And so it's a very strong market. And we think it will be a very strong market for a very long time. And we get back to this whole idea of saying, to the extent that you believe that the world will continue to generate, consume, process and store increasing amounts of data. The data center market will continue to be a very attractive market to be in for a very long time. And in terms of visibility, specifically in hyperscale, we're typically in the 6 to 12 months out window in terms of having fairly good visibility. As we've said, historically, hyperscale specifically tend to be a relatively lumpy market. And so orders come sometimes in big slugs in one quarter or one year versus the others as they reconfigure their data centers. But certainly, when you look at the market more broadly, we are just drilled by our position in this market and by the prospects to continue to grow here. Operator : We'll go next to the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Nigel Coe : So I wanted to get into Electrical Americas a little bit deeper. Obviously, very impressive margin leverage there. You called out residential and data center as particularly strong markets. Is there any mix impact here, Craig? We're used to industrial being margin accretive, maybe commercial being dilutive. But how does residential and data center impact margin mix? Craig Arnold : Yes. I'd say, if anything, to your point, Nigel, I think you know the business well that we tend to make higher margins on a relative basis in the industrial side of the business and the more commercially oriented stuff tends to be lower margin. And so we certainly have not experienced any positive mix in the Electrical Americas business. I think this margin that you're seeing in us posting these record levels of margins is really a function of the things that we talked about, which is our teams are executing well. We're certainly benefiting from some restructuring that we've done as a company, and the volume is obviously helping. And the big one is, obviously, if you think about electrical Americas, we divested the Lighting business. And as we continue to work the portfolio in what we call growth ahead and shrink to tail, we continue to do things inside of the Company to ensure that we're serving attractive markets. But no, we would expect that there's more room to grow, and when we think about margin expansion in our Electrical Americas segment, and certainly, as the industrial markets come back, that's going to certainly be accretive to margins. Nigel Coe : Right. Okay. Great. And then on the end markets, you basically said that all of them were going higher with the exception of utility, which remains in the mid single-digit range. And you called out strength in Global, not U.S. So I'm just wondering what we're seeing in the U.S. utility space. Are we seeing maybe slightly softer trends in the first half of the year? Any color there would be helpful. Craig Arnold : I mean the utility markets, for us, I say, are largely performing in line with what we originally said. We knew as we started the year, the utility markets would be a relatively strong market at mid-single-digit growth. And the market is just really continuing to perform in line with those numbers. And so really, the distinction, I'd say between the commentary around global versus the U.S. is really a function of change versus our original expectation. And so we have utility markets continue to be a very attractive space. We think with the work that we've talked about and the things that are going on around energy transition, hardening of the grid, grid resilience, we're seeing a lot of good activity. If you look at our broader negotiations in our Electrical business, they were up quite significantly from the fourth quarter. And so yes, this is a market that we continue to be optimistic about and we think the utility segment, very much different than its history is really going to be one of the important growth vectors for the Company as we look forward. Operator : We'll go next to the line of Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research. Please go ahead. Jeff Sprague : Craig, maybe just to pick up a little bit on that discussion about industrial. Are you actually seeing anywhere in your business, kind of early signs of some of those later cycle elements of your business are beginning to pick up? Perhaps it hasn't materialized in orders yet, but just kind of what you're hearing from your customers and the channel would be interesting. Craig Arnold : Yes. It's obviously too early, Jeff, to declare victory on any of this stuff, but we are certainly seeing some early signs in the industrial markets of things starting to to come back. And as I mentioned, negotiations for it, as you know, in our business, it's -- you have a pipeline, you do negotiations and you end up with a booking and ultimately a sale. And so we track negotiations in our business and they are up quite significantly from the fourth quarter and most of that increase, I'd say the biggest part of that increase in what we call our negotiations is coming from our industrial businesses. And so we're certainly seeing some green shoots there. You see a lot of discussion about this whole trend towards reshoring. And you certainly see that today in the semiconductor market, for example, where a number of very large semiconductor companies have announced very sizable projects here in the U.S., and those are very big industrial projects. And so yes, we're clearly seeing some early signs, too early to, let's say, once again, to clear that we know exactly where we're headed here, but certainly encouraging. Jeff Sprague : And secondly, unrelated, but just back to what you're doing here on M&A. Maybe just a little more on Green Motion. It sounded like that was a really interesting partner at your Analyst Day. You chose, obviously, to just kind of take them out in entirety what was the thought process there? And it sounds like maybe there's no revenues, but you feel like you have -- or very little, but you have some revenue visibility out into 23 and 24. Craig Arnold : Yes. I mean, Green Motion is a company that started back in 2009, so it's a relatively new organization as everything in and around kind of electrification of vehicles is new and so they are -- some revenues, but revenues are relatively modest at this point. As I mentioned, dilutive to margins as we continue to invest in this business, but yet, strategically, I mean it's just a perfect fit for us. And we see, Uday, and his team spend a lot of time talking about energy transition and what it's going to mean in terms of opportunities with respect to the grid as electric vehicles continue to grow. And they have both the hardware and the software technology and the billing systems to allow us to really participate in this really fast-growing and exciting space. And so today, they have a solution that works perfectly in the Nordic countries and most of Europe. We'll be taking that technology and integrating it with what we're currently doing in North America. So that we have a solution for the North American market as well. And so it's really an important part of our strategy and it really accelerates what we would have done organically inside of our company by acquiring this company. This gives us, I'd say, at least a couple of year head start for what we were planning to do organically. I think if you think about it in terms of our longer-term goals of where we said we'd be by 2030, probably doesn't change that materially because we planned on making these investments organically. So -- but it certainly accelerates our progress. Operator : We'll go next to the line of Scott Davis with Melius Research. Please go ahead. Scott Davis : Good morning. A lot of good stuff talked about so far. But if we backed up a little bit, Craig, and just talk through the supply chain issues. Your company, your business mix is a little bit different than kind of our average. How would you rank the supply chain issues? Is it more around -- is it more about higher raw material costs? Is it more about freight? I mean, how do you you guys think about it? And how are you managing it? Craig Arnold : And I'd say, it's probably fair to say, Scott, we're dealing with all of those challenges. We're dealing with certainly -- if you look at the basket of commodities that we buy, whether that's copper, aluminum, sheet steel, we're probably seeing today levels of inflation in those key raw materials that probably are at levels that we have not seen since probably 2010, 2011. And so clearly, commodity cost increase is on our key. Input material is quite a significant challenge. As you mentioned freight around the world and is up dramatically as well. And then with these challenges, obviously, you're dealing with the intermittent availability issues on things like you reading the newspaper with respect to semiconductors, which is impacting our vehicle business and also, to a certain extent, is impacting our electrical business. And so I think we're dealing with this entire kind of portfolio of challenges right now in the market, and our teams are managing through it extraordinarily well. And I would tell you that the good news in all of this is a great indicator of just how strong the market is. And so the other side of dealing with these challenges around inflation and freight and the like is that something very positive must be going on in your end markets, and that's really what we're experiencing. And as you know, getting price as a company is something that we do. It's certainly easier. In certain cases, distribution, for example, as long as the market moves, price is a good thing for distribution. And so today, I would tell you that we're dealing with each of these challenges, and there'll be certainly intermittent hiccups that we'll see in a business or any product line or in a quarter. But by and large, our teams are managing it well, and we'd expect things to start to to improve beginning in Q3. And by the time you get to Q4, perhaps at the end of the year for a lot of the bigger issues to be behind us. But we're managing through all of these challenges, but we've been here before. This is nothing new for our company. We've dealt with inflation before. We've dealt with these intermittent supply chain issues before, and I'm confident that we'll manage through this one extremely well as well. Scott Davis : That's helpful, Craig. And just -- I think this is part of Jeff's question, but you mentioned the semiconductor fabs and kind of this onshoring thing, but I always think of the rule of thumb, new factories, kind of 10% of it is going to be electrical content. How do you guys think about a semiconductor fab? I've actually never been in one. So is it is it heavier electrical content than an average kind of widget factory? Is it lighter, perhaps some -- clearly would be... Craig Arnold : The energy requirements of a semiconductor facility would tend to be higher than your typical commercial project, for example. And so the electrical intensity of that kind of project would be much, much higher. One of the other markets that we didn't talk about as well is water wastewater. That's another one of these markets. I would tell you where that we're starting to see growth in projects with another market that once again has higher electrical intensity in some of the other products on the industrial side. Operator : We'll go next to the line of John Inch of Gordon Haskett. Please go ahead. John Inch : Hey, Craig, is aerospace right-sized for a pending commercial flight rebound over the next couple of years, likely on a lagging shop visit after market basis but still a rebound nonetheless? Or would you actually have to begin to rehire? Craig Arnold : And I appreciate that question, John. It's a little different one that we're getting around aerospace these days, but certainly appreciate it. And I would tell you that one of the things that we've done is we've lived through cyclical businesses and have a lot of experience side of our company around how do you manage these businesses that go through from periods of time, these pretty big cyclical swings, and so I would tell you that our business is sized appropriately and is well positioned for a rebound in commercial aerospace. The bigger challenge is always tend to be the supply chain. So what we're trying to do and make sure that it's not only -- we have our house in order, and we're ready for the rebound. But also throughout the supply chain that everyone is prepared and like everything else in these businesses, it's the weakest link that tend to create issues for your businesses. And so yes, our business itself very well footed with a viewpoint of -- we think it's '23, '24 recovery. We did take some restructuring actions inside of the business. Most of it was around fixed structural costs that will not come back, things that we would have done anyway, even in a more healthy environment. And as we talked about these prior years, what we try to do in each of our businesses have what we call shovel-ready projects. And so this list of restructuring projects that we would undertake at any point in time. And then we simply accelerate them or decelerate them based upon the market environment that we're living in. And that's simply what we did in aerospace. Things that we wanted to do anyway, we would have done them any way, we simply accelerated them during this period of low economic activity, but not things that take capacity and capability to respond out of the system. So we're in great shape. And obviously, we're working with our suppliers to make sure that they're also prepared for the ramp. John Inch : It sounds like a -- it's a pretty good positioning to be in. Maybe just as a follow-up, Tom, I wanted to ask, in your first 90 days, what have you uncovered? And I'm sure with your boss sitting there, you're going to say a lot of positive things, but I'm wondering also, though, if you could talk about areas for maybe opportunities for Eaton and where your background could be additive to this, so maybe like some areas for improvement? I don't know whatever, whatever you'd like to say? Tom Okray : Yes. I appreciate it, John. I guess a few things that I've seen. The first one is just a tremendous amount of opportunity. I knew that coming in. And it's even more than I expected. And specifically in the area of organic growth, I think that's a great opportunity for us. And hopefully, that's something that I can be, additive to another thing that I've found is with all of the issues that we've been managing, whether it be commodities or supply chain, just the professionalism of the organization to get after it and just to mitigate it, has been really remarkable and the final thing is just a really top-notch leadership team that wants to win. And all of that is just a great combination, and I couldn't be happier to be here. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Jeff Hammond : Craig, I think early in the year or when you first gave your outlook, commercial construction and oil and gas were laggards. Can you just kind of frame what you're seeing there and how you're feeling about those end markets versus a couple of months ago? Craig Arnold : Yes. Appreciate the question, Jeff. And I'd say, largely speaking, I mean, in the context of what's happening in our electrical business overall, they are felt clearly laggards. Within commercial, there are certain segments that continue to do well. We've talked about, for example, warehousing, for example, as a segment that is very strong. And once again, it's another one of these markets with a much higher electrical intensity than other commercial applications. But the commercial market, I'd say, our view on it, in general, what we call commercial and institutional is that this year, we're calling that market to be flat to up slightly. But still a lag relative to the overall electrical market that we're seeing in general, and then in oil and gas, while we are another place where we're certainly seeing some green shoots and the market is certainly firming. The rig count is increasing. We're starting to see more MRO projects and the like. So that market is improving. But once again, relative to the overall electrical market, that market is still a laggard versus the overall electrical market. In that market, we're still calling to be essentially largely flat on the year, but still not a return to kind of the growth that we certainly would expect to see, perhaps beginning at the end of this year into next year. Jeff Hammond : Okay. That's helpful. And then just on vehicle, you guys raised your outlook pretty materially and certainly 1Q is a lot better. And that seems to be where a lot of the supply chain and semiconductor chip issues are. Can you just speak to kind of the push-pull of kind of raising that pretty materially versus some of the supply chain headwinds you're seeing in those markets? Craig Arnold : Yes. And I appreciate that. And I'd say that if you think about the semiconductor issue, it certainly has hit the light vehicle market harder than it has, let's say, the commercial vehicle market. I mean not to say if there aren't challenges in commercial vehicles, there are we have issues there as well, but it's certainly been a much bigger issue in the light vehicle market. And the one thing that's helped us a little bit, I would say, with respect to the way the OEMs are responding to kind of the shortages of semiconductors is that they're tending to make decisions to manufacture to produce, they're more expensive vehicles. And so what you're finding is trucks and things where they tend to make higher margins are also the places where Eaton has higher content. And so our impact in the way we're being impacted by this semiconductor issue is being somewhat muted by the way the OEMs are prioritizing what they produce. And so as we think about Q2, it's maybe a 2% to 3% impact on revenues. And revenues would have been 2% to 3% higher, but for the semiconductor issue. Overall, and so our teams are once again managing it well, but it is a real issue and one that we expect to really deal with throughout Q2 and maybe even into Q3. Operator : Thank you. We'll go to the line of Josh Pokrzywinski of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Josh Pokrzywinski : Craig, maybe to follow-up on your earlier comments in electrical. It sounded like you thought you guys were benefiting a little bit from supply chain shortages, maybe some advance ordering or, I don't know, double ordering, and people just sort of trying to get ahead of supply constraints. How much of that 23% backlog growth that you saw in the Americas would you attribute to something that's maybe a bit more atypical versus the underlying business? Just trying to get a handle on what, until the timing that mechanism might be worth? Craig Arnold : Yes. I mean, it's obviously a difficult question to really know for certain in terms of the behavior and what's going on specifically in the channel. I would say that, we probably did see some order surges that took place at the end of Q1 in the month of March. Tough to call it double ordering, I think some of that ordering could be certainly trying to get out in front of price increases, some of that or could be to put in some safety stock to protect against concerns about shortages. But I would say that overall, if you think about inventory levels -- I say inventory levels, in general, I'd say, or still probably slightly below where they really ought to be. If you think about some of the end markets of residential and others and, let's say, in some of our factory OEM equipment markets, inventory levels there are probably well below where they need to be, and we're still kind of hand to mouth with respect to dealing with some of the demand that we're seeing. And so I would say kind of the spirit of the question is, do we think this strength that we're seeing in the Electrical business has legs? Or is it a little bit of an artificial pop that we're seeing? I think mostly, we're comfortable that it's real. The underlying demand that we're seeing in these end markets is real and that's what's really driving the ordering more than anything. And we'd love to be in a position today where we actually had more inventory in that same sentiment, I would tell you would be largely true for almost, all of our customers. Josh Pokrzywinski : Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe just following up on electrical obviously, at the Analyst Day, a lot of discussion around electrification and sort of some secular shifts in the way customers are buying. As you guys are bidding on projects, is there some, I don't know, higher content level that you're seeing show up that would suggest this is playing out? Or is this just kind of project velocity picking up rather than, I guess, project content? Craig Arnold : No. I would say that it's both. It's both velocity and it's also content. And one I always go back to, which is an easy one to relate to, it's really what's going on even in residential construction today. If you think about today, the electrical content in your homes as you move from a standard mechanical circuit breaker to an electronic circuit breaker or a circuit breaker that has the ability to do fault protection. I mean, we're seeing more electrical content in almost every project that we participate in, in almost every single end market. I just think this idea of -- as we talk about the digitization connectivity, these broader secular growth trends are really requiring an increase in the electrical content in the equipment that we provide. So I would say it's both. It's both the velocity of projects as well as increased content on every project that we sell. Operator : We'll go next to the line of Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Joe Ritchie : So Craig, I know you've been pretty front footed on the investments that you've been making on the e-mobility offering. Saw this interesting announcement last week with ABB, like initiating a carve-out of their business, their business being smaller than your business today. I'm just curious, you guys have been front footed as well in terms of your portfolio. I guess how are you thinking about this business longer term? And is this a potential opportunity for a carve-out of this business as you build momentum? Craig Arnold : Yes. We obviously filed that announcement as well from ABB. And I'd say that every company has got their own strategy around how you unlock value in your organization. And as we think about the connectivity between what we do in our e-mobility business with our broader electrical business, we see just tons of synergies between them. And so we really think about that as being a key growth platform for Eaton and a great source of synergies with respect to the way we develop technology, the way we leverage scale in our supply chain. And so we really do see it as an integrated part of our company as we go forward. If you think about one of the examples that we mentioned in the earnings call today around this break tour technology, which is basically a resettable circuit breaker that's used in a vehicle application in a market that has historically only used fuses, that's a great example. That core technology came from our electrical business. That's where it was developed and so our e-mobility team lifted that technology naturally modified it for the commercial vehicle space. and here, we landed a number of key wins that are, we think, at maturity we could be talking about this $100 million worth of business in this kind of space around this break door technology once we get to full maturity and we bed down all the wins that we're working on right now. So, we really do see it as a core piece of the way we run the Company, the way we leverage our scale and the way we'll ultimately grow our business and synergies that will flow back to both our electrical and to our e-mobility segment. Joe Ritchie : Makes a lot of sense, Greg. I appreciate the color there. I guess my follow-on question, and I know we've talked a lot about different end market trends, but I'd be curious if you guys could quantify how April has been trending relative to some of the intra-quarter trends that you saw in the first quarter? Craig Arnold : Yes. I'd say that we had a good April. And actually, we're working to get some rather modest comps given COVID-19 last year. But the month of April for us came in very strong and came in actually slightly better than what we were forecasting. And so at this juncture, we think everything is looking good for another strong quarter in Q2. Operator : Next we'll go to the line of Ann Duignan of JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Ann Duignan : Most of my questions have been answered. But just maybe on the electrical side, can you talk about any growing interest or quoting in terms of state and local government, either retrofitting for renewable energy requirements or retrofitting for modernization of infrastructure, are you seeing any of that kind of activity pick back up? I mean taking local budgets are in better shape than we might have anticipated now with all the money they've gotten in terms of aid. I'm just curious if you're seeing any evidence of green shoots there. Craig Arnold : Yes, I appreciate that question as well, Ann, and you're absolutely right. I mean the infrastructure needs in our country are vast and what's happening today in terms of the stimulus programs that are being either approved already or proposed by the Biden administration are going to put significant dollars in the hands of both state and local governments. And I can tell you today, it's early days. In terms of what's been approved already, I'd say that we are starting to see some of those projects. And when you look at kind of the C-30 report, the public sector has tended to be a little stronger than the private sector. When you think about what's going on in commercial construction. And so we obviously have seen some of that already. But the biggest piece of it, we think, is still out in front of us. And we think that -- and obviously, it's going to depend upon where these dollars go in terms of this infrastructure build. If it's in roads and bridges, that probably won't have a material impact on our company. But if it's where the Biden administration is pointing a lot of those dollars, whether that's in the reduced energy consumption, the greening of the economy, electrification of the economy, building out the electrical infrastructure, grid resiliency, a lot of the things that the administration are talking about not baked into our current forecast and outlook could be another real, I'd say, leg of growth for our company and we're hopeful. But I think today, we've seen very little of that really show up in our business. Ann Duignan : Okay. That's helpful. And then just back on Green Motion on the electrical charging company in Europe, can you talk a little bit about what is so differentiated about that company because we think that charging as being commoditized very quickly over time? I mean, the barriers to entry are not that high, and it's very regional and there's standard issues across different countries, I mean, just talk a little bit about hi-tech company and why you think they will be the winner? Craig Arnold : Yes. I'd say, clearly, when you think about the charging infrastructure side of there is obviously the hardware and I think when you think about the piece that's -- today, you could argue is not very differentiated. It's really the hardware itself. It's the equipment. We view that as really more of as a gateway and the real value creation really comes in the software associated with how do you manage the charging infrastructure. And so yes, they have charging, and they have the hardware associated with charging and that piece for us is interesting because we do think that depending upon the application that you're in, all charging isn't the same. There is an opportunity, we believe, depending upon which segment of the market you're serving, where the charging infrastructure in and of itself is important. We think there's an opportunity to really pull-through and couple the charging infrastructure with what we do on the electrical equipment on year side, which we think will be value creating. But the real value ultimately is really in the software and the way the solutions around how do you manage the charging of vehicles, of fleets, manage the load in a smart way in a really complex environment. And that's ultimately where we see the biggest value and what really intrigued us a lot about what Green Motion has already done and the ability to do billing as well and what Green Motion has already done in the Nordic countries. Operator : And we have time for one more question that will come from the line of Julian Mitchell of Barclays. Please go ahead. Julian Mitchell : Maybe just a clarification question around the free cash flow, I don't think anyone's asked about it yet, but that guidance was unchanged, I think, from before. The adjusted net income guide was raised by about \u00a3200 million. So just wondered what the moving pieces are? Is it around bigger working capital headwinds? Or is it more to do with perhaps a lot of those sort of adjustments to EPS noncash? Just wanted to check on that? Thank you. Craig Arnold : Julian, I think the way to think about it, the working capital piece, it's just early. I'd say that today, we are dealing with a number of uncertainties as it relates to supply chain, and we may need to build a little bridge inventory to deal with some of these supply chain challenges. And so the way I think about it more than anything is, it's just early in the year and some uncertainty around how some of the supply chain challenges are going to work their way through the system. As you saw in the numbers, we had a very strong Q1 and in free cash flow, better than our plan for sure. And there's nothing particularly that we can see today that would prevent that from playing through for the year, but it's just early and there's a number of these uncertainties around what's going on in the supply chain. And that's what kind of held us back from taking that guidance up at this point. Julian Mitchell : And then just a quick follow-up on aerospace specifically, the margin guide for the year embeds maybe a 200, 300-point step-up from Q1 for the balance of the year. I assume that's commercial aftermarket recovering and carrying a very high mix tailwind with it. Maybe just help us understand what your assumption is for commercial aftermarket sales growth for the year in that context? Craig Arnold : Yes. So commercial aftermarket, the aftermarket typically lags the OEM by a quarter or two and so we are certainly expecting a lift in aftermarket as we get into the second half of the year, and that's certainly going to be very much accretive to margins overall. So that's certainly baked into our assumptions. And the other place, as I said, we did a lot of restructuring in the Company. A lot of that went into Aerospace. And certainly, as our restructuring programs get completed we'll see those benefits as well show up in our expanded margins. But we're very comfortable with the margin outlook for Aerospace. Even in Q1, the margins that we delivered in that business of 18.5%, very attractive margins on volumes are down dramatically. And so as we think about the business and the margin profile overall, nothing that I'd say would be extraordinary or Herculean in our effort to deliver the forecast. Yan Jin : Okay, guys, I think thanks for all the questions. As always, Chip, and I will be available for any follow-up questions. Have a good day. Craig Arnold : All right. Thank you. Yan Jin : Thank you, guys. Bye. Operator : Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T event conferencing.

At this point, all the participants are in a listen-only mode. However, there will be an opportunity for your questions. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's call is being recorded.  I'll turn the call now over to Yan Jin, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Jin, please go ahead. Yan Jin : Hey, good morning, guys. I'm Yan Jin, Eaton's Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you all for joining us for Eaton's Second Quarter 2020 earning call. With me today are Craig Arnold, our Chairman and CEO, and Tom Okray, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer. Our agenda today includes the opening remarks by Craig highlighting the Company's performance in the second quarter.  As we have done our past calls, we'll be taking questions at the end of Craig's comments. The price release and the presentation we'll go through today have been posted on our website at www.eaton.com. This presentation including adjusted earnings per share, adjusted free cash flow, and other non-GAAP measures. There are [Indiscernible] in the Appendix. A webcast of this call is accessible on our website and will be available for replay.  I would like to remind you that our comments today will include statements related to the expected future results of the Company, and are therefore Forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our forecasted projection due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and presentation. With that, I will turn it over to Craig. Craig Arnold : Okay. Thanks, Jin. So we'll start on page 3 like we normally do with highlights of the quarter. And I'll summarize by saying that we had another very strong quarter, and we're seeing significant increases obviously in our markets, and as a result of that, we're taking our \u201821 guidance up for the second time. Our teams continue to perform at a very high level despite significant supply chain disruptions and rising commodity costs. Q2 adjusted earnings of $1.72 were a Q2 record, 15% above the midpoint of our guidance; and earnings were up nearly 100% versus last year, and importantly 20% sequentially. Our sales were $5.2 billion, up 35%, 27% organically and above the midpoint of our guidance. For the Second Quarter in a row, we delivered record segment margins. Q2 margins were 18.6%, up 390 basis points from prior year, and up 90 basis points sequentially.  We're also pleased with our incremental margins of 30%, we think strong results given the material cost headwinds that we're facing. Our order growth was perhaps the biggest highlight of the quarter. Orders were up more than 40% in each of our Electrical segments and both ended the quarter with a record backlog, and our portfolio transformation continues. We closed the acquisition of Cobham Mission Systems and our 50% ownership in Jiangsu YiNeng Electric business in China.  We're also pleased to have completed the sale of Hydraulics to Danfoss yesterday for $3.3 billion. The sale of Hydraulics is certainly a successful outcome for Eaton, our shareholders, and for Danfoss who we think will be an excellent owner of the business. And we want to thank our former Hydraulics employees for their loyal service to Eaton and we wish them well under the leadership of Danfoss. Lastly, we continue to make strong progress on our strategic growth initiatives, and I'll point out just a few highlights on the next slide.  So, turning to page 4, you've heard us talk about the three most important secular growth trends for the Company; electrification, energy transition, and digitalization. We're making significant progress in all three areas, and we're seeing strong results. Highlighting a few notable examples, I'll begin with electrification where we've had significant wins in both our electrical and vehicle businesses. In vehicle, we delivered $50 million of new wins for our electric vehicle powertrains, which includes EV transmission, EV gearing, and EV differential.  And I'm noting this example because it demonstrates that even in an area where many of you think about as our traditional vehicle business, electrification is creating very large growth opportunities for the Company. In Electrical, as you would expect, our team secured attractive wins tied to renewable energy and residential applications. In this case, we're noting a win with a leading solar and energy storage OEM. In energy transition, we recently won a large distributed energy management project for a leading financial services Company. This is a greenfield project and a great example of building as a grid solution. Eaton will be providing the low- and medium-voltage switchgear, our Foreseer electrical power monitoring software, and our microgrid controller. In digitalization, our Brightlayer team delivered a win in the industrial market with a leading global chemical processing Company to provide remote monitoring software solutions. In this application, our solutions really leverage Eaton's portfolio of electrical hardware along with our expertise in power management to provide the customer with real-time operational data, alarms, and insights that are delivered directly to their mobile devices.  In addition to the operating benefits, the customer will be able to use Brightlayer\u2019s industrial trending and measurement data to optimize energy usage. So, it's an exciting time to be at the center of these three growth trends, and we'll certainly keep you updated as we continue to progress in this area. Moving to page 5, we summarize our Q2 results, and I'll point out just a couple of highlights here.  First, on 35% total revenue growth, we delivered a 71% increase in operating profit. So, very strong operating leverage. Second, our adjusted earnings of $690 million, increased by 99%. We're also effectively managing our corporate costs. Overall, our teams are certainly executing at a very high level. We are efficiently managing supply chain constraints, increasing productivity, and delivering the expected benefits from our multiyear restructuring program, and a trend that we expect to continue for the balance of the year.  Turning to page six, we summarize the results of our Electrical Americas segment. Revenues were up 15% organically, driven by strength in residential and datacenter markets, but we also had solid growth in commercial and institutional markets as well. The acquisition of Tripp Lite added 8%, and favorable currency added 1%. Looking at our sequential growth, we were up 8% over Q1. And historically, we have seen a 5% lift between the quarters, so I'd say our growth rate is accelerating here.  Our operating margins increased 60 basis points to 21.3%, a Q2 record. This is 190 basis points above pre-pandemic levels in Q2 of 2019. Our portfolio changes, the sale of Lighting and the acquisition of Tripp Lite, solid execution, and benefits once again from our multiyear restructuring program all contributed to the improvement. We're also pleased with the 43% growth in orders in the quarter, a 13% increase on a rolling 12-month basis.  This led to also a 43% increase in our backlog, which now sits at record levels. We had broad order strength in all end markets with particular strength once again in data centers, residential, and commercial and institutional. You'll recall that at the end of Q1, we started to see some large orders in select commercial markets. This pattern strengthened in Q2, and our negotiation pipeline in the commercial market was up significantly.  Data, all data would suggest that the second half of the year and really going into 2022 should see solid growth. Turning to page 7, you will see the financial summary of our Electrical Global segment, and as you can see, we had strong organic growth here, up 22% and currency added some 6%. Like the Americas, organic revenue growth was driven by residential and data center markets, but we also had broad-based strength in commercial and institutional and utility and in industrial markets as well.  We posted strong operating margins of 18.3%, once again a Q2 record, up 230 basis points from last year and up 130 basis points sequentially. The incremental margins on an organic basis were solid at 32%, the result once again of good cost control and benefits from our multiyear restructuring program. Orders were also very strong, up some 46% from last year and up 10% on a rolling 12-month basis.  Once again, we had strength across all markets with particular strength in data center and residential markets, and we ended the quarter with record backlog, up some 50% from last year. Moving to page 8, we show the results of our Aerospace segment. While we have a long way to go, we're starting to see signs of recovery in this market, which posted 17% growth in the quarter. As you know, we closed the Cobham transaction on June 1, and the business delivered solid results in the month of June, adding 16% to our quarterly revenue. Currency also added 3%. Operating margins were 21%, up 600 basis points from last year, and 250 basis points sequentially. With improving volumes, the team executed extremely well, delivering 50% incremental margins on an organic basis. Orders on a rolling 12-month basis are still down from 16%, but this is an improvement from down 36% in Q1. In fact, sequentially, orders were up 12%. The commercial industry is seeing an increase in leisure travel, especially in domestic markets, but international travel continued to be down sharply.  We think the market will grow over the next several years, but we don't expect it to return to 2019 levels until 2024. Lastly, our backlog here has stabilized and was flat with the last year. Next, on Page 9, you see the financial results of our vehicle segment. Organic revenues more than doubled with strength in all regions. Operating margins were 17.9%, and we delivered very strong incremental margins which were over 40%. The margin performance was driven by a higher volume certainly, but also once again from the benefit from the multiyear restructuring program. And despite volumes still being down some 10% to 15% below pre-pandemic levels, the business is really already sitting on the cusp of achieving our long-term margin target of 18%. Now turning to page 10, we show a summary of our e-mobility business. Revenues were up 57%, 54% percent organically, 3% from positive currency.  The organic revenues were driven by strong growth really in all e-mobility markets around the world. The operating margins were a negative 6.8%, and they continued to be depressed by heavy investments in new programs. As you know, we're investing in this segment in high-voltage power electronics and power distribution and power protection, but you should also be aware that we have significantly expanded our view of the market here. We now see large opportunities for our traditional business in the e-mobility segment. These technologies include EV gearing, EV transmissions, and torque control solutions. As I noted earlier and we already have wins in these areas. In fact, our traditional products have increased the size of the addressable market for e-mobility. We think some $5 billion, and so it continue to be a really exciting segment and a big part of the Company's future. Moving to page 11, we've updated our guidance for 2021 on organic revenue. And as you can see, we are significantly increasing our organic revenue growth for the second time this year with an increase in most segments. In fact, we're raising the midpoint of our organic growth guidance by 400 basis points from 8% to 12%. And this is on top of a 300 basis point increase that we took in Q1. The largest increases are in Electrical Global and Vehicle with smaller increases as you can see in the Americas in e-mobility. With a very strong first-half robust order book and a growing backlog, we're comfortable with an 11% to 13% growth outlook for the year. This is despite -- quite frankly some of our markets that remain in the weak sale are in the early stages of recovery, notably commercial construction, industrial, oil and gas, and commercial aerospace.  We expect to see certainly continued recovery in these markets over the balance of this year, and we think it bodes well for 2022. Next on Page 12, we show an update on our segment margin guidance for the year. For Eaton overall, we're increasing segment margins by a 30 basis point at the midpoint from 18.3% to 18.6%, which will once again be an all-time record for the Company. The 30 basis point increase, as you know, follows the 50 basis point increase that we reported following our Q1 Earnings Call. And we've raised the margin guidance in each of our segments with the exception of e-mobility. We continue to expect organic incremental margins of around 30% and for price and commodity cost to be approximately neutral for the year. Our team has certainly been very effective at managing through these complexities related to price increases and supply chain constraints, and we would expect this to continue through the balance of the year. And on page 13, we have the remaining items of our 2021 guidance. We're raising our full-year adjusted Earnings per Share by 60% to a range of $6,000.58 to $6,000.88. At the midpoint, $6,000.73. This is an increase of 10% over our private prior guidance and a 37% increase over 2020. You'll recall that we raised guidance by $0.50 in Q1. With this increase, we are now forecasting a 20% increase from the midpoint of our original guidance which was $5.60. With our recent M&A activities, we now see net headwinds of 1% from acquisitions and divestitures. And this is down from our prior outlook of 4%. And we now expect a positive currency of $350 million up from our prior forecast of $200 million. And we're also raising our guidance for adjusted operating cash flow and adjusted free cash flow, both up to $200 million at the midpoint.  The increase is really driven by a combination of higher profit on organic growth in sales, the timing of acquisitions and divestitures, but also partially offset by some investments that we're making in working capital given the current constrained supply chain environment. The remaining components of our full-year guidance remain unchanged. And lastly, our Q3 guidance is as follows : we expect Earnings to be about $0.72 to $1.82. Organic revenues to be up 11% to 13% and percentile margins to come in between 19% and 19.4%.  And lastly, I will wrap up the presentation on page 14. You've heard us talk for the last few years about Eaton's transformation into an intelligent power management Company. This strategy is built on a belief that there are a few growth trends. Electrification, Energy Transition, and Digitalization, that allow the Company to grow at a much faster rate than we have historically. And every day we get confirmations that we're on the right path. We're seeing it in the growing importance of sustainability initiatives in society.  We're seeing it in government spending. And we're certainly seeing it in our opportunities and in our win. We're pleased with the progress that we've made on the portfolio. Each move has been consistent with our objectives of delivering a Company that has faster growth, higher margins, and better Earnings consistency. And you've seen our track record on margin expansion. The Eaton business system is what provides the consistent approach to how we run the Company, how we execute, and how we expand margins and it's working.  And this enables us to be on track to expand margins by 400-500 basis points over the 5-year planning period. And as you can see we are running ahead of plan. And we're committed to our sustainability goals. They reflect the right thing to do for society, but just as importantly, sustainability is at the core of what's driving our growth. I'd also note that we published our 2020 sustainability report and our first task force on climate-related financial disclosure report at the end of June.  It encouraged those of you who have a special interest in sustainability to read it. I think they're extremely well done and reflect the direction the Company's headed in. Lastly, we continue to generate very attractive cash flows. Over $9 billion through 2025, which will allow us to return cash to shareholders and also make investments to grow the Company. And as you can see, we're off to a very strong start in 2021. At the midpoint of our guidance, once again, revenue is expected to grow 12% and Earnings by 37%. So with that, I will turn it back to Yan (ph) and open the line for questions. Yan Jin : Okay. Great, John. Thanks, Greg. For the Q&A section of our call today, we would like to ask you to limit you to just one question and one follow-up. Thanks for your cooperation. With that, I'll turn it over to the Operator to give you guys the instruction. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And first on the line of Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley, please go ahead. Josh Pokrzywinski : Hi, good morning, guys. Craig Arnold : Good morning, Josh. Josh Pokrzywinski : So, Craig, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the composition in orders in Electrical. Clearly, pretty solid there, but hoping for a little bit more color on maybe the cyclical momentum versus the secular electrification.  So, I appreciate the examples on slide 3, but really trying to get how much of this is sort of illustrative versus something that you see really moving the needle here in the short to medium term? Craig Arnold : I'd say it's really a combination to your point, Josh, of both of those. The orders were really strong across all geographies and end markets with, as I mentioned, the highest growth coming in data centers and residential. And we talked about the secular growth trends that will be such an important part of the future of the Company. We still believe strongly that we're just in the early innings of really seeing a material impact from some of these bigger secular growth trends that are going to drive, we think, the future of the organization.  We're not seeing any benefits around government infrastructure spending yet. And so, I'd say a lot of what you're seeing today, I just think is a reflection of the broader strength in many of our end markets, and certainly we always talk about data centers as the great example of the [indiscernible] consuming and processing and storing increasing amounts of data. So, I think a lot of what you're seeing today is restocking because markets certainly have been strong in many of our end markets, and inventories were taken down pretty hard on the pandemic last year. And so, I'd like to say once again, broad-based strength. We talked about the fact that there's been a lot of stuff written about what's going to happen with commercial construction. Commercial construction has come back very strongly, and we had outstanding orders as well as negotiations in the commercial and institutional side of the business as well.  So, it really has been a story of fairly broad-based strength in orders across almost every end market and every geography. So, at this juncture, we think we're at the very front end of what should be a pretty exciting runway as we look forward as some of the longer cycle businesses we talked about whether that commercial construction, or oil and gas, or some of these other markets, large projects start to come back into the business. We think this should go on for a while as well. Josh Pokrzywinski : Got it. And then just on the incrementals, you guys are going to be in the low-to-mid 30 this year coming off of really great decremental margin control last year, and presumably some stranded costs for Hydraulics and I think pretty well-documented inflationary environment.  I mean, is the normalized range, once we kind of clear some of the noise out of that, still in this 30% to 35%, or can we go higher as maybe some of these headwinds normalize or dissipate? Craig Arnold : We think that 30% incremental for planning guideline still makes sense at this point, as you think about modeling the Company on a go-forward basis. Clearly, we're having to make some fairly sizable investments in the business right now as we deal with a revenue growth outlook that's more robust than what we've seen historically. So, we'll be putting some investments in the business. We\u2019re also obviously investing pretty heavily right now in electrification and places like e-mobility as well as in other aspects of the business, like in the Brightlayer platform that we're bringing online.  We think that that 30% incremental number is still a good planning guideline as you think about modeling the future of the organization. And at large, I think on the basis of the investments that we're going to be making in the business, that perhaps will hold back what could be an incremental story that would expand.  But given the investments that we think are important to make for the future growth of the Company, we think 30% makes a lot of sense. Josh Pokrzywinski : Understood. Appreciate all the comments. Thanks. Craig Arnold : Thank you. Operator : And next question is from Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Andrew Obin : Yes, good morning. Craig Arnold : Good morning, Andrew. Andrew Obin : Yes. Just maybe to go into little bit more depth on commercial construction for second half in '22, what are you hearing from the customers and just trying to get a sense of how much visibility is there into 2022? Craig Arnold : Yeah. I appreciate your question on commercial construction. That's obviously been a point of a lot of debate in general. And so, as we talked about in Q2, our order growth of commercial structure was really in line with the rest of the business with more than 40% growth for the entire sector.  And with, quite frankly, particular strength in the global segment as well. And so, we continue to see positive signs in commercial construction markets, and we don't think there's any reason why there should be any let-up in those markets that we think about going to the second half of this year or into 2022. Our negotiation pipelines, which as we talked about on prior calls proceeds in order obviously. And our negotiation pipeline for both light commercial as well as large commercial projects, including commercial buildings was up very strongly year-on-year and up actually very strongly, sequentially as well.  And so at this juncture, we're optimistic that commercial construction will come back and we think the second half of this year and into next year should post fairly strong growth. Andrew Obin : Thank you, Craig. And just my follow-up question, this has been a strange recovery, but your industrial customers, do you see them thinking about CapEx differently? I think you did highlight before your high content in [Indiscernible] facilities, so that's one secular growth driver. But what kind of longer-term conversations are you having? And do you think people are thinking differently about CapEx needs this cycle versus the prior decade? Thank you. Craig Arnold : I think it's fair to say that on the industrial side of the house in general, really across many of our end markets, there\u2019s probably been historically some underinvestment. So I think that on the one hand there is going to be some catch-up that needs to take place.  Then I think the big challenge that everybody is dealing with is fairly sizable labor shortages in many of the markets around the world, and so investments in industrial and automation and the like tends to be what follows.  And so, we think the industrial markets or another one of these markets that I think in the relatively early stages of recovery, there has been relative underinvestment in manufacturing over the last number of years, and so we think that market should do well into '22 and really quite frankly, beyond. Andrew Obin : Thank you so much. Operator : Next, we'll go to Scott Davis with Melius Research. Please go ahead. Scott Davis : Hi. Good morning, guys. Craig Arnold : Good morning, Scott. Scott Davis : Craig, can you talk a little bit about where you guys -- what's your strategy in EV charging whether kind of content with being a sub-supplier into it or whether you want to perhaps take a bigger role there or what? I'll just leave it at that. Craig Arnold : Yeah. Yeah. This is certainly very much at the core of our strategy for our electrical business, and Uday Yadav and the team spent some time during our Investor Day really taking you through strategically what we're trying to get done there. And it's one of the reasons why we made the acquisition of Green Motion. You know, we acquired Green Motion, which is a European Company that does everything from the physical hardware of charging all the way through the charge port operating and billing systems, and so we think that e-charging whether that's at residential, commercial buildings, or really more on a grid-scale or in the bigger industrial applications, is going to be an important part of what we're trying to do inside of our Electrical business.  Those markets, as you've seen and you see it reflected in some of the infrastructure bills that are being proposed in the U.S., you see fairly sizable investments that are taking place in Europe and in Asia.  So we do think e-charging, both in the physical hardware as well as in the software will be an important part of what we're going to try to get done in our Electrical business. That's an exciting space that's going to grow dramatically and we'd expect to be a part of it. Scott Davis : Okay. Helpful. And then just as a follow-up on e-mobility. Can you give us a sense of the wins that you're getting. What is a good look like on a content story for you guys on an Electrical Vehicle? And it can just be an illustration or example if you want, but trying to get a sense of that. Thanks. Craig Arnold : It's tough to really pick a typical e-mobility Vehicle, but I will tell you that as we talked about once again in our investor day that the content opportunity for e-tech in an e-mobility application is a huge multiple of what we saw on our legacy business.  And whether that in some of the new electronic based inverters, converters, power distribution. But I said it also, even in our legacy Vehicle business and that's what we're really highlighting this quarter that you think about this legacy business that we had and you say, what's going to happen to that business in the context of the world, transition to electric vehicle.  We say, there's a huge growth opportunity in gears, in differentials, hybrid transmissions for our legacy business as well. And so those opportunities for us and we laid out a goal of getting to $2 billion to $4 billion between now and 2030. But the opportunity set is much larger in order of magnitude, 5, 10 times greater than it would be for our traditional Vehicle business where we're doing valve and valve actuation and some charging.  So it's tough to pick a typical Vehicle. I can tell you where we have wins, what we have headwinds. Once again, these wins and these opportunities are coming once again in multiples of 5x to 10x what we would have on an historical of Vehicle platform. Scott Davis : Good luck, Craig. Thank you. Craig Arnold : Thank you. Operator : Our next question's from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Joe Ritchie : Thanks, guys. Good morning and congrats on the quarter. Craig Arnold : Thanks, Joe. Appreciate it. Joe Ritchie : Craig, maybe just -- I know you talked about the price cost equation basically being neutral for the year, but I'm just curious like as it relates to Q2 and the rest of the year, like what did that look like in Q2 for you guys?  And then is there any particular Quarter where we should expect any headwinds? Just any thoughts around like how far ahead you are of inflation at this point? Craig Arnold : Yeah, I appreciate the question, and we are obviously dealing with fairly sizable challenges in and around supply chain and probably no secret in and out of the call. When we provided our Q2 earnings guidance at the end of Q1, we had an expectation around the amount of commodity inflation that we would see in the business and commodity prices, quite frankly, have only gone up.  And in some cases fairly significantly since that time. So we've naturally as an organization of had to continue to work to offset additional commodity Price inflation more than what we anticipated. And I really think about that whole thing, maybe even shifting a full quarter in terms of the pressure points that we expected to see in the business.  And so at this juncture, when we think about the year, we're calling the year neutral, we don't think it gets worse in terms of the impact in our Company and the balance between pricing costs but we think the year is neutral. And we think the pressure points in Q3 are going to be probably as great as what we expected in Q2. As a result, quite frankly, we're seeing commodity prices continue to run. And once again, we're running to obviously catch up with that in terms of the things that we're doing around taking prices up in the market, as well as working on things to take costs out of the organization.  So neutral for the year, things have probably shifted according to the right, based upon the fact that commodity prices have continued to run. Joe Ritchie : Got it. That's helpful context and I guess maybe my quick follow-up question. One area that really surprised us to the upside this quarter with your aero margin. I was wondering if you can maybe try to help parse out what really benefited Aero this quarter, and should we start thinking about 20+ like a baseline as we start to see the recovery in the commercial Aero business? Craig Arnold : Yeah. And I think, if you think about in simple terms, our team, when we were dealing with kind of this pretty dramatic downturn last year and setting an expectation that we would not see these markets come back to 2024.  The team, very proactively and aggressively put in a number of restructuring program to take out some of the fixed costs that we knew would be a challenge on a go-forward basis and so, I would really attribute it to the team being proactive, putting in the restructuring early in the downturn, and then really doing an effective job of running the business as well as managing costs. In terms of the expectation going forward, yeah, I think it's reasonable to say that as this business improves, we approached 25% return on sales in our aerospace business back in 2019 prior to the downturn, and our goal is certainly to get back to those numbers.  But I do think something north of 20% is where really we'd expect this business to perform and certainly, as volume comes back to work our way back towards the 24% to 25% return on sales that we used to be at. Joe Ritchie : Makes sense. Thank you. Operator : Next question is from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Brandon Rig : Hey, Craig. Hey, this is Brandon Rig in for Nigel Coe. I just want to piggyback off of that Aero comment. Also not in the spotlight on the top-line, but certainly very strong performance on the margin. Maybe just some more color on the components of Aerospace.  Like how did commercial OE, commercial aftermarket defense perform in Q2? And maybe just a follow-up would be, what is the outlook for defense, has it changed at all since our last update? Thank you. Craig Arnold : Yeah, I appreciate the question. And I'd say that our Aerospace business, probably is not too much of an outlier from what you've seen from others in the market. Clearly, the commercial side of the house continues to be under pretty significant pressure, while we're certainly seeing revenue passenger kilometers return. Those markets are still running well below where they ran in 2019. We did see a little bit of an improvement in aftermarket in the quarter as that business certainly off dramatically last year, and so I'd say that the Commercial OE continues to be weak, commercial aftermarket still weak versus where we've been historically but improving.  And really on the military side of the house, I'd say pretty much no change. And we think about that business being kind of a low single-digit grower is our outlook for the military market. And we think that pretty much consistent with what we think the outlook is going to be over the near-term as well. So a lot of the point again, the margin piece really, I'd say mostly a function of our team's ability to execute wasn't in any way driven by, let's say, a dramatic and mix shift to aftermarket business overall. Operator : Our next question is from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research, please go ahead? Jeff Sprague : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Craig Arnold : Morning, Jeff. Jeff Sprague : Hey, good morning. Maybe just a question on backlog conversion and also just kind of the scramble going on in the channel. Craig, you mentioned, you did -- I think you saw some channel inventory rebuild out there.  We've heard a lot of mixed things from other companies on that, things like people would like to rebuild inventory but can't because there's not availability, et cetera, but maybe you could just give us a little bit of color on that dynamic and do you think we're somewhat caught up on inventory relative to where the demand is? Craig Arnold : The way I'd characterize it today as we think about going to channel checks with our distributor partners, I'd say on balance, in aggregate, inventory levels probably matched the outlook for the demand that we expect.  But then, there are certainly certain segments of the market where we are woefully short and good point, taken point would be what's happening today in the residential market. Currently in the residential markets in Electrical well sure of where we should be and our distributors have not been able to restock. I think the fact that we're building fairly sizable backlog, is a reflection of the fact that some of these end markets would like to have more inventory than they are currently sitting on. But in aggregate, I do think that Inventory is probably largely in line with our view and our outlook and attributes outlook for the market going forward other than in certainly of the sub segment of the market. Jeff Sprague : And so the backlog growth you would attribute mostly, or sounds like, completely to demand side as opposed to your maybe inability to deliver a few things in the quarter? Craig Arnold : No, I think there's a combination. I just think, as we mentioned, there are these certain sub-segments of the market where clearly there's more demand in residential construction, as an example, then we have the ability to ship.  So I think it's a combination of the two, but I think on aggregate, once again markets are good. The underlying demand is good in most of these end markets and there's certainly no inventory buildup taking place to the channel. But I do think that the fact the backlog has grown to the extent that it has, once again a record backlog in both the Americas and global up some 40% plus in both segments.  I'd say is that mostly a function of the fact that the markets are rebounding quite nicely right now. Jeff Sprague : Right. And maybe just a follow-up, if I could, just on the you called out at the end of your remarks in your commentary on your deals capacity, things are heating up and obviously you guys have been super busy yourself. Maybe you could just comment a little bit on the pipeline whether the organization can do more, is ready to do more, and what might be actionable or is there something else that's actionable before your end year? Craig Arnold : And I appreciate the comment that the team has been I'd say very successful at really bedding down a number of acquisitions that are very strategic, very attractive multiples we think as well. And it is to your point, I'd say the deal activity is certainly heated up and the pipeline today is probably about as full as it's been in some time.  And I'd say we do have capacity, depending upon which segment of the business you're talking about. I'd say that one of the good things about being an organization that works across multiple businesses and industries is that -- and doing the deals, the size that we've done is that none of these deals are going to be so big that they could really consume the capacity of the entire Company.  And so, if you're talking about some of the things that we've done recently in Aerospace, they may be a little bit full on the fuel and motion side of the business but we have capacity may be on the other side, the same thing would be true in Electrical. We really haven't done very large deals in Electrical. We've done very strategic deals.  We've done deals that I think are outstanding in addition to the portfolio. But I'd say by and large, in our Electrical business, we have plenty of capacity organizationally to go out and find opportunities, and to bring them in and integrated them in.  And that will not be a bottleneck or limiter in terms of our ability to actually go out and transact. And we continue to say once from a priority standpoint, we continue to be focused on Electrical and Aerospace as the 2 places that will likely to deploy capital. Jeff Sprague : Great. Thank you. Operator : Next, we'll go to Nicole Deblase with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Nicole Deblase : Yeah, thanks. Good morning, guys. Craig Arnold : Good morning, Nicole. Nicole Deblase : Can we just clarify a couple of things in the guidance? I guess, how much of the raise EPS came from the early close of Cobham and Hydraulics in for an extra Quarter? And then can you just also clarify, did you include one month of Hydraulics in the 3Q Guidance given that the deal closed in August or has that been removed from 3Q? Craig Arnold : We -- just maybe I'll work backwards. Certainly, we own Hydraulics for the month of August and so for that month, we did in fact include Hydraulics in the guide. And so that would add 4% [Indiscernible] Craig. Craig Arnold : So if you look at the $0.63 [Indiscernible] increase. First of all, we flowed through the $0.22 fee. And within that $0.22 fee, we had about $0.07 that's related to M&A timing, Hydraulics, $0.03 Carbon's. And then we had another $0.13 which was $0.04 for Hydraulics and $0.09 Carbones. So, in total, M&A timing was $0.20 of the $0.35, which is $0.22 flow through in the $0.13 for the remaining timing. And then the remaining $0.28 is related to operational performance. Nicole Deblase : Okay. That's really clear. Thanks for that verification. And then I guess, can we just talk a little bit about what you guys are seeing in China? Obviously, a lot of noise with what's going on from a data perspective and questions about stimulus from here. But have you seen any slowing in your business? Craig Arnold : You know, I'd say no. I mean, our business in China grew quite strongly. We reported as a part of our Electrical Global segment, but I would say that that underlying strength that you saw in our Electrical Global segment is also reflective of what we've seen in our chain a business as well.  The market, we'll see what the future holds, but the market today has performed extremely well and our team has performed extremely well in addition to that. One of the things for us, we've always believed in manufacturing and being local in local markets. And it's one of the reasons why we've made these investments in these joint ventures.  Two of them that we've done so far in China to really expand our access to the market. These huge tier-2 and tier-3 markets in China that we've historically not participated in. These 2 JVs, I tell you, really create an exciting opportunity for our Company as we move forward to really participate in the largest segments of that market with really strong partners in China. So, for us, I'd say market is important.  Perhaps, even more important than the market is really our opportunity to penetrate the market and grow market share on the basis of really now participating in these very large segments of the market that historically had been closed to us. Nicole Deblase : Thanks, Craig, I'll pass it on. Operator : Next. We'll go to David Raso (ph) with Evercore ISI (ph). Please go ahead. David Raso : Hi. Thanks for the time. On the Electrical focus for M&A. Can you help us think through where the areas of focus is moving forward? Is it more geographic? Is it [Indiscernible] ideally a technology that can cross geography and verticals, but just give us a stance of where you see the portfolio from here still having opportunities and maybe some holes. And then I just wanted to follow up on the strong doubling of organic sales growth guide for Electrical Global. Maybe a little more color on what's accelerating so much from your thoughts 3 months ago and maybe update us if you could on just currently the geographic sales mix of Electrical Global. Craig Arnold : Yeah. So on the M&A focused question specifically, I'd say that if you just think about it strategically, we've laid out, as a Company, these three major secular growth trends over Electrification, energy transition, digitalization.  That will be kind of a good kind of framework when you think about where we are likely to deploy M&A dollars in terms of following these strategic growth factors that we think are important to the Company. When you think about acquiring a Company like Green Motion, you think about acquiring a Company like Tripp Lite, which is really in datacenters, in 5G expansion.  Especially as you think about what we've done, they ought to be really thought about it as an expressions of the strategy in the areas that we've said that we'd like to really take the future of the Company. In addition to that, if you think about it geographically, we have huge opportunities, so outside of the America's market to really round out the business portfolio and participate, as we mentioned, like in China and some of these very large market that have been historically close to us.  We have those kinds of opportunities in Asia sell. We have some of those opportunities that still remains in Europe. So there will be some geographic place where we will actually do things to augment, supplement the portfolio as a way of participating in markets that we have historically essentially not played in as fully as we do, let's say, in the North America market.  I think you're going to find that it is a pretty wide set of opportunities that we have to continue to look at ways of growing the Company through M&A in our Electrical business based upon these broader strategic platforms as well as the geographic expansion and filling some of these product gaps and some of these other emerging markets of the world.  The other question that you had with respect to the Global business and why the increase in the guide. I say one, you just think about on a relative basis, the Global markets fell more than the America's business. And so the com is a little easier there. But also in some of these global markets with specifically in Europe, for example, they are now coming back.  The reopening of these markets is also coming into the business at a time when once again, the markets are ramping. And so the same kind of reopening phenomenon that took place in the U.S. off of a higher base because they didn't close as much, is now starting to take place in markets across Europe.  And as I said, it's every place. That means it's not just in these historical hot segments of Datacenters and residential but we're seeing it in commercial and institutional, we're seeing it in Industrial, we're seeing it in utility.  There really is a broad set of end markets that are really responding nicely in Europe and quite frankly in Asia as well as the economies continued open underlying growth in Asia and underlying growth in the European pieces that make up the Global business, those markets I said both performed very well.  This is the one segment that if you recall that we report inside a Global that tend to be, will be more of a later cycle play will be what's happening in [Indiscernible] business, which is the place where we really get most of our oil and gas exposure.  That market is starting to see a number of [Indiscernible] though certainly not back to levels that it was at historically. But we think second half of this year and into '22, that market also starts to come back and should help continue to drive growth in the Global segment and so it's really a broad range of these end markets, most of which that are doing well right now. David Raso : Obviously, it's pretty broad, but maybe you can help us with just some numbers update as geographically the current mix. And I assume Crouse-Hinds rate, that's within the industrial piece within Electrical Global. If you can remind us roughly [Indiscernible] nowadays? Craig Arnold : Yes. Maybe we can take a normal offline, David, where you can talk to Yan Jin about what we've given historically in terms of that business. Just want to make sure we were consistent with what we provided historically in terms of splitting out the global segment. And so we don't end up with a selected disclosure issue So. David Raso : Yeah. That's fine. Thank you very much. I appreciate the time. Craig Arnold : Thank you. Operator : Next we go to John Walsh with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. John Walsh : Hi. Good morning, everyone. Craig Arnold : Good morning. John Walsh : Wanted to build upon a couple of earlier questions. I appreciate the price cost commentary for the balance of the year, but just wondering as you look across your portfolio and as we think about incremental next year, where you think price will be most sticky, and maybe you could just remind us the historical experience coming off of the last deflationary cycle I think under the prior segment's products held a little bit more price in the system's business, but any color there would be helpful. Craig Arnold : I appreciate the question on price cost and it's many ways we're all working through this period of unprecedented commodity inflation in learning together in terms of where it's actually going to land.  As I said earlier, we anticipated that we would have seen the worst of it in Q2, and it looks like a lot of those pressure points have been pushed out to Q3 into the second half of the year. And it's once again, I think as a general rule, we talked about being neutral between pricing costs and I don't think there's any reason to suggest that that won't be the case, that price costs will continue to be neutral.  It does, as you can imagine, put a little pressure on our incremental as well, as you don't typically get a normal incremental on commodity inflation. And so in terms of how it impacts incremental, it obviously puts downward pressure on incremental.  But having said that, we still think 30% from a planning perspective is the right way to think about incremental for the Company. On price stickiness, I'd say that typically speaking, if you're in an inflationary environment and commodity costs are up, the price is going to be sticky. And so in this kind of environment, it's never easy to get price, but I'd say in this kind of environment, it's very understandable that prices are going to go up, it's very well-publicized, everybody's dealing with the same challenges, and so I would imagine that price will be very, very sticky in this environment given the supply shortages across the board, the fact that markets are doing well, really today like they're almost across the board, and so it's never easy, but this is probably one of the easiest times, at least in my professional career to actually pass on price because essentially the environmental factors are essentially warranting it.  We're seeing labor inflation as well, and so all of these things bode well for at least the price environment and the adjusting prices will likely be sticking through this part of the cycle for sometime to come. John Walsh : Great. And maybe just a follow-up to that. A lot of color given about geographies in the last question but, we've seen very strong organic growth from a lot of your competitors as well. Was just curious if you're noticing any discernable share shifts that you would call out, or if it's more kind of the strength of the market or do you think there might be some pockets where you are gaining share? Thank you. Craig Arnold : Yes. I'd say that if you think about it today, I'd say largely we think shares are pretty much holding across-the-board. It's always going to be quarterly timing, depending upon what companies do and various end markets and segments or the geographic mix, but I would suggest to you that probably at this point in time, given the fact that so many of us are dealing with supply chain challenges and there's probably more business out there than any of us can handle.  And we are building pretty large backlog s and probably other companies are, as well. My speculation would be that this is probably not large share changes taking place at this point in the market. So we're probably holding market share and it turned into in terms of our core businesses.  And we would imagine that really until you get to the point where you actually have enough capacity to serve the underlying demand overall, and you stop building backlog that share shift it's probably not going to be something that's a big part of the picture, at least in the near-term. John Walsh : Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Operator : Next, we'll go to Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Please go ahead. Julian Mitchell : Hi. Good morning. I just wanted to ask about cash flow. Is there anything that's been touched on yet? I saw the free cash flow guide went up, but if I look at the year's numbers in aggregate, it looks like you're guiding for about an 11% free cash flow margin this year and the adjusted sort of conversion from net income is maybe in the mid or low 80% range.  So, just wondering if you could sort of remind us what are some of those major headwinds on the free cash flow margin and/or conversion at present and if there are any specific items, maybe CapEx coming down next year or working capital headwinds easing when we're thinking about cash flow margins and conversion into 2022? Craig Arnold : Julian, if you, if you look at last year, we finished the year at 2.6 billion in free cash flow, which was considered a strong year. This year we characterize it as a transitory year. Having said that, we're going to spend roughly 200 million more in FX this year which takes us down to before, we've compares to the midpoint of our guide of 2.2 billion.  I'd put that additional 200 million in investments in working capital and given the environment that we're in. But probably as you think about '22 and beyond, I mean, being above 100% on free cash flow conversion is certainly where you'd expect the Company to perform.  And as Tom (ph) mentioned, this is really a transition year do the inventory build and increase in restructuring spending, increase also in CapEx. I think it's also important to note on an operating cash flow basis year-to-date, we're a little bit ahead of last year, so we feel good about our cash flow performance this year. Julian Mitchell : Thanks for clarifying. And then on the topline side, just wanted to try and understand what you're seeing in the utility markets at the moment. There is a lot of chatter out there any time there's a stall more something about grid hardening and all the rest of it.  I just wondered if you could give us an update on the utility piece and how the utility market growth looks this year relative to your overall sort of Electrical revenue growth guidance, which I think sort of average out globally in the low teens type range. Thank you. Craig Arnold : I appreciate the question on the utility market because as we've said before, this is a very different market segment in terms of what it represents for Eaton and what it represents for growth than it has historically.  And historically, a market that's really been kind of a very low single-digit growth market, we think as we look into the future for the utility market, we think it becomes one of the faster growing segments inside of the Company, and so maybe that growth is mid-single-digits in the near term and as you think about some of the big investments that have to go into energy transition first, which is obviously a really big one, and then that obviously involve things like grid hardening and grid resiliency due to climate change, and some of the weather-related events that we've seen. And so we like the utility market and we think that that market will certainly be a growth market into the future. I will say that we've not yet seen, once again, these big inflection points that we would expect to see in the utility market. We think most of that growth is still out in front of us.  As those markets, as you know, they tend to move more slowly. We have over the last number of years seeing more investments going into the distribution side of utility, which certainly plays to our strength. But the bigger plays that we think around grid harrowing, good resilience, energy transition.  The things that utilities are going to have to make fairly sizable investments in. We think most of that growth is set out in front of us. Julian Mitchell : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our final question will be from Ann Duignan with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Ann Duignan : Yes. Thank you. Appreciate just squeezing me. Most of my questions have been answered, but maybe Craig had similar question on data center, demand, and how we saw progress to the quarter just from an orders perspective, maybe versus start of the year and then maybe regionally also what you're seeing going on in data center demand. Thank you, and I'll leave it there. Craig Arnold : Yes, thanks and I appreciate the question. And is it it's obviously one of the most exciting segments that we're in. And certainly the acquisition of a Company like Tripp Lite just strengthens our hand there in terms of what data centers represents for the Company overall. And I'd say it's the one market I'd say that we have very clearly for some time now seen global strength, which you see it in every region of the world, and we see it across, really, almost every segment of datacenters, whether that's the on-prem, whether it's the call to operators, whether it's the hyperscale data center market, just continues to surprise to the upside.  And as we've said before, that those markets that can be lumpy. There could be a quarter or two, or even a year or so where a particular hyperscale player will take the time to consolidate and not expand. And so the business can be lumpy at least specifically in hyperscale.  But the projections for that market and what we've experienced is that it continues to surprise on the upside with respect to growth. I think this year we're talking about high-teens growth in the data center market.  And I said, as we've looked at that market, we've looked at our own forecast for that market. It's a big piece of what's performing better than what we originally anticipated when we put our guidance out for the year.  And once again, this whole idea of more data, more storage, more compute, the world's more connected, and so, we think if there is a trend that's going to continue for a very long time into the future. Yan Jin : Okay, good. Thanks, guys. As always, Chip and I will be a available to do any follow-up questions. Thank you for joining us. Have a good day. Craig Arnold : Alright. Thank you. Yan Jin : Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen. That does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Later we will conduct the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Yan Jin. Please go ahead. Yan Jin : Good morning, guys. I'm Yan Jin, Eaton Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you all for joining us for Eaton's Third Quarter 2021 Earning Call. With me today are Craig Arnold, our Chairman and CEO, and Tom Okray, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our agenda today includes opening remarks by Craig, highlighting the Company's performance in the third quarter. As we have done our past calls, we'll be taking questions at the end of the Craig 's comments. The price release and presentation we will go through today have been posted on our website @www. eaton.com.  This presentation, including the adjusted earnings per share, adjusted and free cash flow, and other non - GAAP measures. There are recon sales in the appendix. An EV cost of this call is accessible on our website and it will be available for replay. I would like to remind you that our comments today will including statements related to the expected future results of the Company and are therefore forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our projected future due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and presentation. With that, I will turn it over to Craig. Craig Arnold : Okay. Thank you. It will start on page 3 with highlights for the quarter, and by noting that our team delivered record results in Q3, despite the well-publicized supply chain challenges in this environment, we had strong execution across all of our businesses. And as we focused on controlling what we could control. And as you can see, we posted an all-time record for adjusted EPS of $1.75. Supply chain constraint did have an impact on our revenue, but we still posted 8% growth in the quarter. And for the third quarter in a row, we delivered record segment margins at 19.9% in Q3. It was an all-time record and an increase of 230 basis points over prior year.  On top of record margin is our -- we're also pleased with our incremental margins, which were 46% in the quarter due to actions that we took to mitigate inflationary cost, the portfolio changes that we'd have undertaken, and savings from restructuring programs. We did have a bit of help from favorable mix as well in the quarter. And while revenues were lighter than expected in our Electrical America segment, we're very pleased to see the strength in orders in the growing backlog. Overall demand rein, remains very strong. For the electrical businesses overall, orders were up 17% rolling 12-month basis and our backlog was up more than 50%, another all-time record. Next on Page 4, we summarize our Q3 results and I'll note just a few points here.  First, our 9% revenue growth, we increased our operating profits by 23%, which reflects strong operating leverage and benefits from our portfolio actions. Second, our acquisitions increased revenues by 7%, which was fully offset by the sale of hydraulics. We're naturally pleased to have replaced the hydraulic revenue with a collection of businesses that are I'd say higher growth, higher margin, and have more earnings consistency. And last, our margins of 19.9% were well above our guidance range of 19 to 19.4 as our team did an outstanding job of executing, despite the lower-than-expected revenues. Moving to page 5, we have the results of our Electrical America n segment.  Revenues were up 9%, including 1% organic and 8% from the acquisition of Tripp Lite. Organic sales growth was driven by strength in data centers and residential markets, partially offset by weakness in large industrial projects and sales to utilities. As I mentioned earlier, revenues were impacted by supply chain constraints. Our Electrical America segments separate from the general supply chain constraints that we're all feeling. but was actually disproportionately impacted by a few unique suppliers who were especially impactful to this business. We're naturally addressing these and other supply challenges and expect to do better in Q4. Operating margins continued to be strong at 21.7%, and were up 40 basis points from Q2. This is consistent with our expectations and we're doing a good job of getting price to offset inflation. I'd say the biggest highlight in this segment is to continued growth in orders and in backlog. On a rolling 12-month basis, orders were up 17% organically and this was an acceleration from up 13% in Q2. The strongest segments were utility and residential markets. And the backlog is up more than 50% from last year and up 9% from Q2. Both I'd say are encouraging signs in support to our expectations that the mis shipments will simply be pushed into future quarters.  Turning to page 6, we summarize our electrical global segments results, which I'd say were just strong across the board. Organic growth was 18% with broad strength in really all end markets and currency added 1%. We also posted all-time record operating margins of 20.1% and had very strong incremental margins of nearly 40%. The margin performance was driven by volume leverage, strong cost control, and savings, once again, from restructuring actions. Orders were very strong, up 17% organically on a rolling 12-month basis, with particular strength in the quarter in industrial, commercial, and institutional markets. Like our America segment, the backlog is up more than 50% and at record levels.  Before we move to the industrial businesses, here's the way I'd summarize the performance of our electrical businesses. When you add the two together, they delivered solid organic growth of 8%, built a sizable backlog, which strengthens our outlook for future quarters and improved margins by a 110 basis points. So on balance, I'd say a very strong set of quarterly results for our electrical businesses. Moving to page 7, we have the financial results of our aerospace segment. Revenues were up 38%, 4% organic, and 33% from the acquisition of Cobham Mission Systems, and 1% from currency. Organic growth was primarily due to higher sales in commercial markets, partially offset by weakness in military markets. Operating margins were 22% up 350 basis points from last year, and 100 basis points sequentially. This strong performance gives us confidence that as aerospace markets continue to recover, we'll meet or exceed the 24% margin targets that have been set for this segment. In the quarter, we also had strong organic incremental margins which were driven by favorable mix primarily from the growth of commercial aftermarket business. And as a result, once again, from savings from the restructuring actions that we've taken. And by the way, Q3 was the first full quarter where Cobham Mission Systems, were part of the Company. And we're very pleased with the financial performance of the business and the integration process is going very smoothly. As we look to the future, we're seeing encouraging signs of recovery in this segment with both orders and backlog now trending positively. On a rolling 12-month basis, orders were up 4% primarily with strength in the business jet segment and our backlog has increased by 5%. Next, on page 8, we have result of our vehicle segment. Organic revenues increased 11% with solid growth in North America class 8 truck business and strength in South America that more than offset the weakness in North America like vehicle markets. And as you're all well aware of light vehicle production, it has been severely impacted by supply chain constraints. Operating margins were 18% and we generated very strong incremental margins of more than 50%. In addition to strong execution, we also had some favorable mix in the quarter, specifically and of North America, the truck business benefited from strong aftermarket, where sales were up some 40% at attractive aftermarket margins. And our North America light vehicle motor vehicle business also benefited from favorable mix as customers, prior borrower ties programs with more of our content, more full-size pickups and SUVs -- SUVs and fewer small cars. So good mix, good volume growth and savings from the multiyear. restructuring program all contributed to very strong quarterly operating results here. Turning to page 9, you will see the financial results of our eMobility segment, where revenues increased 6% organically. Like our vehicle business, customer production levels will reduce by supply chain constraints here as well. And given the nature of the products that we sell in this segment, that they were more significantly impacted by the semiconductor shortages that we've all read about. As a result, our backlog is up significantly here. Operating margins were a negative 9.5%, once again, due to heavy IRD investments and startup costs associated with new programs. We continue to be pleased with the progress in this business, which has one programs worth nearly $600 million of mature year revenue. And we expect to see a significant ramp up in revenues in 2023, which positions us well to achieve our long-term revenue targets of $2 to $4 billion by 2030.  On page 10, we provide an update at our organic growth and operating margins for the year. With supply chain constraints in Q3 continuing into Q4, we now expect overall organic revenue growth of 9% to 11% for 2021. For Electrical America we expect 5% to 7% growth. You'll note the implied guidance for Q4 is actually 7% to 9%, which is a solid step up from the 1% in Q3. Organic revenues in aerospace are expected to be roughly flat with strength in commercial markets being offset by weakness in military markets. And the other segments had some minor reductions in revenue as well, but just minor. Despite slightly lower organic revenue growth outlook, we're increasing our operating margin guard guidance by 20 basis points, from 18.6% to 19%.  And I'd note that, with this guidance we're on track to generate strong incremental margins of approximately 40% for 2021, which we see naturally is outstanding performance given the current inflationary environment. Moving to page 11, we have the remaining items of our guidance for the year. We expect full-year adjusted EPS between $6.69 to $60.69. At the midpoint, this represents 35% growth over 2020. We're also delivering significant margin improvement up 240 basis points from last year at the midpoint of our increased margin guidance. I'm pleased as we have strong operating performance in the face of what we call historic supply chain challenges. And the businesses are doing well. Next, given more active M&A activities, we now expect share repurchase to be between $375 million and $425 million.  And lastly, our Q4 guidance includes earnings between $1.6 and $1.78, organic revenue growth between 7% and 9%, and segment margins between 18.8% and 19.2%, an increase of 160 basis points at the midpoint versus prior year. Overall, once again, a strong 2021 with solid revenue growth, strong orders and good execution, allowing us to deliver record margins. Next on page 12, we did want to provide some preliminary assumptions for our end-market for 2022. And as you can see, that we're expecting attractive growth in nearly all of our markets, with very good growth and data-centers and elect -- industrial facilities, and in our electrical business, and in our commercial aerospace business.  And certainly in all vehicle markets. We'll provide more detailed color on organic revenue growth assumptions when we provide our 2022 guidance in February. But we did want to share some of our preliminary thinking here. We would also expect to see carryover benefits from pricing actions taken, which should also help our year-over-year growth next year. And lastly on page 13, we provide just some summary thoughts here and I'd say, first I'm proud of the record quarter results, and particularly our strong margin performance. Our team has demonstrated that, we can manage through a challenging operating environment, supply chain constraint, inflationary pressures, and still improve margins and EPS.  And the long-term secular growth trends of electrification, energy transition, and digitalization are playing out just as we expected, or maybe even better. We also see 2021 as a transformative year for Eaton in terms of Portfolio Management. We're higher-growth, higher-margin, and less cyclical Company today. And with strong year-to-date performance, we're well on our track to deliver very strong 2021 with double-digit organic revenue growth, and 35% adjusted EPS growth. And I'd also add, we have great momentum going into the Q4 and into next year. We have strong order growth, we have a full backlog, and many of our end markets are poised for recovery.  And you'll recall that at the beginning of the year, we said medium-term targets of 4 to 6% organic revenue growth annually, 400 to 500 basis points improvement in margins, and 11 to 13% annual growth in adjusted EPS. And so evaluating our progress about 1-year in, I'd say that we're running ahead of expectations. And with that summary, I'm pleased to turn it back over to Yan and to open the session up for Q&A. Yan Jin : Okay, great. Thanks, Craig. For the Q&A section today, please limit your question to one question and one follow-up. Thanks everyone for your corporation. With that, I will turn it over to the operator to give you the instructions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie, with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Joe Ritchie : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Craig Arnold : Good morning, Joe. Joe Ritchie : Craig, I know you want to give us some commentary or way to give us exact commentary on 2022 organic growth expectations in February. I guess, this -- in the context of the long-term framework of 4 to 6 and with your backlog in the Electrical business being up 30%,. I mean, is it fair to assume that, just the Electrical business should be at a very minimum, at the 4% to 6% range for next year, or maybe slightly better just given what you are seeing across our business? Craig Arnold : I appreciate the question, Joe. And certainly, if you take a look at the performance of the business this year and the backlog that we're building in 17% order intake, you can certainly make a case for that business performing better than the 4% to 6% numbers that we laid out. And you'll also recall by the way as we laid up those targets for growth for the Company, that the businesses are all running towards higher growth numbers. And we hedge those numbers back at the corporate level, recognizing that things happen in the world that you don't often anticipate and expect.  I mean, Q3 is a great example of that with some of these supply chain constraints and there's always a number of uncertainties out there. And so I think, yes, there's certainly a possibility that the electrical segments could perform better than that. And we have internal plans that would suggest better performance in that. But once again, given the number of uncertainties that we're dealing with, especially in today's supply chain environment, we still think for planning purposes, those are still reasonable assumptions to make. But you could be upright. Joe Ritchie : That's fair. And I guess maybe just following up there in just talking about pricing, Obviously, key topic the conversation across the conference call this far. And as you think about your own pricing mechanisms and how this plays out for you in 2022, maybe talk a little bit about how much prices we can expect to come through the system. Thank you. Craig Arnold : Pricing as we talked about a little bit at the Laguna Conferences as well. And we our expectation continues to be that our businesses will fully offset inflation with price. We are living in an environment today where I'd say it's never easy to get price, but it's probably easier today given some of the supply chain constraints that we're all dealing with and it's probably evident, certainly in my professional career and so I'd say that our thinking really hasn't changed with respect to pricing. We have good mechanisms in place. Our pricing typically lags inflation by a quarter or 2 depending upon which segment of the market we're serving.  We naturally have experienced more inflation as we came through Q3 than we originally anticipated. And as a result, we like others, have had to go to the market for additional price. But by and large, this pattern continues and we would expect that. As we look forward to 2022, we would expect to once again, more than fully offset the inflationary pressure that we experienced this year. And maybe it's going to add a little bit of a tailwind next year. By and large, our long-term expectation on price versus inflation is to fully offset it. And that's what we're tracking to for this year. Operator : Thank, you. Our next question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Andrew Obin : Good morning. Yan Jin : Good morning. Andrew Obin : Just to build on Joe's question. How much supply chain challenge impact your revenue in the third quarter, particularly in North America? I think you alluded to it, but if you could care to quantify it. Craig Arnold : Yeah. I appreciate the question, Joe. Certainly if you take a look at on balance our electrical business grew some 8% in the quarter. We combined t; but very different performance in our Electrical Global versus the Americas business, which is where we had clearly our biggest supply chain constraints. And I'd mentioned in my opening commentary, we have a number of unique suppliers in that business that really resulted in revenues being below what we anticipated. And so as we think about it and you try to quantify the impact in the quarter. Our backlog grew in the quarter by $280 million.  If you look at the shippable piece of that piece that -- in the quarter, we could say its order magnitude, something north of $100 million, let's call it $130 million of revenue, if you simply look at the shippable back log in the quarter itself. So we could have very easily posted, I would say, a 9% growth number in the Electrical America business in the quarter but for the supply chain constraints. Andrew Obin : Wow, thank you. And then just how should we think about just backlog versus normal because we actually had a number of companies in our coverage that normally know for more of a short-cycle focus talked about backlog is up 40%, 50%, 30%. As you guys think about the world, does it mean, more visibility or actually more uncertainty? Because of so unusual for our business like yours to care so much in terms of backlog. How do you guys think about it internally? Thank you. Craig Arnold : We clearly see that it has more visibility. If you think about in a typical year, we would go into, let's say, the year with 25% to 35% of our orders for the upcoming year in the backlog. And we're certainly running today at the very high end of that. And so we clearly see it as a better visibility. We test that, you can imagine the quality of the backlog and whether or not the backlog is solid in terms of these orders. And we're testing our customers and channel partners and the indication that we're getting, although you never a 100% certain there probably is a little bit of order play so that's second place and get your position in line. But by and large, the backlog field is extremely solid. Andrew Obin : Thanks so much, Craig. Craig Arnold : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Please go ahead. Jeff Sprague : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Craig Arnold : Good morning. Jeff Sprague : Morning. Just back on the supply chain, Craig, the 1% growth really does jump out, right relative to Hobo and then Schneider really everyone else. And I just wonder if you could elaborate a little bit more on what the issues were in the quarter, and just your confidence level that they're resolved. Just think as the market leader in the U.S., if anybody could get the stuff, it would be you and that didn't seem to happen in the quarter. Craig Arnold : I appreciate the question, Jeff. And we are a market leader in North America. And as you know, our North America electrical business has really posted probably 10 years in a role of share gain. And so we do have a very strong position in the market. And we have great supplier relationships in general. I'd say that in our case, what was a little bit unique is that they were a few suppliers that we have that support our Electrical America business. Who were surprised that we have that are perhaps not suppliers to others in the industry that had some challenges that we're working through together. And so as I talked about, if you see it in the growth in the backlog, what sales easily been.  But for the supply chain challenges, I think that number 1 becomes a 9% number, which I think you'd agree is much more in line with what you've seen from some of the others in the industry. And so we're absolutely confident that it's timing. It -- It's tied is very specific supplier issues that we're clearly focused on and working. We generally speaking like that, have very supportive and strong supplier relationships and it's not about one of our competitors being over-allocated and us being under-allocated. These are just suppliers that are unique to our business, that are working through some particular issues in their own kind of operations that they need to be worked through.  And so yes, I'd say by and large, it's timing. We'll get through this and we're talking about growth numbers of around 8% or so in Q4, and we're setting up well for 2022. And you could see it in our Electrical global business, they grew 18% in the quarter. And so I think that, I don't want to aggregate when you look at our global Electrical business, our growth is very much in line with others in the industry, and we would've been better. But for the supply chain issues that we're having in North America. So the franchise is in good shape, nothing to worry about. We really just see it as timing. Jeff Sprague : Great. Thanks for that caller. And then just on price, I think you've been a little reluctant to be specific on price, but I would assume you're in the same zip code is what we're seeing out there. Mid, even high type single-digit price increases. Is that that kind of directionally correct? And I don't know -- could you just maybe share just a little bit more thought on what the wrap around price impact might be in 2022? Craig Arnold : Okay. And I appreciate the question on price and why you asked for more transparency on it. It varies widely by customers in different markets that we're in and so we're not going to provide more transparency than we provided other than say that we're getting price to offset inflation. We'll be about neutral this year. We think it will be slightly positive next year. But beyond that, we'd rather not comment on price as it -- obviously you have lots of different customers to have different end markets, you have different supply chain factors affecting different parts of the business, and so, overall, our teams are doing well, we're getting price to offset inflation and there will be a net neutral this year, maybe a net positive next year. Yan Jin : We will clearly have a wrap impact as you mentioned, Jeff, just given the timing of the execution of the pricing in 2021. Jeff Sprague : Thanks. I'll leave it there. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nicole Deblase with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Nicole Deblase : Yeah. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Craig Arnold : Good morning, Nicole. Nicole Deblase : Just to take you back on Jeff's question. I guess, you guys are embedding like a snap back in Electrical America in 4Q. So like as you progressed through the beginning of the fourth quarter, have you seen some of those supply-chain issues go away just to give us some confidence about the achievability of getting back to 79% organic? Craig Arnold : Appreciate the question, Nicole, and obviously as a part of providing guidance externally, we were looking at our internal forecasts from our operations. We're obviously been in a number of very direct conversations with suppliers who have made commitments to us and our improvements. And so, you can rest assured that that forecast is very much grounded in what we're hearing from our suppliers and what we're getting specifically from our businesses in terms of their expectations. And so, we're confident in that forecast based upon what we're hearing from our suppliers. We're not -- Nicole Deblase : Got it. Thanks. Craig Arnold : Let's say we're not completely out of the woods, we still have some challenges. Once again, Q4 could be better if we were completely resolved from some of the slight change. We're not assuming that all of the problems are resolved in Q4, but certainly much better than in Q3. Nicole Deblase : Okay, I got it. And then just maybe to follow up on that thinking about how you guys took positioned margins for the fourth quarter, you do have a bit of a step-down coming from these record levels in the third quarter, is that just some of this favorable mix dynamics that you experienced in 3Q. Are you assuming that that goes away just trying to understand the puts and takes because think normally for the seasonal perspective, margins would be more like flattish Q-on-Q. Craig Arnold : We did as I mentioned in my commentary, we had some favorable mix in Q3 for sure. And when we have a little bit of unfavorable mix in Q4. A lot of these big projects that essentially have been built in the backlog as we grow in the backlog during the course of the year, are expected to be shipped in Q4 and a lot of these big projects is carry slightly lower margins than the components business. So I'd say it's really, once again, nothing to worry about it's really just a function of mix in the quarter. Nicole Deblase : Thanks, Craig. I'll pass it on. Craig Arnold : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski, with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Josh Pokrzywinski : Hi. Good morning, guys. Craig Arnold : Good morning, Josh. Josh Pokrzywinski : Could I just -- I guess everyone is standing on everyone else's shoulders for questions this morning. So I think I'm on Joe Ritchie for this one. But on the backlog commentary, I mean, if I'm kind of following the pattern versus last year, you guys look like you're going to end the year up, at the corporate level, maybe $4 billion or maybe $5 billion on backlog. I guess, first question, does that 2022 Q kind of preliminary color that's market demand and then anything on price and backlog consumption, sort of incremental? And then follow on to that, In other kind of cyclical environments, what would you view it's kind of the bandwidth to be able to convert backlog in any given year, because that's something that is kind of natural, we stage gated by throughput even without supply chain constraints. Thanks. Craig Arnold : I appreciate your question. I will tell you that as we think about the market outlook in our economic forecast. The economic forecasts of markets will generally include price. So price would be baked in, you can debate whether it should be more or less than, than what we're assuming, but it should be generally baked in. Backlog reduction it's clearly something that we're trying to think through right now as we develop our plan for next year and we -- it's too early to make a call and give you specific guidance around, what our assumptions are around burning down backlog and getting to more of an historical level.  A lot of that will be highly dependent upon the supply chain environment and how that unfolds during the course of Q4 and into the first part of next year. I will say that, as we think about the supply chain challenges in general, we think we'll probably be dealing with supply chain challenges through the first half of next year. And if you think about semiconductors or some of the electronic components we think it's -- maybe it's more like a 2023, before those issues become fully resolved. And so we'll give you more guidance in February when we lay out our plan for the year. But at this juncture, we're not -- in those market outlooks, it does not necessarily assume burned down in backlog, but it would include price. Josh Pokrzywinski : Helpful, appreciate it. Good luck, guys. Craig Arnold : Yes, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Davis Melius Research, please go ahead. Scott Davis : Good morning, everybody. Craig Arnold : Morning. Scott Davis : Is there -- other customer segments that you're selling into that you're concerned about double ordering or folks just perhaps taking product that they don't need right now and given the shortages that are out there in general? Craig Arnold : No. I appreciate that question, Scott Davis it's one that we spent a lot of time pushing on, thinking about as well because when you are dealing with backlog that these levels that's a natural concern. As I mentioned in my commentary earlier, as we tested this specifically with our customers and where you would typically would find it is largely in the distribution channel. And today I'd say that distributors, they want more inventory; they would take more inventory if we could ship it to them and their inventory levels are in actually reasonably good shape and lower than they'd like them to be, certainly in a number of end markets. And so we can't be completely certain and it would be reasonable to assume that there is a little bit of double ordering going on. But I can tell you as we talk to our customers, it's tough to find it. Scott Davis : Okay. That's helpful. And then for Tom, this new minimum tax treaty / compromise or whatever that's been talked about in the press. I know the fine details aren't probably there yet on how to enforce it, but is there any sense of how that impacts Eaton on overall tax rate? Yan Jin : No, I appreciate the questions, Scott. Obviously, we're following it very closely, very well connected with what's going on. What I would caution you on is, you look at the headlines and the devil is really in the detail in terms of what the tax code is going to be. The Legislation that's going to get passed, etc. What I can leave you with is we're very confident relative to our peers that we will maintain our relative advantage and strong position as it relates to tax. But more to come on it for sure. Scott Davis : Okay. Good. I'll pass it on. Thank you. Good luck, guys. Craig Arnold : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ann Duignan with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Ann Duignan : Yeah. Hi. Thank you. Perhaps we can turn to 2022 and your outlook by end markets. I appreciate the color, but it is funny to see no red arrows at all across any of your sectors. If you could just talk about where the risks might align for a market that could potentially be down. I would think maybe military aerospace. And then residential, you have a flat and yet I think you called it out Craig, as orders in residential were very strong. So if you could just reconcile that, maybe this page reflects Global and you were talking about North America. But if you could just talk through some of those end market assumptions that would be helpful. Thank you. Craig Arnold : Thanks Ann. Appreciate the question and I -- to your -- to your opening commentary, it is an unusual year where you have all of your end markets that you're expecting to see some growth in and so we're feeling very good about next year as a result of that. And I'd say that if you think about specifically whether its residential markets, orders are strong. If you look at some of the macro indicators around whether it's housing stats or the affordability index of housing, there are some macro indicators that would suggest that these markets should naturally slowdown. That you can't keep posting these huge double-digit growth numbers for an indefinite period of time.  And so I'd say it's really more the macro indicators that we're looking at in residential that would have us suggesting that the market is flatish in 2022. Not at all consistent with the order growth that we're seeing today, which continues to be strong and not all consistent with the back-order growth in the back log -- in the back-order growth is also quite strong in residential.. And so we'll have to see how it plays out. But certainly at some point that market will slow down. And that's what's reflected in kind of that outlook for the year. And I'd say in general, the data centers continue to be extraordinarily strong, and there's no reason for that would suggest that data centers would in any way backup.  And so, we're comfortable with the data center forecasts around the world. As people continue to consume, process, and store increasing amounts of data. Utility markets -- we think utility markets are poised for growth, as well as they continue to invest in grid hardening and weather hardening and all these events that we're seeing around the world. Weather-related events that will continue to drive investments in utility markets. If you think about today, what's going on today in the industrial markets as we all deal with these labor shortages around the world, there is certainly going to be an increased appetite we believe for investing in automation and factories and equipment.  And so can you give -- we talk about these broader trends around energy transition and investments in the electric vehicle charging infrastructure to support all these electric vehicles that are going to ultimately be produced and sold around the world and so I think we are in this little bit of a cover of Goldilocks period with respect to a number of our end markets that most of the indicators are pointing positive as we think about the future. Global vehicle market, we thinking about the challenges that they've experienced this year and all the demand that was unmet. I mean, that's another market that's just well position to grow next year and commercial aerospace will come back.  Military markets, should we say, what could go wrong? What you're worried about? We continue to be worried about supply chain constraint that still a bit of an unknown and uncertain. We worry a little bit about what's happening in Washington. But by and large, we think that's net positive in terms of these infrastructure bills that once again having been baked into our thinking in terms of whether or not we get these big infrastructure spending bills that will come out, that will certainly support many of our end markets. And so we can certainly talk ourselves into maybe a scenario that's less optimistic. But by and large, looking at the macro indicators and how our Company's position, we feel very good about not just '22, but really the medium-term outlook. Ann Duignan : Thank you for the clarity and Craig, just a follow-up to that, do you worry at all? I mean, if you're right about this outlook, and additionally, automotive production comes back strongly. Is there any risk that we just exacerbate the supply chain problem, because we haven't really sorted that out. Particularly, if we get the semiconductor issue sorted, and that's suddenly there are plenty of chips available. But we haven't sorted out the labor and the freight and all the rest. Is there any risk to next year's revenues as supply chain issues continue for longer than anticipated, that's something that you talk about internally and I'll leave it there. Thank you. Craig Arnold : Okay. No, it's absolutely -- we -- as you can imagine, we're spending an extraordinary amount of time right now talking exactly about that issue in terms of all the potential supply chain bottlenecks. Not only the bottlenecks today, but what becomes the bottleneck tomorrow, when you resolve this bottleneck and it is -- has been today a little bit of -- we're playing whack-a-mole because there have been a number of unforeseen supply chain challenges that have popped up, whether relates to raw materials or whether it relates to labor availability. As you've all read about in the newspaper, as we all challenge to fill open jobs in our production operations. And so I think that risk is out there. I think the risk is out there, but I think will it be worse than in 2021? I don't think so. I think 2022 will be a better year than 2021. How much better? You could debate based upon the rate at which the industry is able to resolve some of these supply chain constraints. Ann Duignan : Thank you [Indiscernible] Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mig Dobre with Baird, please go ahead. Mig Dobre : Thank you and good morning. Craig Arnold : Morning. Mig Dobre : I'm just looking for maybe a little more perspective on the various items on a cost structure that you had to adjust in the back half of this year when you obviously cut 200 basis points from your top-line. But you raised your margin outlook. So you mentioned [indiscernible] helped you in the third quarter. I'm wondering if there are other puts and takes here in terms of what allowed for this, obviously very good margin performance that we need to be aware of. Craig Arnold : I'd say that other than the things make that we've laid out, the one that was probably outside of our control kind of the good guy that we got was on the mix front. We're obviously on the billing dealing with a lot of other, I'd say extraordinary costs that we would normally not have in the business around. The money we're spending to expedite materials and labor inefficiencies in our factories, and so I think in any business there's always a balance of goods and bads, and we did call out mix as a positive.  But there's also, as I mentioned, a lot of other challenges that we're dealing with as we try to keep our factory, fully staffed, fully running and productive, given some of these supply chain constraints that we've had and so I know, I'd say that mostly it's just been good execution. Our teams, as you know, we called it relatively early, we anticipated that we're going to have a revenue issue due to supply chain, and our teams at that point went to work on the things that we can control, the things that we can do to maximize our performance and deliver our earnings despite the supply chain challenges. And so I think we've really just seeing good execution, the other place that we're seeing better benefits, quite frankly than we originally anticipated was in our restructuring programs. We're running ahead of schedule and some of the benefits associated with restructuring. You'll see in the queue that we filed that we've taken the spending up on restructuring by about $40 million and it's going deliver $30 million more benefits than we originally anticipated. And so our teams are really good, laser focused on executing, controlling the things that we don't -- we can't -- we can't control and then managing the things that we can't to the best of our ability. So I'd say it's just really good execution in the quarter and for the year it will be a very strong year. Mig Dobre : I see. But in terms of items like variable compensation or some other component of your expense structure is variable, nothing [Indiscernible] Craig Arnold : I mean, sure. Certainly, it's going to be a very good year. So the comp plan is higher than what we spend. Whatever originally planned for, which is good thing. So no, the comp plan is higher not lower. And we haven't offset that as well. Mig Dobre : Okay. Then my follow-up, I'm just looking to clarify in terms of the supply chain, are things getting less bad in the fourth quarter relative to the third, your supplier catching up and that's how you dig your way out of this hole as it were? Or are you doing some things proactively in terms of qualifying new suppliers, making adjustments to your supply chain, given all that transpired in 2021? Thank you. Craig Arnold : And I have to say it make it's really all of the above. And in many cases, some of the supplier constraints that we've had are getting better. We're also working hard to -- where we have the ability to change materials, qualify different materials. We're working on that, where we've had some labor constraints, whether it's in our own shops or with our suppliers, in some cases we're actually sending some of our people to supplier\u2019s operation sales may in their lines. So we're really -- it's a whole host of things that we're working on and really pulling every lever that's within our control to improve the supply chain situation. So not one thing, it's really a whole multitude of different initiatives that are being undertaken by our teams around the world to improve the outlook. Mig Dobre : Got it. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Please go ahead. Julian Mitchell : Hi. Good morning, maybe just a first question on the portfolio, which I don't think has been addressed yet in the Q&A. Intrigued that you took down the buyback guide, because of heightened M&A appetites, so maybe help us understand what's changing there. Is it just because it's such a buoyant M&A environment, you're seeing a lot more assets for sale coming to market than you'd expected, maybe 6 or 12 Julian Mitchell : months ago. And also, I suppose it tells us that you think valuations for M&A look reasonable. So maybe help us understand, has anything changed on your returns hurdles or is it just the volume of assets coming to market is what makes it so appealing. And also then on the divestment side, if you're getting more intrigued to do M&A, should we expect divestment's perhaps to also pick up again next year? Tom Okray : Thanks, Julian. I would not read too much into the level of buybacks that we've done year-to-date. It's about a $123 million. What I draw your attention to is the beginning of the year with the big acquisitions that we've done related to carbon as well as Tripp Lite. We're always on the lookout for very good quality strategic acquisitions, which these 2 have certainly proved to be, and therefore, we just took more of our capital dollars and put them back acquisitions as opposed to buybacks. So I wouldn't read anything into it in terms of capital allocation, strategy changes.  And as it relates to divestitures, as Craig has said many times, we're always on the lookout to grow the head and shrink the tail. So whether it's a part of our business, it's not performing, we're always going to look at pruning it and adding on the upside, but nothing specific to report here. Craig Arnold : And the only thing I would add to what Tom said, I completely agree with all that we have been more active this year than we anticipated. There are obviously the big headline deals of Cobham and Tripp Lite. But we've done a number of other deals during the course of the year as well. In our electrical business, JVs that we've signed in the China market, where we acquired a green motion business in Europe, and so we have been very active this year in M&A market. I'd say from a portfolio transformation, I think it's one of the most transformational in the history of the Company. And so we continue to be focused on opportunities. We are in fact seeing a better deal flow today than we certainly have in the last couple of years. Valuations in many cases are still stretched. What I would we'll commit to you and promises that we'll -- we'll remain disappointed. You've seen the kind of multiples that we're paying for acquisitions and the type of assets that we're acquiring and -- and we won't lose our way, we'll continue to be focused on those kind of assets, focusing in our electrical business, focusing in our eMobility segment, focusing in our aerospace business. But we are seeing a better deal flow today and given the trade-off between our value creating acquisition of highly strategic, and buying back shares, we're obviously, leaning in towards spending those M&A dollars to grow the portfolio. Julian Mitchell : That's reassuring. Thank you. And then maybe -- there's been a lot of questions on the revenue and EBITDA and so forth. Maybe just on the free cash flow. Year-to-date, your EPS is up, adjusted 40% the cash flow -- free cash flows down in the mid-teens. Realize there are some one time driving a wage between the 2 metrics? So when we look at 2022, should we expect conversions to be closer to 100%, maybe any initial thoughts on, does CapEx have more of a lead on it next year than this year. Any context around that free cash outlook from here? Craig Arnold : Wait. I think it's important Julian, to note that our -- in the quarter, our free cash flow conversion was approximately 100% and free cash flow as a percentage of net sales was 12.4%. Our midterm outlook, I think was 14%, so we're on that trajectory. As it relates to next year and going forward, we would certainly want to be at that 100% or higher our free cash flow conversion. And as it relates to CapEx, we're always going to have our first priority and our capital allocation to invest in growth in the business. So we'd be looking for those opportunities. Julian Mitchell : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Nigel Coe : Thank. Good morning. Craig Arnold : Good morning, Nigel? Nigel Coe : I just wanted to go back -- hi. Good morning. I just want to back to Electrical America. You did have a tough comp in the prior year with some inventory. We saw benefits from 3Q '20. So I'm curious, any comments on where inventories are trending right now when you channel them? I'm guessing, it wasn't helpful. And then just one more crack at the supply chain. You do have a pretty complex supply chain down in Puerto Rico and I think, Dominican Republic. I am just wondering if that was a factor behind some of these supply change nappies? Craig Arnold : Okay. On the latter question and I don't know, not at all. I mean, the -- we do have a number of our facilities in the Dominican Republic in Puerto Rico, and that was in no way related to the pricing challenges that we're dealing with. It really was a third-party supplier, is outside of our four walls where the issues were largely centered. And I missed this the first part of your question, Nigel. What was -- I missed the statement around the first part of your question, what was the first part of it? Nigel Coe : Yes, just -- you are comping some inventory restock benefits in the prior year. So just curious, what you're seeing in the inventories within channels this quarter. I'm guessing, it wasn't helpful, but income [indiscernible] Craig Arnold : Yeah, I'd say as we talked a little bit in the opening commentary, as we've done these channel checks and talk to our distributor partners and they would tell you today that own balance inventories are either in line with where they like them to be, or in many cases, below, where they like them to be. And unfortunately today, given some of the demand in the market and some of the supply chain challenges, we're probably disappointing more distributors than we certainly care to with our inability to ship due to supply chain constraints. And so total inventories at this juncture, I'd say by a merger are well in control and in many cases below where they need to be. Nigel Coe : Yes, that's what I expected. And then a quick follow-on with pension out. You got a $0.2 billion of pension obligations this year. We've seen some nice benefits from discount rates rising up see macro trends being positive. Just curious, the best view on pension funding for the next 2 or 3 years based on the current funding levels. Tom Okray : Yeah. Our pension, as you know is almost fully funded. We don't anticipate making any additional contributions to it. How the pension plays out in the next year, obviously, it's going to depend on the returns and the discount rates at the end of the year. And more to come on that specifically when we talk in February. Nigel Coe : Okay. Thanks Tom. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Raso with Evercore. Please go ahead. David Raso : Thank you. My question relates to incremental margins next year in Electrical, just trying to get some sense. When you look at your Slide 12, the end market assumptions, just from what you know about what's in the backlog and also how these businesses are structurally. When you look at that mix, is that a positive for incremental margins, neutral, negative, just trying to get a sense of how you think about those businesses. And of course what you know is in the backlog price cost, and everything else. Craig Arnold : I appreciate the question and I'd say that there is nothing specifically in the backlog that we think is going to drive any changes in terms of the incremental performance of our business going into 2022, as we kind of articulate in the past that you really want to think about, the Company is delivering about 30% incremental. We're obviously delivering a bit better than that this year. There's been a lot of great work done inside the business. We're getting some earlier benefits from restructuring. We are getting some benefits from the portfolio moves that we made this year. But I think for planning purposes, I think a 30% incremental is really the right way to think about the incremental store for the electrical business and really for the entire Company. David Raso : And also this month, Siemens, the way they price, they are playing a little catch-up. But you heard even low double-digit increases on the resi products, high-single for non - resi, seems like [indiscernible] at least 5% to 10%. It appears by the first quarter of next year versus the end of last year, pricing might be up as much as almost 20% in aggregate. I'm not hearing you, but I'm just curious, maybe I missed it, are you hearing any demand destruction at all with this pricing? Craig Arnold : No, we're really not hearing any demand destruction at all. And as I said it's been an extraordinary period of time where pricing is as seems to be seamlessly pass-through to the marketplace and the demand remained strong. I mean, to your point around incremental margins when clearly what we're dealing with in this environment we're hyperinflationary environment where you have really big pricing going into market, but you have big cost increases that you typically don't get. Your normal margins on the commodity increase, and so there has been this year and a little bit of pressure on margins and as a result of not recovering the full margin on the commodity cost increase. And so that is certainly something that's hold -- held margins back a bit. Tom Okray : Remember, it's not just commodities increasing, we're also seeing obviously, labor increases. We're seeing logistics increases and those are likely sticky. Somewhat going into 2022 as well, which gets you back to a 30% incremental for planning purposes. David Raso : Which is nice. It just doesn't seem like at least we don't find any demand destruction at all. So even if hopefully, a year from now, the year-over-year costs are not up as much, even come down a little bit. I mean, this is price, this is not surcharge, so it should be pretty sticky. It should hold off in the back half of the year. Help incremental even more or so. Craig Arnold : Yes. I mean, [Indiscernible] we're hoping it plays through exactly the way you articulated. David Raso : Alright, thanks a lot. Appreciate it. Craig Arnold : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our last question will come from the line of John Walsh with Credit Suisse, please go ahead. John Walsh : Good morning, everyone. Thanks for fitting me. Craig Arnold : Good morning. John Walsh : Maybe just a clarification question obviously, we all want to take the sales from the supply chain and Electrical America is this quarter and run them through into next year. I just want to confirm that these are truly deferred sales and none of it was a lost sale in some of the low voltage, faster book and ship stuff that goes through distribution? Yes, I think and once again, this is one of the things John, where you can -- and I would never say that, a 100%, right? There's always going to be on the margin, perhaps in order or 2 that you've lost, as a result of your inability to deliver. But by and large, the fact that the backlog is up more than 50%. By and large we typically have in the Americas. Especially, we have dedicated distributors who are essentially Eaton distributors who are committed to our relationship, and essentially through our business. Once again, we feel very confident that with our order growth and backlog growth that, we're going to hold this business Craig Arnold : And the loss miss shipment today become simply a future deliveries. And so that's kind of what we think is the case for the vast majority of the delta. Let's say in growth that we've experienced in the quarter. John Walsh : Great. Just wanted to make sure I understood it correctly. Craig Arnold : Keep in mind also, these are typically projects. So much of this business goes into projects and on a project where you specify a particular supplier for your Electrical switchgear. It's very difficult once a project has been specified in one buyer, particular supplier, or the other for that to just simply be changed out to another supplier. So I'd say that, yeah, we feel fairly confident. John Walsh : Great. And then maybe can we just get a little color on what you're seeing in China specifically, maybe around data center, industrial, commercial, more of those industrial verticals? Craig Arnold : I think we're all reading the same headlines with respect to what's going on in China today. In an economy that has certainly slowed a bit this year and more than anyone anticipated with special pressures, let's say on the residential segment of the market, I will tell you that in our own business that our China team just had an outstanding quarter. They are certainly part of the electrical global segment, whereas you can see that segment post an 18% growth. I would tell you that our Asia business numbers weren't terribly different than that, until we had a very strong quarter in China.  I think we're starting to see some of these real benefits of the joint ventures that we put in place. And we're seeing a lot more opportunities today than we have historically. Our data center business in the Asia-Pacific region, in China, it's doing well. And so we're obviously watching the headlines and reading them as well as anyone, but today what we've seen in both orders and in revenue out of our China business, our Asia business is doing quite well. John Walsh : Great. Appreciate the color. Thank you. Craig Arnold : Thank you. Yan Jin : Okay. Hey, thanks, guys. We have reached to the end of the call and we do appreciate everybody's participation and questions. As always, Craig and I will be available to address your follow-up questions. Thank you again, and have a great day. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That does conclude our conference for today.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.  I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Yan Jin. Please go ahead. Yan Jin : Good morning, everyone. I'm Yan Jin, Eaton's Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you all for joining us for Eaton's Fourth Quarter 2021 Earning Call. With me today are Craig Arnold, our Chairman and CEO; and Tom Okray, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our agenda today, including the opening remarks by Craig, highlighting the Company's performance in the fourth quarter. We'll be taking questions at the end of Craig's comments. The press release and the presentation we'll go through today have been posted on our website. This presentation includes the adjusted earnings per share, adjusted free cash flow and other non-GAAP measures. That's reconciled in the appendix. A webcast of this call is accessible on our website and will be available for replay. I will remind you that our comments today will include statements related to the expected future results of the Company and are therefore forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ projection due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties as outlined in our presentation release and the presentation. With that, I will turn it over to Craig. Craig Arnold : Okay. Thanks, Yan. Let's start on Page 3 with a few highlights of the quarter, and I'll begin by saying that, and despite what's now very well publicized and ongoing supply chain issues, our team delivered solid results in the quarter and a record performance for the year. And in Q4, we generated adjusted EPS of $1.72, a fourth quarter record. Our sales of $4.8 billion up 6% organically, and I'd say here, we had particular strength in residential, data centers and in industrial markets. And I'd say also our aftermarket businesses in both commercial aerospace and vehicle continued to deliver strong growth. We were certainly impacted by supply chain constraints, which had an impact on our revenue, and I'd say especially in our Electrical Americas and our Vehicle segment. The good news is the markets remain strong. Order growth accelerated in the quarter, and we ended the year with a record backlog. For our combined Electrical business, orders were up 21% on a rolling 12-month basis, and our backlog was up 56%. Our Aerospace business also had a significant increase in orders, up 19% on a rolling 12-month basis, and the backlog was up 16%. We also continue to post strong segment margins, 19.3% in the quarter and a Q4 record. And I'd say here, the actions that we've taken to mitigate inflation, our portfolio changes and the restructuring savings are all contributing to the strong incremental margin performances. I'd also note that we benefited from favorable mix in the quarter. And I'd say that our portfolio changes continue to be an important part of our strategy. We're pleased to have completed the Royal Power Solutions transaction a few weeks ago. And the addition of Royal Power will allow us to accelerate our growth in eMobility, and actually in the broader electrical market as the economy continues to adopt more electric solutions. So I'd say, I think you'd agree that we're not sitting still. We're managing the things that we can control operationally while continuing to advance our strategic agenda. Moving to Page 4. I'll highlight a few additional points on our quarterly results. First, total revenues of up 2%, we increased operating profit by 14%. So continue to demonstrate strong operating leverage. Second, acquisitions increased revenues by 7%, which was more than offset by the sale of Hydraulics, which was a 10% headwind. And while not complete, we're certainly pleased with our progress on the portfolio. We continue to drive changes to support our overall goals of creating a company with higher growth, higher margins and more earnings consistency. Third, I'd just point out that our margins of 19.3%, as I noted, were above the guidance range of 18.8% to 19.2% and I think a good indicator of our team's ability to execute operationally while once again, managing the things that are in our control. And lastly, we noted both adjusted EPS of $1.72, and second, margins of 19.3% were Q4 records in the face of the significant supply chain constraints that we've been dealing with. Next, on Page 5, we show the financial results of our Electrical Americas segment. Revenues were up 13%, 5% organic and 8% from the Tripp Lite acquisition. The organic sales growth was really driven by strength in residential, industrial and data center markets. And on a sequential basis, our organic growth did step up from 1% in Q3 to 5%. So we're making progress but still, as I noted, continue to be impacted by supply chain constraints. In some cases, our ability to meet demand was also impacted by labor availability as we had the spike in the Omicron version, certainly at the end of the year. Operating margins of 19.2% were down 190 basis points year-over-year, and the decline was driven really by higher input costs, labor and supply chain inefficiencies and disruptions in our facilities. And on price recovery, we're making good progress. We made good progress in the quarter, but certainly not fast enough to prevent some margin erosion on the net between inflation and price in the way that plays through to operating margins. And as noted in my opening remarks, market demand remained strong, which was reflected in orders and the growth in our backlog. On a rolling 12-month basis, orders were up some 20%, accelerating from up 17% in Q3 and 13% in Q2. And our backlog reached another record, up 57% from last year, and that's 7% higher than it was in Q3. The strongest markets continue to be residential and data centers. And I'd say here also beyond orders, we also have strong momentum in our negotiation pipeline, which was up some 11% in the quarter. Turning to Page 6. We summarize our Electrical Global segment. And as you can see, we delivered really strong results in this segment. Organic growth was 15% with strength in all regions and particular strength in commercial data center and industrial markets. We also delivered significant operating leverage with operating margins of 19.5% and incremental margins of 40%. We did have a little bit of favorable mix here from our exposure to industrial end markets, but we do expect this to continue. Like the Americas, orders remained strong, a 22% increase on a rolling 12-month basis and a step-up from the 17% number we posted in Q3. And our growth -- and our backlog remained above 50%. In this segment, order strength was especially strong in data centers, residential and utility markets. Yes, so I'd say overall, I'd say that our Electrical Global business had a very strong quarter on top of a strong year and is really carrying a lot of strong momentum into 2022. Moving to Page 7, we summarize the results for our Aerospace segment. As you can see, we had a strong quarter. The industry recovery has certainly begun. Revenues increased 40%, 4% organic, 37% from the acquisition of Cobham Mission Systems. And currency had a 1% negative impact. Aftermarket and biz jet, this was partially offset by weakness in military were 24.9%, an all-time record and up 660 basis points from prior year. In the quarter, we had solid incremental margins of more than 40%, which were helped by favorable mix, particularly the growth in aftermarket and by our portfolio actions. Another bright spot in the quarter was the growth in orders in backlog. On a rolling 12-month basis, orders turned positive in Q3 and were up 19% in Q4 with particular strength in commercial markets. Commercial transport, biz jets and commercial aftermarket were all up significantly. And lastly, our backlog was up 16% from last year. Next, on Page 8, we show the financial results of our vehicle business. Revenue was down 2%: 1% organic, 1% from currency. We had strong organic growth in North America truck and in our South America business, which was offset by weakness in global light vehicle markets. As you're aware, we had certainly significant supply chain constraints in this segment, including a number of customer shutdowns that impacted our revenue. We do have -- we think the worst is behind us here, and we'll see improvement in supply chain-related disruptions this year. Overall, I think our team executed well, delivering solid margins of 16.4% and decremental margins of 30%. Turning to Page 9. We have the results for our eMobility business. Revenues were up 4% with growth in North America and Asia, partly offset by weakness in Europe. Like our vehicle business, we experienced significant supply chain constraints and customer shutdowns in this segment. And operating margins were negative 9.1% as we continue to invest heavily in R&D and start-up costs associated with new program wins. As I mentioned earlier, we acquired Royal Power Solutions in January, and it will be reported within the eMobility segment. This is an important acquisition. It's part of our strategy to improve the long-term growth rate of Eaton. First, it expands our addressable market for eMobility with a portfolio of highly engineered terminal connectors for electrical applications. Second, Royal Power has a strong track record of profitable growth and will continue to grow as the electrical content in vehicles continued to expand. And third, Royal will allow us to offer a more complete their products with our own power protection and power conversion products that we're selling in mobility markets. Completion of Royal Power acquisition, we're well positioned to realize our long-term objective here, which is building a new $2 billion to $4 billion eMobility business inside of Eaton. And our cumulative new program wins are now at $800 million of material revenue when you include the impact of new wins from Royal Power. Moving to Page 10. I'll just take a minute to recap 2021 performance before we turn our focus to 2022. First, we delivered strong organic growth for the year, up 10%, with significant strength in our Electrical Global segment, up 15%; Vehicle, up 21%; and eMobility, up 16%. And I'm especially proud of the team for delivering record segment margins of 18.9%, a 250 basis point improvement over 2020 despite the challenging supply chain environment. Our team executed at a high level and delivered incremental margins of 43%. We also had one of the most transformative years in the history of the Company when you think about the portfolio. We completed $8 billion of portfolio actions towards our goal of building this high-growth, higher-margin company with more earnings consistency. And we're off to a good start in 2022 with another value-enhancing acquisition in Royal Power. The result of our disciplined execution, the transformative portfolio of actions allowed us to deliver 35% growth in adjusted EPS. And importantly, our shareholders were well rewarded for their commitment to Eaton with a total shareholder return of 47% for the year. Our 2021 results certainly set a high bar for what we expect of ourselves and I'm sure what you expect others of us as well. But we're up for the challenge, and we think the best years are still in front of us. Yes, so let's just turn our focus to 2022. On Page 11, we show organic growth and margin guidance by segment. Overall, we expect organic growth to be 7% to 9%. Starting with our Electrical businesses, Americas and Global are both expected to grow 7% to 9%, and we expect these businesses to see growth really across all end markets, with particular strength continuing in data centers, distributed IT and industrial markets. In Aerospace, we expect organic growth of 10% to 12% with strong growth in both commercial OE and aftermarket channels. Our base assumption here is that travel continues to expand from the COVID impact the downturns without any significant new variant. And we expect low single-digit growth in military markets. For Vehicle, we're anticipating organic growth of 7.5% to 9.5% with strength in both light motor vehicles and truck markets. And in eMobility, we're expecting organic growth to be 11% to 13% driven by the continued strength in electric vehicles. And just turning to segment margins, we expect Eaton to be between 19.9% and 20.3%. At the midpoint, this is a 120 basis point improvement over our record margins that we delivered in 2021. And we expect to see margin expansion in all of our segments. Turning to Page 12, we cover the balance of our 2022 guidance. Organic growth, as we noted, is expected to be 7% to 9%, with acquisitions and divestitures subtracting 3.5%, and currency is expected to be flat. We're also forecasting cost to be flat and our tax rate to be between 16% and 17%. Adjusted EPS is projected to be in a range of $7.30 to $7.70, at the midpoint of $7.50, a 13% increase. Operating cash flow is expected to be between $3 billion and $3.2 billion, and CapEx will be approximately $650 million. At the midpoint, our operating cash flow is expected to increase 15% versus last year. Our free cash flow is expected to be between $2.4 billion and $2.6 billion and at the midpoint of $2.5 billion, also a 15% increase. This represents free cash flow to sales of approximately 12% and free cash flow to net income of approximately 100%. And we expect share repurchases to be between $200 million and $300 million, and this really reflects our pivot to what we think is going to be a higher priority on tuck-in acquisitions. And lastly, our Q1 guidance is as follows. We expect adjusted EPS be between $1.55 and $1.65, organic revenue growth to be up 7% to 9%, segment margins to come in between 18.4% and 18.8%, and we expect our tax rate to be between 15% and 16%. If you'd just allow me for a moment, if I could just close with, once again Page 13, which is a brief summary on how we think you should think about the Company. I'd say, first, our top line is supported by strong secular growth trends. And I'd say of note, most of this growth impact is just beginning to show up in our revenue. So most of its still out in front of us, we've proven that we know how to expand margins and are comfortable with our ability to deliver 11% to 13% EPS growth over our planning horizon. We also have clear capital allocation priorities and a disciplined approach to M&A, which we think is paying off. As a result, I'd say we're a different company today. We've transformed our portfolio. We're now a company that will deliver higher growth, better margins, more earnings consistency. And I'd say, once again, we're not done. We also have a long-standing commitment to ESG. It remains at the forefront of what we do every day. In fact, the sustainability for us is really a part of how we drive growth in the Company. Many of you have gotten to know our Chief Sustainability Officer, Harold Jones, and you'll be hearing more from him at our investor meeting next month. In the short term, you can count on us to continue to manage through these operating challenges as a result of COVID, the supply chain disruptions and labor shortages by managing the things we can control. 2021, we think, was an important proof point on our journey to transform the Company, and we're proud of our results. More importantly, we're ready to do it again this year. Now, I'll turn it back to Yan, and we'll be happy to address your questions. Yan Jin : Thank you, Craig. For the Q&A section today, please limit your question to one question and one follow-up. Thanks everyone for your corporation. With that, I will turn it over to the operator to give you guys the instructions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Josh Pokrzywinski : So, a couple of questions here, I guess first on free cash flow conversion. How should we think about some of the moving pieces around there, working capital or otherwise? And what -- when do you think we start to get back to kind of more historical conversion rates? Tom Okray : So thanks for the question, Josh. Appreciate it. We intentionally used GAAP earnings in our prepared remarks when we said we were close to 100% in our free cash flow conversion. And the reason we did this is it's important to look at GAAP earnings when you're going through multiyear restructurings and doing a lot of M&A. So there's really four main items that you need to think about as it relates free cash flow conversion. One is acquisition, integration and divestiture costs, which are going to generate cash requirements for us in 2022. The other one is the multiyear restructuring program. Now while we're at the tail end of that, we will have cash requirements, which will also be in 2022. Another element is, as you probably noted for our guide, we're up $75 million in CapEx investing to grow. And then the final one is a smaller one, but it's relevant, the CARES Act. We still have 50% which is due, which we'll pay in 2022. So if you're using adjusted earnings, you likely got in the low 80s, mid-80s. If you adjust for those four items, you're going to be well into the mid-90s. So I don't think it's a departure between what we've done historically. I think it's consistent. The other thing I would note is we're also growing operating cash flow by $400 million in the year, which is significant. Craig Arnold : And I'd just add, in addition to that, Josh, I mean we're obviously not through a number of these supply chain-related challenges. And so we're certainly, as we think about today, how do we protect customers, how do we get out in front of some of these supply chain constraints, where sales sitting on a fairly large pile of working capital, specifically in inventory, as we're dealing with some of these supply chain-related issues. Josh Pokrzywinski : Got it. That's helpful. And then I guess just speaking of supply chain, probably the volume output here is held back. And we can see that in the 1Q guide, I guess, specifically in Electrical. But if order rates hold, what sort of volume growth are you guys thinking about as kind of in second half or exit rate? Or as some of these supply chain issues abate, how do you guys think about that in the guide here? Craig Arnold : Yes. I mean it's certainly a tough question to really address, I mean, that you can appreciate. We and others have got this thing wrong in terms of how long the supply chain constraints would be with us. But certainly, the underlying order growth in the businesses is a good proxy for where the real demand is. And I'm sure the question that sits just behind this one is that to what extent do you believe there's over ordering taking place restocking in the channel? And I can tell you, as we continue to test for that, we're not seeing it. And our distributors are certainly today calling for more inventory than we're currently able to deliver to them. So much of our business is project-driven. And so on projects, you're not over-ordering on a project. A project is a project. And so if you just look at the order levels that we're seeing in our business, I mean orders and sales at some point converge to the extent that there isn't a bunch of over-ordering taking place. And so, we feel really good about the underlying strength in our markets. We see this tremendous growth in our backlog. And eventually, this stuff is converted to sales. And so, we're talking about our guidance of 7% to 9%, which is well below the underlying order rate that we've seen in our Electrical business. And so at some point, those two things converge. Tom Okray : Yes. I guess for perspective, Josh, we estimated in Q4, just in the Americas, we probably lost about $100 million in sales related to supplier disruption. Craig Arnold : Right, timing, we didn't -- so we think that's one thing those revenues are pushed into 2022 if you just went into the backlog. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Andrew Obin : Just a question on backlog. How much visibility do you currently have from your project backlog? And how does the margin profile of those projects look relative to the current input costs because sort of mixed message from various folks as to how that's going to play out in '22? Craig Arnold : Yes. I'd say that we're not -- we're naturally sitting on a lot more visibility today than we have ever in the history of the business, when you think about this 57% -- 56% growth in the backlog for our Global Electrical businesses. And so, we have much better visibility today than we would have going into almost any year in the history of the Company. And I'd say with respect to pricing in the backlog, I mean, we naturally have seen this inflation trend coming for some time now. We certainly have had the ability to anticipate where it was going as well with respect to commodity inflation. And so we're very comfortable today with pricing in our backlog, and that's certainly reflected in the guidance that we have. But we don't expect like perhaps you've heard from some others, to have a margin impact as a result of a backlog that's not reflective of today's commodity prices. Andrew Obin : Excellent. And just maybe to build on the previous question. So you are highlighting that sort of the underlying free cash flow conversion is close to 100%. But look, I think cash flow is one of the factors here. As we sort of enter this growth, what looks like an industrial growth period, how generally do you think about sort of investments needed in capacity, working capital, supply chain to keep up with demand in the longer term? And how do you see managing it? And what kind of impact do you foresee having on margins, free cash flow conversion, return on capital etc.? Just big picture question. Thank you. Craig Arnold : I'd say if you think about, we talk about these important secular growth trends and the fact that we do expect our businesses we look forward to be a much faster growing business than we have historically and we have had to and we talked about some examples about before make some fairly sizable investments and new capacity to deal with some of this growth that we're going to be -- that we're booking today and will be coming into the future. And so, I would say as you look into the future, certainly with respect to investments in capacity to support demand, we would expect to see a bit of a tick-up in capital spending requirements. Revenue is going to be growing as well. And so if you think about CapEx as a percentage of sales, it probably won't be a material change, but there'll probably be a bit of a tick-up. On the working capital side, I'd say today, we still have opportunities. We are sitting today on record investments in inventory as we try to protect our customers and protect our sites so that they can keep running. And so, I would say I would not anticipate today a large investment in working capital. Once we get through some of the supply chain specific-driven transitory items, I would hope that at some point, it will be a source of cash even as we continue to grow the business. And we literally have built that much inventory inside of the Company to really try to protect customers. But on the working capital -- on the -- excuse me, on the CapEx side, we would anticipate continuing to make investments in capacity in our facilities in resiliency to ensure that we have the ability to support the growth that we see coming. Tom Okray : Andrew, I think it's also important to note is we're not walking away from our objective of 100% free cash flow conversion and 14% free cash flow as as a percentage of sales. That remains something that we're focused on. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Please go ahead. Jeff Sprague : If we could just kind of peel the price/cost to part a little bit further. I just wonder, specifically on price, if you can give us some sense of what the realization was in the quarter and what is embedded in your guide. And also as part of that, Craig, you just kind of mentioned you didn't expect price/cost to be a margin headwind. So, are we -- it sounds like we're probably positive on a dollar rate perhaps. Maybe you could confirm that and just clarify the margin impact, if you will? Craig Arnold : Yes. Appreciate the question, Jeff, and this is obviously one that we're spending a lot of time internally on ensuring that we're recovering all of the commodity inflation that we're seeing in our business. And so my comment -- my opening commentary, I talked about the fact that we saw a margin impact in our Electrical Americas business, specifically as it relates to price and cost, largely because we are, in fact, recovering the dollars, but we're not getting a margin recent fourth quarter, we did not get a margin on top of the recovery. And so, it obviously had a dilutive impact on the margin rate. As we look forward, we do expect that we'll be slightly positive in price cost. We think about 2022 and that will just continue to build from this point forward. So 2022 will be a better year. It will be less of a headwind for sure than we experienced in 2021. And we certainly would expect from an EPS standpoint that it'll be positive to our EPS earnings. On the specific question on what the dollar percentage, Jeff, as we talked about on the last earnings call, and I know it's a number that everybody is looking for, and I can understand why. But we're in so many different businesses, and we have very different inflation rates. When you think about something in Crouse-Hinds, which has a really heavy content of steel versus something that's in one of our other businesses, and so the inflation rates are quite variable. And so we have chosen not to provide that number so as not to confuse customers around prices they're seeing versus what we're talking about on our earnings call. Jeff Sprague : Since you mentioned steel, maybe I'll go there with my follow-up. Obviously, the futures are pointing a lot lower. Perhaps you could just give us an update on the likely lag effects of perhaps deflation on steel coming through the system. You do have some big backlogs to work through. So certainly, I would suspect it's going to take a couple of quarters. But any color there on steel specifically or just the other key commodity inputs that we're all keeping an eye on here? Craig Arnold : Yes. We appreciate the question as well. And like you mentioned, we are, in fact, seeing steel prices kind of retrench a little bit versus where they were last year and certainly where they were in the fourth quarter. And the typical lag time on that can be anywhere from 30 days to 90 days, depending upon which segment of the business and what type of agreement we have with our suppliers. But I would say with respect to commodities overall is that we're really not seeing commodities overall essentially improve. Copper is up. Resin costs are still high. The cost of semiconductors, if you can get them, are up dramatically. And so, we are still living in this inflationary environment. And we would anticipate for much of 2022 that we continue to operate in this elevated environment of input costs. Steel is the one kind of good guy right now, but there are more than enough other bad guys out there in terms of where we're still seeing inflation that are offsetting the benefits that we're going to see from steel. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Nicole DeBlase : I just kind of want to go back to the free cash flow and working capital discussion. So completely understand that this is an area of opportunity, and that's kind of been reflected over a lot of companies that we've heard from over the past few weeks. But I guess when we think about your 2022 guidance, have you embedded continued working capital build? Or are you anticipating that it will be a source of cash for this year? Craig Arnold : I think what's embedded -- correct me if I'm wrong, Tom, but I think it's a slight positive what's embedded in our forecast. Tom Okray : We're looking at some networking capital improvement primarily as it relates to inventory, right? Craig Arnold : So it's not a big needle mover for us in 2022. It is a slight positive is what I'd say. And once again, it could be an area of opportunity. If we get through some of the supply chain-related challenges and more quickly than we're currently anticipating, it certainly could be an opportunity to generate stronger free cash flow. Nicole DeBlase : Of course. Got it. Thank you. And then I guess, just kind of following up and finishing up the price/cost discussion. Craig, you specifically called out Americas, which makes sense. Are you having price/cost headwinds at the margin line in any of your other segments? Or is this just really isolated as predominantly an Americas issue? Craig Arnold : I'd say we're having price/cost headwinds in all of our businesses for the most part. It is just most acute in the Americas. And so I'd say we haven't -- we just -- if you think about today what's going on, and it's kind of interesting what's going on around the world, it's really the U.S. businesses in general that have had the biggest challenges around price/cost. And that's largely on the input side. The inflation that we've experienced in our Americas businesses and our U.S.-based businesses has been significantly higher than what we've seen in other markets around the world. But we're having, let's say, inflationary pressures every place. It's just most acute in the U.S.-based businesses. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Walsh with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. John Walsh : Maybe the first one, can you give us a little more detail on what you're seeing in the data center market globally and if you are actually booking out now to 2023 on some of those projects? Craig Arnold : Yes. John, the data center market has been extraordinarily strong for us during the course of the year and on the back of really what's been a multiyear trend of really strong market. And whether we're looking at hyperscale, whether we're looking at colocations, whether we look at even on-prem, each of those markets have been extremely strong and as has been the IT channel in general. And so I'd say today, if we think about where we're challenged around our ability to really service customer demand to these really strong markets of data centers and residential that certainly have built very large backlogs. And today, we're struggling to keep up with demand. And quite frankly, we think that market, those stay strong for a very long period of time. And you link it back to some of the earlier conversations of where are you going to need to make some capital investments to really deal with some of these longer-term growth trends, it's going to be in markets like data centers, which we think is going to be strong for a very long period of time as the world continues. So as I've said before, generate, consume, process, store just increasing amounts of data. And so I -- and we're sitting on kind of the verge of another big growth wave when we think about 5G, when you think about autonomous vehicles. And so we think that market is going to be strong for a very long time, and we're going to have to continue to invest to keep up with the growth. John Walsh : Great. And then maybe one on Aerospace margins. If I did the math right, it looks like there's a little pressure on the conversion. Obviously, absolute numbers a nice improvement. Is that mix? Or is there something else happening there? Craig Arnold : So when you say pressure on conversion, you're talking about incremental margins in the quarter? John Walsh : Yes, the incremental margins, maybe that's just mix with OE growing faster or something happening, commercial, military. I'm calculating something in like the upper 20s mid- to upper 20s. Craig Arnold : Incremental margins for Aerospace business was 40%, 4-0. John Walsh : I'm saying in the guide, sorry, in the forward look for 2022. Craig Arnold : Why don't you let us get back to you on that in terms of the incremental margins in the guidance? I think you have an acquisition impact on that as well. So -- and I'm not sure what you're assuming in terms of stripping out acquisitions, which obviously don't come out of normal incremental. They come at the underlying margin rate of the business. So why don't you let us get back to you on that one and maybe deal with that off-line. John Walsh : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Joe Ritchie : So, Craig, look, interesting dynamic occurring in the market right now on the inventory side. And saw you guys build inventories this quarter, which makes a ton of sense, obviously, to be able to supply the market. But I kind of want to try to square the comments on distributor inventories being lean. Clearly, no inventories if you're doing a project. What's your sense on the OEMs? Because we are hearing from some of our companies that they are building inventories, but everybody is also saying that the market is still very lean out there. Craig Arnold : Yes. And I'd say that -- I mean, I think it's fair to say everybody would like to build inventory, and we're getting lots of requests to get back to historical levels of inventory with our distributors. And where OEs carry inventory, many of them don't, some of them do. But keep in mind, so much of what we do today is project business in our electrical. And projects, you typically are not finding, obviously, any inventory build there. And so I'd say that this is one that -- it's certainly been one that we've been concerned about. We've been watching. We've been testing for in terms of whether or not there is over-inventory in the system, whether or not there's double ordering in the system. And I can just tell you, having talked with and been engaged with a number of our teams and our distributors, that's not what we're hearing or seeing. They would like more inventory, and their inventory levels today are below where they'd like them to be given their forward look on revenue growth. Joe Ritchie : Yes. That makes sense, Craig. I guess my one follow-on question, I guess, would be more around like Electrical Americas margins. And clearly understand the pressures that you're feeling this quarter. I think lots of other companies were feeling the same. How do you think -- I know that you guys have pretty healthy margin expansion baked into 2022. At what point does that start to turn positive year-over-year? And then -- and maybe just perhaps providing a little bit more color on the cadence would be helpful. Craig Arnold : So when do margins turn positive year-over-year? I mean, what quarter do the margins turn positive? Joe Ritchie : Yes. Just cadence around like the puts and takes on margins as we progress through 2022 in Electrical Americas? Craig Arnold : Yes. I'd say that certainly, by the time we hit Q2, we would expect that our margins would turn positive. I mean, obviously, we're dealing with a number of factors right now in the business. And obviously, what's getting a lot of attention right now is supply chain-related issues. But I can tell you also part of the challenge, as I mentioned in my speaking -- opening commentary that we're seeing significant labor-related issues and inefficiencies at our plants, too. We had pretty large absentees in a number of our facilities at the end of last year, the beginning part of this year as a result of COVID. Our suppliers are seeing the same thing. And so it's not just supply chain, and we can't get parts. And in many cases, we were challenged to get labor and to run our factories efficiently, and so, all of these inefficiencies today are kind of built into the results in Q4 and, to a certain extent, in Q1 as well. So I think it's really Q2 by the time we really get beyond some of the labor inefficiencies. We do think that supply chain continues to get better every quarter. But in some cases, we think we're going to be dealing with supply chain challenges for the entire year when you think about components like semiconductors. But other components, whether that's copper, steel or resins, we do think those things continue to get better every quarter. Tom Okray : It's important to note at the midpoint, which you saw in our prepared remarks, we're 90 bps above the prior year margins in Electrical Americas. So that reflects bullishness that we feel about things correcting throughout the year. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Please go ahead. Julian Mitchell : One starting point perhaps was just within the Electrical Americas business. I just wanted to try and understand sort of on the residential side of that, how much was residential as a whole as a proportion of that business today? And how strongly was the business up last year? And when you're thinking about this year ahead, are you dialing in any kind of slowdown there? I think people are obviously pretty cautious about a number of other resi-facing product categories in multi-industry right now. Craig Arnold : Sure. Appreciate the question. I mean resi today, I think we'd say 18% roughly of our business would go into residential markets. And that market did grow strongly during the course of 2021. I'd say that business was probably up double digit. Tom Okray : It's around 10%, yes, around 10%. Craig Arnold : Double digit, yes. So -- and we're clearly expecting that market to see somewhat of a slowdown, which is baked into our guidance for 2022, still growth in the market, but not at the heavy levels that we experienced on the course of 2021. Now the other thing I think it's important, though, as you think about residential markets to keep in mind, as you really think about this market over the near and the longer term is that it's not just the growth in the housing stock. It really is also the growth in the electrical content in buildings, residential buildings, multifamily buildings as they adopt the new electrical codes, it requires additional electrical content. And as we really start moving seriously into energy transition, we think the opportunities continue to grow at a really attractive rate as consumers have put electric cars in their garages and they have to change their electrical infrastructure support the electric vehicles, as consumers continue to look at things to improve their resiliency, whether that's solar, the ability to island the home, the ability to sell energy back to the grid, all of these things, all of these kind of secular growth trends that are taking place more broadly in the economy are going to also have an impact on residential. And even though, let's say, the housing numbers are not going to grow dramatically, the electrical content we think is going to grow at some multiple of that. That's what we've seen over the last, let's say, 10 to 15 years. And that really didn't even have the impact of some of these energy transition-related trends that we're talking about. The resi for us, we think, continues to be a really attractive market. We have great position in residential, and it's one we'll continue to invest in. Julian Mitchell : And then my second question, I guess, is touching on what Joe had mentioned earlier about inventories. Because I guess if I look at -- say, automotive is one area or light vehicles where we've heard about all the constraints. But there was a very large OEM earlier this week who said wholesale volumes are up 20% plus in 2022, and they could liquidate inventory early in the year. So that I thought was interesting because it suggests that's a massive OEM who feels like they have enough goods on hand to satisfy double-digit growth this year. And so I just want to sort of push a little bit on that point and ask. Are there any areas when you look across different regions or different markets where your salespeople or your channel partners may think maybe there has been a good amount of inventory built up? I don't know if there's any kind of broad views you had on end markets that had more or less inventory relative to norms as you look today. Craig Arnold : I'm sure they're out there, some place, Julian. I can tell you that if they're out there, their voices are being drowned out by probably 100 to 1 on the other side of customers asking us for more. And specifically, as it relates to automotive inventory levels, I mean the inventory levels today continue to run at record-low levels. I mean you think about an industry in the U. S. that has typically run 75 days of inventory has been running under 30 days of inventory. And so I'm surprised that any automotive OEM would say that they're comfortable with the levels of inventories. We're not hearing that from any of our customers. And so that, I think, is a bit of an outlier. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Nigel Coe : You did 9% growth across Electrical in '21. You're forecasting 7% to 9% in '22. Your long-term target is 4% to 6%. So I don't want to get too far ahead of March -- the March Investor Day, but how are you thinking about growth beyond '22 in Electrical? I'm assuming it might be above 4% to 6%. But -- and then kind of allied to that is you're highlighting utility, data center, resi. A little bit surprised you're not highlighting industrial and commercial institutional turning around because we are seeing some strength in orders there. So just wondering what you're seeing in those two specific end markets. Craig Arnold : Yes. I mean, first of all, appreciate your question around the longer-term growth outlook in our Electrical businesses. And to your point, we will be addressing that at our Investor Day next month. And I do think it's reasonable to assume that we've seen certainly more strength than we anticipated, and it would be fair to -- we anticipate that, that number is going to move up slightly. With respect to the end markets, and I'd say for us, certainly, we talk about industrial. Industrial markets are doing well. And we talk about that as being one of the strong markets for us in general. And so we are seeing the strength in industrial. We're certainly seeing the strength in utility, resi, data centers. Even in commercial, I'd say, if you think about commercial, we've talked about this before. We're still seeing growth in office low single-digit growth. It's not huge there, but we're still seeing positive growth in the office segment. And -- but also what goes into commercial is things like warehouses. And as you think about continued expansion of the Amazons of the world and the warehouse segments that have much higher, once again, electrical intensity than an office building or a retail store, we continue to think that there's going to be positive mix associated with -- as we continue to move more and more of our retail activity online. And so as we said, we think all of the markets are going to be growing next year. But we will see some -- what we think would be outsized strength in data centers, in industrial markets, in utility markets. But every market, we would anticipate would see positive growth. Tom Okray : I mean to Craig's point, commercial and institutional, we saw high single digit this year growth in the overall market. And for industrial, we saw mid-teens growth, so very strong. Nigel Coe : That's great. That's great color. And then a follow-on for Tom on free cash conversion. Sorry to go back to this one. But the four things you called out make total sense. I see $0.25 or $0.30 coming orders on restructuring charges and also kind of acquisition charge of the things, what you call it, in the GAAP to headline earnings. But is there stuff wrapped up in purchase accounting on the balance sheet that's going to have cash outflow this year? Is this more a purchase accounting issue? Tom Okray : No. No, it's really the four things that I described : the acquisition, integration and divestiture; the multiyear restructuring; the CapEx; and the CARES Act. And I think you're probably alluding to pension funding and those types of things. Nothing extraordinary there. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Davis with Melius Research. Please go ahead. Scott Davis : Most of my questions have been asked, but I'm kind of curious, it's been a while since we have an upcycle in Crouse-Hinds. Is -- how -- what's your order book look like in that part of the world? And I would imagine you've probably taken some costs out of that business since the last peak. And perhaps you can just give us a little bit of color on that specific business. Craig Arnold : Yes. Appreciate the question, Scott. And for those of you who follow Crouse-Hinds over the year know that, that business that we acquired many years ago from Coupa was a very profitable business, went through a cyclical industry downturn. But when we think about industrial, when you talk about industrial strengthening, that's where a lot of the Crouse-Hinds business goes. I mean many of you think about it as an oil and gas business, but a lot of what they do today goes into industrial markets. And that business is, in fact, growing. And so we are clearly seeing a rebound in the Crouse-Hinds business. A lot of the industrial markets that they support and serve are growing nicely. And so we certainly think we're at the, once again, the front end of what should be a pretty attractive recovery in those markets. Scott Davis : Okay. Good. And then as a follow-on, just thinking in terms of the projects that are out there that you're bidding on, has -- are there less people bidding on projects today than perhaps a couple of years ago just given the reality that everybody's kind of sold out? Or is the competitive dynamic not really changed much? Craig Arnold : I would say that the fact that everybody sold out means that I think everybody is being more selective around the projects that they take, and it obviously changes the price dynamic in the marketplace. And so I'd say that I can't necessarily say that we're seeing less competition on projects. Lead times are being pushed out for lots of companies. And like I said, it's never easy to recover inflation, but we're in an environment today where, given how well-known the issue is and how public and visible it is, it's probably as easy as it's ever been in my professional career because everybody kind of understands what we're dealing with. But I'd say I can't really speak to whether or not we're seeing fewer bidders on projects. But I think every company ourselves included have the ability to be a bit more selective today given the fact that there's more demand than there is capacity. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brett Linzey with Mizuho America. Please go ahead. Brett Linzey : I wanted to come back to capital deployment. This is probably the lowest share repo guide we've seen in a number of years, and you mentioned a focus on bolt-ons. Could you just spend a moment and talk about the actionability of the pipeline, some of the sizes you're shopping? And just trying to understand where you're looking within the portfolio. Craig Arnold : Yes. Appreciate the question. I mean you've probably observed over the course of the last 24 months, we've done quite a bit of portfolio transformation, selling businesses, Lighting, Hydraulics. And we've done a number of acquisitions. And we continue to prioritize our Electrical business and certainly making investments in Electrical that are really tied to these big second growth trends that we've talked about of electrification, digitalization, energy transition. And we'll continue to look for things in that space. You saw us acquire this company called Green Motion last year, which is a play into electric vehicle charging infrastructure. You've seen us do a number of transactions in the Asia Pacific region to really participate in a very fast-growing Chinese market and participate in what we call the Tier 3 Tier 2 market, where we historically have not played. So you're going to see us do things geographically that allow us to penetrate underserved markets. You've seen us do the Tripp Lite acquisition, which is obviously an important play into data centers in the IT channel. And so, I think what you can expect as we move forward is for us to continue to do transactions in this kind of size and scale and really focus on kind of these really important aspects of where we think the future growth is going to. We said that Aerospace continues to be a priority, and we've done a number of important acquisitions in Aerospace. We like the composition of Aerospace businesses. These are technology, highly differentiated businesses. You get paid for your technology. They have very strong aftermarkets. We want to make sure that we're on growth platforms, and that was essentially the play with Cobham. They're sole-sourced on virtually every platform that they're on. They have a growth outlook for that business that takes it from $700 million to $1 billion based upon programs that they've already won. And it's a very profitable business with a strong aftermarket. And so you can count on us to continue to look for acquisitions that are very much consistent with what you've seen us do over the last few years. And I'd say the pipeline today is better than it's been in a while. We're looking at a number of opportunities to really buttress our capabilities in and around some of these spaces that we talked about. Obviously, we're not in a position to talk about anything or to announce anything. But what you're seeing from us is a pivot towards, as we think about how do we deploy our capital and how we can create the most value for shareholders, we think that we can find value-creating acquisitions, pay a fair price for them and generate more value today incrementally than perhaps buying back our stock. But having said that, we said before, we're not going to let cash build up on the balance sheet. If we can't get deals done, we will go back into the market and buy our stock back. And so we're just always just trading off. How do we create the most value for shareholders, either through M&A or stock buyback or similar way of returning capital to shareholders. But it has been great time I've seen from us, and we like what we're looking at in front of us. And we would hope to be able to deploy more capital towards value-creating M&A. Tom Okray : And the only thing I would add is that secular trends give us some really exciting opportunities, such as Royal Power that we can leverage across eMobility, Aerospace and our Electrical sectors. So it's exciting, and we're seeing read across. Brett Linzey : That's great. And then just one last one for me on utility T&D you noted as a driver of the order activity within international. I didn't get a call-out in the Americas business. So I'm just curious, what are you hearing from customers around CapEx? Any change in tone there at all? Craig Arnold : Yes. I'd say that the T&D market continues to be an attractive market. I think as you think about a place where it's in desperate need of some significant investments in aging infrastructure on the one hand, but also, once again, the changing nature of the grid, which is also driving the need and requirement for some fairly significant investments and upgrades in the grid and grid resiliency. And so, yes, we think that in the Americas as well continues to be a really positive story for some years to come. Tom Okray : Grew mid-single digits last year, we expect it to grow the same in 2022. Operator : Thank you. And our final question today will come from the line of Markus Mittermaier with UBS. Please go ahead. Markus Mittermaier : Craig, you mentioned in your opening remarks in the Electrical Americas, your negotiation pipeline is up 11%, if I remember the number right. Is there anything already in there on some of the semiconductor activity that we see? We've heard from some machine builders that there's some early activity there. Just wanted to check if that's already part of that pipeline? Craig Arnold : Yes. I mean I appreciate the question. I don't -- it's a question I can't really answer. I don't have that information on my fingertips right now in terms of where the additional negotiations are coming from -- down to that level of specificity. But maybe, Yan -- we'll ask Yan Jin to follow up with you on that question to give you the color on the composition of where those negotiations are coming from. Markus Mittermaier : Absolutely, but the semiconductor opportunity obviously still remains sort of an interesting one. Craig Arnold : There's no question. I mean to the extent that you end up with a fairly sizable infrastructure, build-out, reshoring and semiconductors and the like, those are all markets that need our electrical switch gear. And so they certainly create great growth opportunities for us. Markus Mittermaier : Great. And then just maybe a very quick one on Electrical Global. You mentioned on Crouse-Hinds earlier the strong growth, obviously, that you see there. Should I interpret the very strong margin profile largely as an effect of Crouse-Hinds? Or is it more broad-based inside of Electrical Global here in the quarter? Craig Arnold : It's definitely broad-based. Crouse-Hinds is helping, but our Electrical Europe business and Electrical is doing a great job of expanding margins. And so we're seeing it both in the, let's call it, the traditional Electrical business, and we're seeing it in Crouse-Hinds as well. The 19.5% margins in the quarter, I mean, which is an all-time record for our Global and it's really contributions from them and, quite frankly, contributions from our Asia team as well. I mean, our Asia business as well, dramatic improvement in profitability over the last number of years. And we're really seeing it. If you think about what makes up Global, it is what we do regionally in Asia, what we do regionally it's the global Crouse-Hinds business that these tend to be global businesses. But all three of those businesses saw a significant improvement in profitability during the course of 2021. Yan Jin : Good. Thanks, guys. As always, Chip and I will be available to address your follow-up questions. Have a good day. Thanks. Craig Arnold : Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. We thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Conferencing Service. You may now disconnect.",

I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Yan Jin. Please go ahead. Yan Jin : Okay. Good morning, guys. Thank you all for joining us for Eaton's Fourth Quarter 2022 Earning Calls. With me today are Craig Arnold, our Chairman and CEO; and Tom Okray, Executive Vice President and the Chief Financial Officer. Our agenda today, including opening remarks by Craig, highlighting the company's performance in the first quarter. As we have done in our past calls, we'll be taking questions at the end of Craig's comments. The press release and the presentation we'll go through today have been posted on our website. This presentation, including adjusted earning per share, adjusted free cash flow and other non-GAAP measures, they're reconciled in the appendix. A webcast of this call is accessible on our website and will be available for replay. I would like to remind you that our comments today will including statements related to expected future results of the company and are therefore forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our projected -- forecasted projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and presentation. With that, I will turn it over to Craig. Craig Arnold : Thanks, Yan. And we'll start on Page 3 with highlights for the quarter. Overall, I'd say we had a strong start to the year, Q1 coming in modestly better than guidance despite additional headwinds and commodities in the quarter. We had a particularly strong quarter in our Electrical Global and Aerospace businesses, and this enables us to deliver a first quarter record for adjusted EPS of $1.62, a 13% increase over prior year. Our sales were $4.8 billion, up 10% organically from last year, and this was above the high end of our guidance range of 7% to 9%. Most of our end markets remained strong with significant strength in industrial, commercial, residential markets for electrical and commercial aftermarket and commercial OE for aerospace. And our orders continue to accelerate, allowing us to post another record for backlog. For our combined Electrical business, orders on a rolling 12-month basis were up 30%, an acceleration from last quarter, which was up 21%. And our backlog for Electrical was up 76% compared to up 56% at the end of 2021. Our Aerospace business also had a significant increase in demand with orders on a rolling 12-month basis up 35% organically compared to up 19% at year-end. We also posted a first quarter record operating margins of 18.8%, which were at the high end of our guidance range, and 110 basis points over prior year. So overall, a good quarter with healthy end markets and solid execution in what remains a challenging environment overall. And I'd say we're also executing well on our strategic growth initiatives as noted here on Slide 4. Highlighted here are several new wins tied to the secular growth trends that we're focused on. We've talked about electrification, energy transition and digitalization. Overall, we continue to see an acceleration in each of these important growth drivers and are convinced that we have the right growth strategy. In the interest of time, I'll highlight one of these recent wins, but we're happy to provide more detail on a follow-up call. While we're not at liberty to disclose the customer, we had another very significant win on an energy transition project. This was a very large follow-on order for EV charging stations in the U.S., where we're providing the full suite of Eaton solutions, including power distribution equipment, entity storages, inverters, control automation and remote monitoring software. And we continue to work on a number of big opportunities focused on building out the needed electrical charging infrastructure given the explosive growth in electric vehicles. Now as the world continues to embrace sustainability, our technologies will continue to play a key part of this solution. Moving to Page 5, we summarize our key financial metrics for the quarter. And I'll just note a few highlights here. First, 3% revenue growth included 10% organic growth, offset by net headwind of 6% from acquisition and divestitures. And this was primarily the Cobham and the Tripp Lite acquisitions, offset by the divestiture of Hydraulics. Our acquisitions added 6 points of growth, while the divestiture of Hydraulics reduced growth by 12 points. We also had negative FX of 1% in the quarter. Second, with 3% revenue growth, we posted solid operating leverage with 9% growth in operating profits and even stronger adjusted growth and -- adjusted EPS growth of 13%. And third, like last quarter, both adjusted EPS of $1.62 and segment operating margins of 18.8% were Q1 records. Now this strong financial performance, we think, underscores the power of our portfolio transformation and our ability to execute well under challenging operating conditions. Next on Page 6, we have the results of our Electrical Americas segment. Here, revenues increased 17%, including organic growth of 10%. And just as a comparison, this compares with 5% in Q4 and 1% in Q3. The acquisition of Tripp Lite added 7 points of growth. Our organic sales growth was driven by strength in industrial and residential markets overall. And as you can imagine, we're still working through supply chain constraints, which saw modest improvements in the quarter but remain challenging. Operating margins were 19.1%, down 140 basis points from last year. And this decline was driven primarily by higher input costs and supply chain inefficiencies and also some increased growth-related investments. Importantly, we were successful in fully offsetting the expected inflationary costs with price increases on a dollar basis. However, we did not earn incremental margins on inflation, which did compress margins. As you'll see in our full year guidance, we expect this to improve, and we continue to expect 90 basis points of margin improvement for the full year. And as I mentioned in my opening comments, market demand remained strong. We had very strong order growth. Our rolling 12-month orders were up 31%, and this compares to up 20% in Q4. So things continue to accelerate. We had strength across all end markets with a range of up 28% to up 36%, and this led to a record backlog, which increased 86% on an organic basis. And on a sequential basis, we posted a large $1.3 billion increase in our backlog. Moving to Page 7, we have a summary of our Electrical Global business, where we had another very strong quarter. Our organic growth was 18% with 3% headwind from currency. We saw strength in all regions with particular strength in commercial and industrial markets. We also generated strong operating leverage, delivering record Q1 operating margins of 19.4% and incremental margins of 36%. Similar to Q4, this included some favorable mix from our exposure to growing industrial end markets, but we expect this to continue. And as we saw in the Americas, orders on a rolling 12-month basis continue to accelerate, up 27% in Q1 compared to up 22% in Q4. We had strength across all end markets with a range of up 22% to up 41%%. And I say for the fourth quarter in a row, we continued to grow our backlog by 50% or more and achieved a new record in the quarter. So our Electrical Global business is very well positioned for continued strong growth overall. Just before we move to the industrial businesses, here's the way that I'd really summarize the performance of our combined Electrical business. The business delivered strong organic growth of 14%, built a sizable backlog which strengthens certainly our outlook for future quarters, and we improved margin by 20 basis points. So on balance, I'd say, once again, a strong quarter given the current operating environment. Let's move to Page 8, where we recap our Aerospace segment. As you can see, we delivered very strong results here with revenues up 38%. This includes 15% organic growth and 25% from the acquisition of Cobham Mission Systems and 2% currency headwind. Organic growth in the quarter was especially strong in commercial aftermarket and commercial OEM markets and certainly including business jets. Operating margins were 22.1%, up 360 basis points versus prior year, and incremental margins were solid at 32%. Another area of strength was accelerating orders, where -- which we saw a rolling 12-month orders up 35% in the quarter, and this compares to up 19% in Q4. We also ended the quarter here with a record backlog on an organic basis, up 14%. And consistent with the broader message of industry recovery, we're currently pursuing $1.3 billion of life of the program opportunities for strategic military and commercial programs, all incremental revenue, so another segment that I'd say that's very well positioned for growth today and for years to come. Next, on Page 9, we have the financial summary of our Vehicle business. Revenues were up 3%, all organic. We continue to see solid growth in North America aftermarket business and in our South America business, which was offset by weakness in global light vehicle markets. As you've read, this market continued to experience significant supply chain constraints, which certainly impacted revenues in the quarter. Just as markets here begin to see some improvements, supply chain issues tied to primarily the war in the Ukraine had a particularly large impact on this market. These constraints also contributed to operating inefficiencies in our business and a 50 basis point reduction in our operating margins. We're undertaking a number of price- and cost-related measures to offset the additional inflation, but it will certainly take some time to get these in place, but certainly something we plan to do before the end of the year. Turning to growth. During our investor meeting earlier this year, we provided an overview of how we're transforming the business by focusing on new spaces and products not tied to the internal combustion engine. And the team is seeing good progress. We continue to see new wins, including a win with a Chinese OEM for our electronic traction control devices. We're also pursuing a pipeline worth $500 million in annual revenue for our powertrain solutions for leading EV OEMs, once again, all incremental. So I'd say that we're well on our way to transforming our legacy Vehicle business by selling into EV and other new markets. And so this business is performing very much like we expected. Moving to Page 10, we summarize our eMobility segment. Revenues increased 52%, including 7% organic and 46% from the acquisition of Royal Power with 1% negative currency. While still negative, we narrowed the operating loss in the quarter, and then we expect to generate positive margins for the year. And the outlook for this market continues to strengthen. Consistent with what you're hearing, we're actively pursuing some $2 billion of new program opportunities, and this number is really growing every quarter. I'd also note that our acquisition of Royal Power added almost $600 million of pipeline opportunities focused on their innovative solutions for terminal connectors and high-voltage busbars. As a reminder here, our area of focus in eMobility is around power distribution, power conversion and power protection. And in the area of power protection, we had previously announced that when using our Breaktor technology with a major European OEM manufacturer. That customer just awarded Eaton with significant additional volume as they are expanding the use of our innovative technology to more of their vehicle platforms. And so once again, another segment where things are progressing very much in the way that we anticipated. Now let's turn to Page 11, where we summarize our updated organic revenue and margin guidance for the year. Overall, and I'd say despite uncertainties in the broader macro environment, we continue to experience strong demand in our end markets. We're increasing our guidance on organic growth for all segments, which results in Eaton's total organic growth stepping up from a range of 7% to 9% to our -- now our expectation of 9% to 11%. This growth outlook, I'd say, is easily supported by our ongoing growth in orders and growing backlog. For margins, we're reaffirming our full year guidance for Eaton at 19.9% to 20.3%, which represents a 120 basis point increase over 2021 at the midpoint. Note, while we've increased organic revenues, we're maintaining our margin outlook. And I'd say this is largely due to additional inflation that we've experienced in the year and expect to see for the balance of the year. We continue to increase prices to offset inflation, but I'd say we're experiencing kind of a normal timing impact and not getting a normal margin on top of inflation. Within Electrical, we're reaffirming our margins for Electrical Americas and increasing the guidance range for Electrical Global by 10 basis points. We've also increased margins for our Aerospace business by 20 basis points and eMobility by 50 basis points. These 3 segments are offsetting the lower margins that we're now expecting in our Vehicle business due to margin compression from the new wave of inflation that we experienced in the quarter and expect for the year and some inefficiencies as well in our operations. But at the midpoint, we expect to deliver record margins and to be north of 20% for the first time in Eaton's history. So on balance, a very strong year. Turning to Page 12, we provide the balance of our guidance for the year. We're raising our '22 guidance on adjusted EPS to between $7.32 and $7.72, which is 14% growth at the midpoint and reflective of what we think is going to be a strong year. We're increasing our organic growth, as we talked about, from 9% to 11%. And this is partially offset by $250 million of negative currency compared to our original guidance, where we thought currency would be flat for the year. So if you think about it, we're also offsetting approximately $0.10 of headwinds from negative currency in our earnings. But for the new FX headwinds, we'd certainly be taking our guidance up more than we did today. And we did complete $86 million of share repurchases in the quarter, and we're on track for a full year guidance of $200 million to $300 million for the year. Lastly, our Q2 guidance includes adjusted EPS forecast between $1.78 and $1.88 for Q2; organic revenue growth between 7 -- excuse me, 9% and 11%; negative currency, we think, will be $75 million; and 8% net revenue impact from M&A. For segment margins, our Q2 guidance is 19.1% to 19.5%, which is a sequential improvement of 50 basis points at the midpoint from Q1. And if you adjust for the $0.10 headwind from M&A, our year-on-year EPS growth in Q2 would be 12%, so roughly in line with our full year guidance for the year of 14%. Lastly, on Page 13, I'll summarize by making here just kind of a few closing comments. As many of you heard at our Investor Day and as I highlighted at the start of the presentation, we continue to experience accelerating growth in our end markets. The secular growth trends are really playing out very much the way we anticipated, and it's really underpinning our strategy as a global intelligent power management company. We're delivering key project wins, for sure, that are also accelerating our growth rate. These 2 revenue drivers are certainly showing up in our order book and growing backlog. So very much just a case of markets inflecting positively. And despite high inflation and supply chain challenges, we're growing our margins. I would also point out that based upon our Q1 actuals and Q2 guidance, we expect to generate 46% of our full year adjusted EPS in the first half, and this is in line with our historical averages of -- for first half earnings. So as the global economy continues to face unprecedented number of challenges, I'd say you can count on our team to continue to execute well to deliver our commitments in both the short and the long term. So with that, I'll turn it back to Yan for Q&A. Yan Jin : Okay. Great. Thanks, Craig. Now it's time for the Q&A. I will turn it over to the operator to give you guys the instruction. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. We'll go to the line of Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Joshua Pokrzywinski : Craig, you've been in this kind of accelerating order environment now for, call it, the last 3 quarters where maybe supply chain is kind of limiting what you can be able to deliver. And the world has changed quite a bit over that time, especially the last quarter or so. What's the composition of the order book look like? And I guess what I'm trying to get at is, have you seen sort of a progression or handoff from some of the more early-cycle stuff to maybe later-cycle or more resource industries? Or is it just kind of a healthy mix of everything where it's harder to tease out what leadership is? Craig Arnold : Yes. I appreciate the question, Josh. And it's certainly been a period of time where I'd say we're really seeing broad-based order strength. And as you know, we would typically highlight strength in particular end markets, but quite frankly, we're seeing strength across the board. And that's why we talked about, for example, in our Electrical Americas business, we said we have a range of strength at the very low end, up 28%; at the high end, up 36%. The same thing is true in our global business where we said at the low end of the increase, it was 22%; at the high end, it's 41%. So as you can imagine, I mean this is very broad-based strength across just about every end market that we serve. So things today, I think, are very strong across the board, and it's tough to really find much in the way of differentiation between some of these end markets because the numbers are just that good. Joshua Pokrzywinski : Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe just a follow-up more specifically on the relationship there with price. So I know there's a lot of factors driving orders right now, and you mentioned some of them just from broad demand. But I would have to think that some of that comes from customers wanting to get ahead of price increases. And it seems like, just listening to some of your peers out there, that the pace of those increases is starting to kind of subside. What would be your observation on kind of that relationship between orders and folks getting out ahead? And have you noticed anything in your own book here in 1Q as maybe there hasn't been quite the same rate of increases as you saw maybe second half last year? Craig Arnold : Yes. I'd say this is one that we spend a lot of time, Josh, and really trying to get a sense for, assuring ourselves first and foremost, that all of these orders are real. And as you know, we're largely in the project business, where we can say that the orders that we're taking are all tied to project. Now are we getting some of these orders perhaps maybe a little earlier in the process -- project process in terms of the cycle? There could be a little of that taking place for sure. So to the extent that we're getting some benefit from seeing orders earlier in the project, that certainly maybe giving us a little bit of lift. A lot of our business, as you know, also goes through distribution. And I can tell you, in the distribution channel, with almost no exception, they don't have as much inventory as they like. And inventory levels today are below levels that they'd like to support their future outlook for the business overall. And so I do think this is just a broad-based strengthening in many of our end markets. To your point on price and are things slowing down, I think it's really a function of what your call is on inflation. I'd say that certainly coming into the year, we anticipated that inflation would moderate. And as a result, there'd be fewer price increases that we would put in forth during the course of 2022. But yet what we saw in Q1 is we saw commodities, for the most part, increase. And so we, like others, certainly are back in the market again, taking prices up to deal with the latest round of inflation, some of which is obviously being driven by what's happening in the Ukraine, some of which being driven perhaps by another wave of shutdowns that are taking place in China. But I would say that, for the most part, certainly, we are seeing more inflation this year than we anticipated. And at this point, I'd say it's too early to call on whether or not it has fundamentally slowed down at this point. Operator : Next we go to the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Joseph Ritchie : Craig, can you maybe just touch on margins for a second? You have a really good start to the year. When you take a look at the guidance -- the updated guidance for the year, the one segment that probably has the most wood to chop, I guess, in terms of getting within the range is Electrical Americas. So just help frame how much of this is either additional price coming through, supply chain using better volume leverage. How do we get from that low-19 percentage range to what the guidance is for the year? Craig Arnold : Appreciate the question, Joe. And I can tell you, one, we have high level of confidence that Electrical Americas will absolutely deliver the guidance for the year. And what we've been chasing, as you can imagine, for some time now is we have been chasing commodities with price. As I mentioned a moment ago, we did anticipate coming into the year that inflation would have abated somewhat, and we ended up taking more inflation in Q1 than we anticipated. And so we've obviously had to go to the market for additional price. And so if you think about the back half of the year and going into subsequent quarters, we're going to have a better relationship between price and inflation. And the other thing that we certainly have seen in our Americas business, we've seen a lot of inefficiencies associated with kind of supply chain disruptions. As you can imagine, if you're missing one small component, you have a bunch of people standing around in factories not able to complete assemblies. That drives fairly material inefficiencies in your operation. And so we do anticipate, as we look at the back half of the year, although we're not looking for a dramatic improvement, we are expecting some modest improvements in supply chain. And we are expecting, quite frankly, to deliver better price versus cost in terms of commodities in the back half of the year. And those would be the 2 principal things that will allow us to increase margins. The other big piece is volume is increasing, right? So certainly, look at Q1 as always the lowest quarter for our Electrical Americas business. And so there'll be naturally some margin lift on simply the higher volumes that are going to come based upon the seasonality of the business. Joseph Ritchie : Makes sense. That's helpful. And then maybe just a broader question. So fully recognize your order rates have been really good and continue to accelerate. And to Josh's question earlier, the environment has changed. I'm just curious, from your perspective, how do you see this all playing out? In Europe, there's a lot of concern around demand rationing, China with the lockdowns. Just help us -- kind of love to get your perspective on how you think things will play out over the coming quarters. Craig Arnold : Yes. And I'd say that I wish I had a crystal ball to really give you kind of a better than an educated guess on the way we see things playing out. But our business certainly in Europe, we don't have, number one, very large exposure to Russia, Ukraine. It's an immaterial piece of our revenue overall. And so we don't think we're going to see any material impact at all from a direct standpoint in terms of what's happening. We do have some supply chain largely, as we talked about in our Vehicle business, where we're seeing the biggest impact, as you know as well. It certainly will have an impact on the semiconductor industry potentially. So I'd say at the micro level, we think it's very manageable in terms of what the ultimate impact will be on our business. On the more macro level, in terms of the geopolitical and trade sanctions and the like, that one, I think it's, quite frankly, just too early to make a call on what the downstream implications are going to be in terms of sanctions. As you know, I mean Russia today is a very small part of global GDP. So I don't think, once again, having a decoupling of Russia from the global economy will have a material impact on our end markets or our business. It just really becomes the sanctions and whether or not it does anything in terms of underlying business confidence and their willingness to make investments. But I can tell you so far, I mean things have held up. As you saw in our order book, extremely well, and we've not really seen any slowdown at all related to the war in Russia and -- or excuse me, in the Ukraine. And at this point, we're just -- as a company, like we always do, we think the key is you have to be agile and flexible and be willing to make adjustments as needed as the situation unfolds. Operator : We'll next go to the line of Steve Volkmann with Jefferies. Stephen Volkmann : My question is also kind of related to the backlog in Electrical. Obviously, very impressive. But at the same time, Craig, you've talked about raw materials sort of reaccelerating. So I'm curious sort of how we handle that -- those 2 things together in terms of do you have some ability to reprice backlog if you need to? Is that something that you're pushing more as the cycle progresses? Or is there potentially little risk if inflation continues to move up? Craig Arnold : Yes. No, appreciate the question. And I'd say that while it's not something that we do often, and we obviously think long and hard before we would do it, but we have had to reprice the backlog in some cases. It's something that we went through in Q4. And I'd say that today, what's baked into our guidance is very much manageable in terms of our expectation around inflation and price. And obviously, we tried to anticipate some of this as we think about the next wave of price increases that are going in. And so as we sit here today, we don't have an expectation of needing to reprice the backlog. It's fully baked into our guidance and our plan. But I'd say that in the event that we ended up in a situation where things got materially worse in terms of commodity input costs, it's something that we've done in the past and we would be willing to do again. But at this junction, we don't think we need to. We think we have a plan that makes good sense. And it's fully baked into our guidance that commodities essentially stay at these relatively high levels. We're not anticipating that commodity costs retreat in any material way in the back half of the year. If we do, that's upside, but that's not our base case. Stephen Volkmann : Understood. And somewhat unrelated, eMobility seems to be progressing well. And I'm curious now that we're a ways into this, are you still convinced that having eMobility and Vehicle sort of under the same umbrella, as it were, is a competitive advantage? Are there some data points or anecdotes that might suggest that that's part of the success in eMobility is having a Vehicle business? Craig Arnold : No. That's very much still the case, Steve, from our perspective. We -- from the very fundamental idea that says they're all the same customers. And so we have a seat at the table. We have a reputation. They know us. We know them. We know the application. And that's always been our thesis around why we thought we had the right to win in eMobility : one, because we know the customers, the markets and the applications; and secondly, it's essentially electrical technology. And so we come at it from both a customer intimacy standpoint and an application intimacy standpoint by virtue of our legacy position in vehicle and we come at it from a technology standpoint given our heritage on the electrical side. And it really is this connection on both sides of the house, I think, gives us the ability to win in that market. If you think about this Breaktor win that we talked about in our eMobility business, I mean that's largely technology that was first created in our Electrical business, then taken and lifted by the eMobility team modified for a vehicle application, but the origins of that technology actually came out of our Electrical business. And so we do think the synergistic nature of what we do as a company is what gives us the right to win in the eMobility space. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Andrew Obin : So just a big-picture question. So structurally, right, I mean I think most multis this quarter actually had negative volumes, right, despite price being very positive. We had negative GDP. So structurally, what do you think needs to happen with the U.S. supply chain to debottleneck it? And what do you see actually happening among your supply chain? And how long do you think it will take to sort of normalize things? And what are the key bottlenecks as you see them? I know it's a big sort of picture question but would love to pick your brain here. Craig Arnold : Yes. Yes. No, I'd say that -- and as you rightly point out, Andrew, the U.S. has been an outlier. We've not experienced anywhere near the same level of supply chain disruptions in our European or Asia business. And I do think that so much of the challenge in the U.S. is that the U.S. companies, ourself included, have really relied very much heavily on global sourcing in our operations that has obviously created greater interdependencies in terms of supply. We in the U.S. had some of the unique issues around labor and some of the port congestions. We also dealt with, as the world did, these pretty significant downturns in the markets associated with COVID and then a very strong V-shaped recovery that has continued. And so it's -- in many ways, it's been a perfect storm with respect to creating challenges for global supply chain businesses like our own. So I'd say -- so what's happened since -- I mean clearly, you've read about and there's lots of discussion and work going on around certainly nearshoring, reshoring of manufacturing in the U.S. I think you're going to continue to see more of that, and that will certainly benefit Eaton given our relative outsized position in the U.S. market. I think you have a lot of companies, ourselves including, who are really looking at their supply chain resiliency in general. And there'll be, in many cases, some dual sourcing to create additional redundancy in supply chain. So as we -- if we end up having to go through another event like this that we can absorb the shock a little better than we did this time around. And so I do think that this event, and I don't know if it's a black swan event or not, but it certainly has forced companies to really take a hard look at their supply chain resiliency and whether or not we have enough capability to deal with shocks in the system without fundamentally shutting down our businesses. And so there's going to be -- as a result of that, we think also good for Eaton, I think there's going to be more investments in facilities and plants and factories as companies continue to build out some redundancy in their capability and build more local sourcing into their supply chain. Andrew Obin : And just a follow-up question. You did sort of highlight that you see strength across the board, but can we talk about on the utility side? Clearly, more talk about renewables. We have stimulus. Are you seeing any projects start to get into the pipeline tied to U.S. or European stimulus there? Craig Arnold : Yes. I think tied to stimulus dollars, certainly, we're seeing a lot of activity, a lot of, I could say, projects in the discussion phase. I don't know today, Andrew, if we've seen material dollars from stimulus that have started to flow yet. We really think that's more of an end of '22, 2023 kind of impetus for the business more than we're seeing in our business today. I think what we're seeing today largely in and around utility investment is really much more tied to grid resiliency. It's much more tied to the fact that aging infrastructure. It's much more tied to the increase in electrification much more today than it is tied to the direct stimulus dollars. But that's clearly coming. Operator : We'll now go to the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Nigel Coe : So Americas, I want to come back to Americas margins. So the 1Q margin was actually pretty flat with 4Q. And I think I'm right in saying that normally, 1Q would be weaker than 4Q. So I take that as a positive sign that things have improved there. What would you say is driving that improvement primarily? Is it price/cost? Is it productivity, be it labor or kind of the sequencing of materials in? Anything to help us on that sort of improvement sequentially? And then can we then think about Americas margins due to the normal sequential uplift from 1Q to 2Q? Craig Arnold : Yes. Appreciate the recognition on that, Nigel. You're absolutely right, by the way. Q1 has historically always been a down quarter for Electrical. A lot of that is volume-related. And what we've seen historically in the business, we typically see a seasonal volume reduction in Q1 versus Q4. And as a result, margins on a decremental basis go down. And we are pleased the fact that they actually held up nicely in this Q1. But the biggest difference between, I'd say, the overall profitability level largely is we're doing a better job in managing price/costs overall. We did, in fact, in Q1, while still not out of the woods, we did see a little better supply chain performance in Q1 around certain commodities that actually got a bit better in the quarter. And so I think it's really those 2 things : better price/cost achievement in the quarter and a little better supply chain performance from our suppliers. Thomas Okray : Yes. Included in the price/cost is how we're taking cost out of our direct material and our logistics as well. And to come back to the other part of your question, yes, you can expect to see margins improving in Q2 versus Q1. Nigel Coe : Great. And then my follow-on is Aerospace. You took up Aerospace by 2 points for 2022. Maybe just talk about that. What drove that? And I'm particularly interested in the outlook for defense because that was obviously a problematic end market in your 2022 outlook. So wondering if given the kind of the good news or -- that's not the right word, but given the improvement in defense budget outlooks globally, are you starting to see some of that benefit coming through in the back half of the year? Craig Arnold : Yes. Appreciate once again. That did not call out as well in Aerospace, really did have a very strong quarter and delivered very strong profitability overall. And I'd say in Aerospace, it's really a function largely of where we're getting the growth. I mean aftermarket, as you know, and Aerospace had been depressed over the last number of years. And so we saw very strong growth in the aftermarket side of the Aerospace business. And aftermarket, as you know, carries a much higher profitability, and we certainly would expect that to continue as we look forward. We also, in Aerospace, like in our other business, did a better job of managing price versus input costs and getting price to offset inflation, which was very helpful for the business. And then to your point on defense, I'd say defense spending, largely -- we're looking at a year today where it's, on average, flat to maybe up slightly. And we really think that the defense budgets, as you think about the fiscal '23 defense budget for the U.S. and around the world, certainly, influenced, we think, also by what's happening today in the Ukraine. We think budgets are going up on the defense side of the business. And so we had a case assumption of what we thought defense market is going to look like over the next number of years. And we think that number is certainly going up, given already public proclamations from many governments around the world around them increasing their defense spending. And so we think the Aerospace outlook, although you hate to benefit from these kinds of events in the world, but we'd certainly think defense spending is going to improve as we go forward. But it's largely going to be, we think, a 2023 story more than this 2022. Operator : We'll now go to the line of Scott Davis with Melius Research. Scott Davis : Just, Craig, on the topic of Aerospace while we're there. Are the airlines starting to rebuild inventory in spare parts at all? Have you seen that occurrence? Craig Arnold : Yes. I mean the short answer is yes, and it's part of what's driving the strong growth that we're seeing in our aftermarket business. So absolutely. Scott Davis : Okay. That's helpful. And then going back to kind of the early prepared remarks, you talked about this EV charging contract that you got and the different SKUs that you supplied into it. What do you -- what are you not getting, meaning are there key components that -- could you potentially handle the full project? Will it ever get bid out that way on a full project basis as opposed to buying componentry? Or how do you see that playing out, I guess, is an open question? Craig Arnold : Yes. Thanks for the question, Scott. I mean as you can imagine, I mean there's just really large opportunities by various customers in different parts of the platform. And so yes, we're winning content, and we're also passing on content as well because we don't think it's going to deliver the returns that we expect as an organization. We're focused, as I said, on how do you distribute power, how do you convert power and how do you keep it safe inside of the car. And so we are certainly being selective, I'd say, in terms of where we think we can participate in this growth in EV. As -- we talked about this goal that we set for creating a new leg inside of the company and the revenue goals that we set. That number could actually be much higher if we were going to be kind of less discriminate in trying to participate in every opportunity that's out there. So I'd say that this kind of $2 billion to $4 billion number that we put out there is really taken into consideration that we think there's going to be places where we have technology that allows us to differentiate to offer real value to the customers. And there's going to be other elements of what's happening in electrification that's more commoditized, and we're going to stay away from the commoditized stuff and really focus on the places where we offer a differentiated technology-based solution. And that's -- those are the kinds of programs that we're winning. Those are the kinds of programs that we want to win. Scott Davis : Yes. I was asking specifically about the charging contract, not the EV platform. Craig Arnold : Oh, the charging contract. Okay. Scott Davis : Yes. Is it the same answer? I don't want you to have to repeat. Craig Arnold : Yes. So that's also true, but I was thinking you were talking about the eMobility wins specifically. No, I'd say on the charging contract specifically, as I talked about, it was -- unfortunately, we're not at liberty to disclose the customer's name, but it's one of the big names out there who today is helping build out the nation's charging infrastructure as the world moves to EVs. And once again, I'd say that answer largely applies. I mean there are going to be clearly parts of what's going to happen in the context of charging infrastructure where there's going to be essentially a charger that doesn't have embedded intelligence, where it doesn't require a lot of sophistication around the way you manage the load, the energy required, the energy consumed and how you balance the load. Let's call that dumb charging, if you will. There's -- you plug it in and these electrons flow, and it doesn't really require much intelligence in between. And so we're really not today participating in that end of the market. The places where we've decided to compete is where it really does require a fair amount of sophistication in terms of understanding what's happening behind the meter and how much electricity is available, where you typically have multiple vehicles plugged in at the same time. So you have to make sure there's enough electricity available and you have to actually manage the charging in a very intelligent way. And that's where we, once again, think we bring the most value to the table, and that's where we think we can make decent returns in that business. Operator : We'll now go to the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Julian Mitchell : One number that stood out to me from the release was the negative free cash flow in the quarter. I think that's pretty unusual for Eaton. So maybe just help us understand kind of the confidence in that full year free cash flow guide. I think the inventories are up sort of 40% year-on-year. So how do we think about those leveling out? And just to make sure that you're still sort of very confident that the inventories for you are very, very high, but the inventories that everyone you sell into and through are very, very low. Thomas Okray : Yes. Appreciate the question, Julian. Prudently, we invested in working capital in Q1 for a number of reasons. One is to really protect the strong growth that we're seeing. Another factor in that is the supply chain constraints, wanting to make sure that we can serve our customers properly. We've also got a dynamic where we have an elevated amount of work-in-process inventory where we're waiting for individual components. And then the final aspect is we just have inflation, and that's driving up the cost of the inventory. As you saw in the prepared remarks, we remain committed to our guide on operating and free cash flow, and we expect cash flow to get better throughout the year. Julian Mitchell : And then just on the point on sort of firm-wide operating margin. So I think a lot of industrial companies are guiding for a big year-on-year improvement in operating margins in the second half, largely due to price/cost dynamics. I think for Eaton, it's very, very level-loaded. You're up, I think, 110 bps in the first quarter. You're saying the year is up 120. So just trying to sort of gauge. I think you're saying that price/cost dynamics improve for you as well, but it doesn't seem to be embedded in that margin rate guide. Is there any sort of specific headwinds kind of coming the other way? I know Aerospace has a tough margin comp in the fourth quarter and that kind of thing. Maybe just any sort of help around that margin guide. Craig Arnold : The way I think about it, Julian, and generally, there's still -- as you guys know as well as us, there's still a lot of uncertainties out there in the marketplace. Whether it's supply chain, whether it's COVID-related shutdowns that are going on in China, whether it's the downstream implications of the war in the Ukraine, there is a lot of uncertainty that still exists in the marketplace. And so given where we sit today, we just think it's prudent to say that, let's be a little bit on the cautious side with respect to the outlook for the back half of the year. I mean the reality is, if we end up with a better supply chain environment, if the lockdowns in China resolve themselves more quickly than we anticipate that they will, if the impacts of the war in the Ukraine are more contained than perhaps they are right now, there could be certainly upside in the back half of the year. We just think at this juncture, it's really not prudent to make those assumptions. And so we put in place a forecast that we think makes sense in the context of the current economic environment and the political environment that we're dealing in. Thomas Okray : And just to reinforce something that's in the prepared remarks, which you noted, which is a very good thing, we don't have a hockey stick plan. We don't have a back half-loaded plan. We're 46% in the first half. We're 54% in the second, which is consistent with what we've done in history. Operator : We'll next go to the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Deane Dray : Can you comment on inventory in the channel, specifically distributor inventory? Where does that stand? Craig Arnold : Yes. And I'd tell you, I mentioned that briefly in my comments in response to another question. I think today, Deane, if you -- every conversation I'm having with our distributor partners is that they all want more. I mean today, inventory levels from where they sit are not where they'd like them to be. We continue to have challenges around today supporting all the demand. That's one of the reasons why certainly our backlog is growing the way it's grown, principally in our Electrical businesses. And so I'd say today, inventories in the channel are in better shape than they want them to be in with respect to they don't have enough. And so at this juncture, I'd say we keep testing for that and make it to ensure that there isn't double ordering taking place and ensuring that people aren't putting provisional orders in the systems to get their place in line. But I can just tell you today, based upon where inventories sit in respect to the outlook for the year, inventory levels in the channel today are below, and in some cases, well below where they'd like them to be. Deane Dray : That's helpful. And then on infrastructure spending, you're starting to see any initiatives around like grid hardening, bearing power lines. Has that started to show up in bid activity? Craig Arnold : Yes. I'd say it's still early days, Deane. And we think it's another place where it's certainly needed. We think it's coming. But I'd say today, even around the margins, the utility markets, I'd say, like our markets in general, are performing well. How much of that is tied specifically to grid hardening, how much of that's tied to energy transition, tough to really say and bifurcate the 2. But I'd say today, we are certainly seeing strength in utility markets, very much like we are in our other end markets as well. Operator : Next we'll go to the line of Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc. Jeffrey Hammond : I just had one quick follow-up. Craig, you gave some color on kind of what's different between global and Americas around supply chain and labor. But anything else in there around if you look at just the global margins versus Americas in terms of momentum around mix or where they are on price/cost or structural opportunities globally versus Americas? Craig Arnold : Yes. There's really not much to add, Jeff, to what we said. I mean clearly, as we talked about the global segment, we're certainly getting a benefit from better mix as industrial markets continue to rebound. As the Crouse-Hinds business -- global Crouse-Hinds business continues to rebound coming back to more historical levels of profitability, that's certainly helping profitability in global. As I mentioned, once again, they're seeing less inflation in commodities. They're seeing fewer supply chain disruptions, so fewer operational inefficiencies in their facilities as well than the Americas business. And so that's also part of the story of, I'd say, more of what's holding the Americas back, like it's not even better than it is right now. But no, I don't really think there's anything else going on. And certainly, if you take a look at our outlook for the year, we fully anticipate that the Americas business margins will be up some 120 bps this year, and so it's going to be a good year. Operator : We'll go the line of Brett Linzey with Mizuho. Brett Linzey : First question is just on backlog and revenue coverage. Obviously, backlog continues to build here. Given the project nature of your businesses, I'd imagine you have some visibility on timing. I'm curious, of the current backlog, how much ships this year versus '23? And are you starting to book orders for 2023 at this point? Craig Arnold : Yes. Appreciate the question. And as I mentioned in some of my commentary, we are today with respect to backlog seeing some earlier orders perhaps on some projects than we would typically see them. But I'd say most of what we're experiencing in the backlog is it's fundamentally strengthening in the markets. The markets are strong, and that's largely what's driving the backlog. We are today -- in the backlog, there would be some orders that will certainly ship in 2023. Some of those are planned for 2023 for certain. But I'd say, by and large, the backlog coverage is as good as it's ever been in the history of the business. And so we have better visibility today into what's required wind than we ever have and don't feel like there's much in the backlog today that would be, in any way, a double order or not tied to a very specific project that we've somehow won in the marketplace. Brett Linzey : Okay. Great. And then just my follow-up on the EV charging stations, is there a way to frame Eaton's content per site and what that profitability looks like as those wins ramp? And then was that booked in the quarter? Or was it in April? Craig Arnold : That win was -- the one we talked about specifically was in the first quarter. What we try to do is be pretty clean with respect to orders. And so anytime we talk about an order booked on these calls, it will always be in the context of the order -- the quarter that we're talking about. But in terms of the profit, the profitability of those businesses, I think it's really -- it's early, right? We're still in the early stages of -- fundamentally of the build-out the electrical charging infrastructure in general. But I'd say we have an expectation in the company, and we have a standard in the company around what an attractive business looks like. And as we think about the way we bid projects and programs and the margin expectations, we have no reason to believe that the margin expectation in EV charging infrastructure will be any different than the underlying profitability for our Electrical business. Operator : And our final question will come from the line of Phil Buller with Berenberg. Philip Buller : Just on the topic of Q2, I think, Craig, you answered some of this in Julian's question. You were referencing that there's a lot of uncertainties out there, which you appear to have baked into a relatively conservative margin guide for the course of the year. But I guess I'm just a little surprised that the Q2 top line guide is as strong as it is, 10% organic at the midpoint. Just on a gut-feel-type basis, feels pretty high given all of those uncertainties that are out there. So I was hoping you could just expand on what the Q2 planning assumptions are. Is it equally broad-based? Or are you particularly bullish or potentially cautious on one specific end market or another, be that residential or industrial? Or perhaps there's some specific geographies that we need to be calling out. I'm thinking of places such as China. Craig Arnold : I think it's -- I mean as we think about the Q2 revenue guide at 10%, we don't think that's in any way an aggressive number. If you just take a look at the growth in the backlog, the growth in orders, I mean that number could quite frankly be much higher if we had the ability to ship and satisfy all the demand that we're seeing in our businesses today. We are banking on the fact that we are going to see some modest improvements in supply chain and availability. But no, that growth number is in no way an aggressive number in the context of the real underlying demand that we're seeing in our businesses. So we're very comfortable with the growth number in Q2. Philip Buller : That's great. And just to follow up, just not wanting to labor the point. But to be clear, the order strength that we're seeing, we shouldn't be attributing much of that growth to the giant project-type orders that you called out like the EV charger -- EV OEM charger-type project? That's a big deal, a big project, but it's not the predominant driver of the order momentum we're seeing. It really is quite broad-based. Craig Arnold : No. No, I appreciate the question. But the way the electrical industry works and the business works in all of these projects tend to be in the theme of the total business relatively small. And so no, it's -- we're seeing -- that's why one of the reasons we tried to give some color around the strength in end markets. If you think about today, we talk about we serve commercial, we serve utility, we serve resi, we serve data center, we show -- we serve MOEM, we serve industrial. So we serve all of these end markets. And I talked about in the Americas, a range of growth in these end markets from 27% on the low end, right, to 36% on the high end. So every one of these markets are doing very well right now, and none of our order growth would be tied to any particular one project. The only piece that tends to be a little bit lumpy is sometimes data centers is lumpy. When the hyperscale guys come in, we've talked about that on some earlier calls. Sometimes they'll come in with some lumpy big orders, and sometimes they'll take a quarter off. But for the most part, we're seeing this broad-based strength. Yan Jin : Okay. Great. Thanks, guys. We're reaching to the end of the call. As always, Chip and I will be available to do any follow-up call with you guys. Appreciate everybody joining us today. Thanks.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, today's conference is being recorded.  I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Yan Jin, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Yan Jin : Hi, good morning. I'm Yan Jin. Thank you for joining us for Eaton's second quarter 2022 earnings call. With me today are Craig Arnold, our Chairman and CEO; and Tom Okray, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our agenda today include opening remarks by Craig, highlighting the company's performance in the second quarter. As we have done on our past calls, we'll be taking questions at the end of Craig\u2019s comments. The press release and the presentation we'll go through today have been posted on our website. This presentation, including adjusted earnings per share, adjusted free cash flow and other non-GAAP measures, they're reconciled in the appendix. A webcast of this call is accessible on our website and will be available for replay. I would like to remind you that our comments today will include statements related to expected future results of the company and are therefore forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our forecasted projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our current earnings release and the presentation. With that, I will turn it over to Craig. Craig Arnold : Okay. Thanks, Yan. Appreciate it. And we'll start with a summary of the quarter on Page 3, and I'll begin by noting that we had a strong quarter. We posted a number of all-time records led by 11% organic growth. Our performance was particularly strong in our Electrical businesses, both in the Americas and Global. And as you can see, orders remain strong, and we continue to build record backlogs, supporting the outlook for the year and really, in many cases, I'd say, into next year. And I'd emphasize that nearly all of our end markets remain strong, but we're seeing significant strength in commercial, in industrial and data centers, and residential markets and our Electrical businesses. And in our Aerospace business, we saw strong growth, in the commercial business, both in aftermarket and in OEM. This strength, I'd say, is reflected in order growth in Electrical, which was up 25% and the Aerospace business, which was up 19% on a rolling 12-month basis. And our backlog was up some 74% in Electrical and 12% in Aerospace. As reported, we also delivered adjusted EPS of $1.87, a 9% increase over prior year and an all-time record, more than offsetting a $0.12 headwind from the impact of acquisitions and divestitures. You'll recall that we owned the Hydraulics business in all of Q2 last year. The $1.87 a share was close to the high end of our guidance range as well. We also posted an all-time record segment margins of 20.1%, up 150 basis points over prior year and above the high end of our guidance. So in addition to strong growth, our teams have done really an effective job of managing price to offset inflation. And lastly, we're raising our full year guidance as well. We're increasing our organic growth forecast from a range of up 9% to 11% to up 11% to 13%. And we're increasing our full year adjusted EPS to $7.56 at the midpoint, 14% year-on-year growth and despite additional headwinds from FX, from higher interest expense and lower pension income. Moving to Page 4, we show the financial results for the quarter, and I'll just note a few items here. First, our revenues were flat year-over-year with 11% organic growth offset by the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures of some 9% and 2% from negative FX. And we're certainly very pleased with this level of organic growth, but I would also note that growth could have been much better but for persistent shortages of electronic components and COVID-related lockdowns in China. Second, currency headwinds were worse than we expected in our guidance and almost $150 million impact versus prior year. As you'll see in our forward guidance, we expect this number to get worse in the second half. The FX headwinds will also reduce our adjusted EPS by approximately $0.05 in the quarter. Lastly, I'd like to emphasize that we really did achieve a number of all-time records in the quarter, including segment operating profit, segment operating margins and adjusted EPS. Next, on Page 5, we have the results of our Electrical Americas business, and really just a strong quarter across the board here. As you can see, organic growth up 16% and record segment margins of 23.2%. We delivered strong growth across all end markets, with particular strength in commercial, residential and industrial markets. And organic growth actually accelerated from Q1, up some 10%, and with sequential acceleration in nearly all of our markets with the biggest increases coming from utility, data centers and commercial markets. We did manage to -- through a number of fairly significant supply chain constraints, but did see improvements in metals and resins and logistics, but continue to see challenges in electronic components. Orders on a rolling 12-month basis were up 29% with strength across all end markets with a range of anywhere from up 18% to up 39%. So we continue to be pleased with strong demand that we're seeing in our end markets and with our backlog, which increased some 89% to a new record level. On a sequential basis, our backlog growth was up almost 20% from Q1. We also delivered record operating margins of 23.2%, up 190 points driven largely by better-than-expected volumes. And of note, we were successful in offsetting inflation with price and expect this to continue to be on the plus side in the second half. Turning to Page 6. We show the results of our Electrical Global segment, which produced another very strong quarter, including all-time record sales. In fact, this is our fifth quarter in a row with double-digit organic revenue growth. Organic growth was 12%, with 7% headwind from currency. We saw growth in all regions with particular strength in data centers, commercial and industrial markets. And orders on a rolling 12-month basis were up some 19%, while our backlog grew 38% to a new record level. We also delivered record Q2 operating profits and operating margins. At 18.9%, operating margins were up some 60 basis points from prior year. And lastly, we recently closed a new joint venture in China by acquiring 50% of Jiangsu Huineng Electric, which manufactures and markets low-voltage circuit breakers in China for the renewable energy market. And I'd say here, this is our third electrical JV in China in the last eight months, which allows us to expand our market participation by offering what we'd say is a multi-tiered portfolio of products serving this very high-growth market both inside and outside of China. And on a combined basis, these three JVs increase our addressable market to about -- by about $17 billion. And so really important part of our future growth strategy coming out of these JVs. Before we move to our industrial businesses, here's what I'd summarize the performance of our combined Electrical business. Overall, our electrical sector posted a strong Q2, with 14% organic growth and a 150 basis point improvement in margins. And of note, we really have not seen a slowdown in any of our markets. We continue to see strong growth in orders and backlogs are at record levels. And I'd say that the secular growth trends that we've discussed in the past, including energy transition, are clearly showing up in our order book. Moving to Page 7. We have a recap of our Aerospace segment. Revenues increased 19%, including 10% organic growth, 12% growth coming from Mission Systems acquisition and 3% currency headwind. Organic growth in the quarter was particularly strong in our commercial aftermarket and commercial OEM businesses. On a rolling 12-month basis, orders increased 19% while backlog was up 12%. In the commercial market, as many of you know, travel continues to show positive improvements in both domestic and international markets, certainly a positive indicator for future growth and is consistent with what we saw in the quarter. I would add that while strong, our commercial aftermarket bookings are only at 85% to 90% of their pre-pandemic levels. So we still have ample room for additional growth in this particular segment. And commercial OEM activities, as you've read, also continued to recover. For military markets, we expect to see increased tailwinds in defense spending, including an uptick in U.S. defense budgets. We've already seen renewed commitments from the European NATO members and expect this to lead to increased defense spending over the next several years. We're also pleased with the profitability of this segment as operating margin stepped up 90 basis points to 21.9%. You'll recall that the peak margins for our Aerospace business was 25%. So we expect this number to continue to move up over the next few years. Next, on Page 8, we summarize the performance of our Vehicle segment. Revenues were up 5%, which includes 7% organic growth and 2% negative currency. We had particular strength in the North America light vehicle markets and in our South America business, which was partially offset by flat performance in Europe and weakness in China largely due to the COVID lockdowns. Operating margins were down some 260 basis points driven primarily by margin compression from inflationary costs and the normal lag in our ability to recover price in the marketplace. We do expect that the price inflation equation will improve in the second half, and it's reflected in our outlook for the year. Turning to Page 9. We show the results of our eMobility business. Revenues increased 55%, which includes 11% organic growth, 46% from the acquisition of Royal Power and a negative 2% currency impacts. During the quarter, we also delivered more than $70 million of material wins, including a number of wins that leverage our core competency as a company in power distribution and power protection. And while still slightly negative, we narrowed the operating losses by some 530 basis points. This improvement was delivered -- generated by higher volumes and certainly by the acquisition of Royal Power. I'd also note that at the six-month point, our integration of Royal Power remains on track, and the expected synergies allowing Eaton to sell a broader solution to the marketplace is playing out just as we had hoped. Overall, we continue to make steady progress towards our 2030 goal which is to create a $2 billion to $4 billion business with attractive 15% segment margins. And as we noted at our investor meeting earlier this year, we expect the segment to deliver $1.2 billion of revenues and 11% margins by 2025. Next, on Slide 10, we have the updated guidance for 2022. As you can see, for the second time this year, we're increasing our organic growth guidance for all but one of our segments really based upon continued strength in all of our end markets. We're raising our overall organic growth from 9% to 11% to 11% to 13% on the back really of strength in our Electrical segment, where we've increased growth by 300 basis points in the Americas and 150 basis points in Global. For margins, we're raising our full year guidance for Eaton to be in the range of 20% to 20.4%, which represents, at the midpoint, a 130 basis point improvement over 2021. The two changes in the segment include increasing margin guidance for Electrical Americas by 70 basis points to 22.2% at the midpoint and lowering our margin targets for vehicle by 120 basis points to 16.5% at the midpoint. And as we talked about, the Vehicle reduction really reflects the timing and margin compression associated with inflation versus price realization that we discussed earlier. So overall, I'd say a strong first half, including robust demand and orders, record levels of backlog, and we're very well positioned for the year. Moving to Page 11. We show the balance of our guidance for the year. For the second time this year, we're raising our '22 guidance for adjusted EPS, which is now forecast to be between $7.36 and $7.76 a share. And as I covered on prior pages, we're increasing our organic growth outlook to 11% to 13%. I would note this is partially offset by $250 million of negative currency, which compares to our previous guidance of negative $250 million. The stronger dollar requires us to, in this case, offset some additional $0.08 of earnings versus our prior guidance, which we are clearly doing and is reflected in our outlook. We also expect that our corporate expenses will now be $20 million to $40 million above 2021 levels or between $580 million and $600 million. So another $0.04 to $0.08 headwind that we are offsetting in our adjusted EPS guidance for the year and this is primarily due to higher interest expense and lower pension income. So to recap, we're raising our adjusted EPS guidance by 4% -- by $0.04 despite between $0.12 to $0.16 of incremental headwinds from FX, interest and pension. The remainder of our full year guidance remains unchanged.  And now just a few highlights on our Q3 guidance. We expect adjusted EPS to be between $1.95 and $2.05 per share, organic growth to be between 13% and 15%, and segment margins to be between 20.6% and 21%. And at the midpoint of our guidance, margins are expected to be up some 70 basis points from Q2. And at EPS midpoint of $2 a share, our Q3 guidance represents 14% growth versus prior year. So just wrapping up on Page 12, just to recap a few points. First, I'd say we continue to realize the benefits of our active portfolio management, which is certainly showing up in our record levels of financial performance. Second, we're seeing secular trends that are enhancing our end market growth rate now and we fully expect this to continue into the future. We've discussed growth in electrification and energy transition and digitalization for some time now. And these trends, really, I'd say, have only accelerated. So despite all the talk about a potential slowdown and downturn in the market, and we'll be ready if we have one, we're focused on investing to capitalize on what we see as the super growth cycle, driven by favorable trends and the recovery in some of our other end markets. So every time you hear sustainability, climate change and resiliency, you're really hearing about growth opportunities for our company that we're capitalizing on today and will be for the foreseeable future. And this is certainly showing up in our sales results, our orders and our backlog, which are all at record levels. Now these factors obviously contribute to our confidence in our ability to raise guidance for the year. But more importantly, I'd say they really give us confidence in the long-term outlook for the company. In the short term, we're working through supply chain disruptions, focusing on controlling the things that we can control, building more resilience in our operations and delivering our commitments.  But with that, I'll turn it back to Yan, and we'll open it up for Q&A. Yan Jin : Okay. Good. Thanks, Craig. For the Q&A section today, please limit your question to one question and one follow up. Thanks in advance for your cooperation. With that, I will turn it to the operator to give you guys the instruction. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from the line of Andrew Obin from Bank of America. Andrew Obin : So yes, a question for Craig. The view among investors, right or wrong, is that we will see an economic downturn soon. So how would Eaton's Electrical incremental margins perform in an environment where the majority of revenue growth is from pricing versus sort of more normal periods was balance of volume and price contribution? Craig Arnold : Appreciate the question, Andrew. And I'd say the first of all, in general terms, in our company, we've always performed well in an economic downturn. And we know how to do a few things well. And certainly, one of those is we know how to flex the company in the event of an economic downturn and we typically perform much better from a decremental basis than we do, certainly on an incremental basis. And in a typical recession, we would see some 20% to 25% decremental performance in our business. And I don't think that our Electrical business will be largely different than that. I think that, at this point, as I mentioned, we're not anticipating a reduction in growth in our business even in the event of a typical mild recession, we think our company and certainly our Electrical business will continue to grow. You saw some of those order numbers, the backlog numbers that we talked about, our negotiation pipeline has never been stronger. And so we think that the company overall as a result of a lot of portfolio-related changes that we've made as a result of these secular growth trends performs well in the -- even in the event of an economic downturn. But if there is one, we have a playbook. We understand what we need to do in the event of an economic slowdown that impacts our revenue. We have projects identified ready to go if we end up in that scenario, but that is certainly not our base case. But I'd say you could think about 20% to 25% decrementals in the event of slowdown, a material slowdown. Andrew Obin : Great. And then just a follow-up, maybe just speaks why you're confident, but can we just get your initial view on Senator Manchin news and potential additional $370 billion on spend on energy security? Like how meaningful could this be for Eaton's end market? And more broadly, have you started to see orders tied to U.S. and the U.S. stimulus bills, which both have sizable energy infrastructure spending levels? Craig Arnold : Yes. I mean I'd say the compromise that Manchin and the other members of the -- certainly House have come up with at this point would be certainly positive for our company. If you think about where those dollars are going to go in whether it's energy transition, whether it's related to EVs, whether it's related to building out some of our critical infrastructure, water, wastewater, airports, I mean, it is certainly a net positive for our company overall. And I'd say that at this juncture, we've not factored obviously any of that in. That becomes naturally an additional tailwind for the company. All of these spending bills obviously need to go through the final approvals and ultimately be signed off on by the President. But I'd say from a timing standpoint, that really becomes largely a '23, '24 kind of tailwind for the company overall as are most of the stimulus-related projects. Very seldom do you have a stimulus bill approved that results in any near-term impact on revenue, but it's certainly all very positive for the long-term growth outlook, especially in our Electrical business where we'll see most of these benefits. Andrew Obin : And any impact from what's been passed already? Are you starting to see it in the numbers? Or it's just robust numbers reflect a lot of it already? Craig Arnold : Yes. No, I'd say at this juncture, on the margin, there have been some minor projects, I'd say, Andrew, that we've seen some benefit from. But most of this stuff, I'd say, maybe you get something in the fourth quarter, minor, but you don't really get to any material impact from most of these stimulus measures until you really get into '23 and some of them actually extend out into '24, depending upon the type of project and the lead time. But all positive, all net positive for the company. Operator : The next question is from Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research. Ryan Cooke : This is Ryan Cooke on for Nigel. So just expanding more on the Electrical Americas segment, could you just talk a little bit about what might have changed during the quarter? Have you seen improvements in supply chain bottlenecks or factory labor productivity? Craig Arnold : Yes. I'd say that really strong quarter, as we talked about in our Electrical Americas segment. And I'd say that with respect to supply chain, we had been very constrained really across the board. And during the course of the quarter, certainly, some of the important commodities for us, whether it's copper, steel, aluminum, some of the logistics and supply chain-related issues that we've been dealing with during the course of the year have gotten materially better. We still have pretty significant issues when it comes to electronic components and anything that's semiconductor based. And so we're certainly not out of the woods there. We do expect to see some modest improvement in the second half of the year, but really likely going to be sometime into the latter part of '23 before most of those issues resolve themselves. And so I'd say that in the Americas business, the big message here is that our end markets are very strong across the board and it's the growth in our end markets that it's allowing our business to perform as well as it is. Ryan Cooke : Okay. That's great. And then just shifting gears for my follow-up on the Aerospace segment. Could you just dig into a little more looking at the growth in commercial versus military and OEM versus aftermarket? I know that you mentioned an uptick in defense spending over the next few years. So I guess just touching on that and any other supply constraints that we should be thinking of in the back end of the year? Craig Arnold : First of all, I'd say that just as you think about our Aerospace business with the acquisition of Cobham, we're now balanced about 50-50 between commercial and defense. As we talked about in some of my outbound commentary, we're seeing a very strong recovery on the commercial side of the business, both in the aftermarket as well as in the OEM side. And so -- but still, as I mentioned, well below pre-COVID levels that we experienced back in 2019. And so we still have a long way to go on the commercial side, but those businesses in those markets are performing well, and we expect to see them continue to recover over the next few years or so. And on the defense side, we really come into the year with an expectation of those markets being flat to up slightly. And quite frankly, with some of the conflicts that are happening around the world, we've already seen, certainly, the Europeans commit to increasing their defense spending. We saw a defense budget in the U.S. come in higher than what was originally anticipated. So we do believe that even on the defense side of the equation, that we think that the defense markets will grow more favorably over the next few years than we were thinking certainly coming into the year. And so I think aerospace is another one of these businesses that's really poised for, let's say, cyclical growth on the commercial side and giving some of the geopolitical challenges in the world, defense spending is likely to go up around the world. And so we're feeling very good about the way we're positioned in Aerospace, and I think that's going to be an attractive market for us for some years to come. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Scott Davis from Melius Research. Scott Davis : It all sounds super positive, in fact, almost too positive. I have to ask the question, is there -- do you have a sense of where inventories are at in each of your key end markets and if there's a little bit of a buildup going on there? Craig Arnold : Yes. I mean I could certainly appreciate kind of the thought, Scott, that it all feels positive. In some cases, too positive, we want to pinch ourselves sometimes as well because, I mean, the facts and the data would suggest that things are good right now. I mean, as you heard, as I talked about, the strength in our orders across the board, in our Electrical business. And then you factor on top of that a cyclical recovery in aerospace, higher defense spending given the geopolitical events and quite frankly, even in the vehicle market, given the level of inventory, you mentioned a question around inventory. Inventory levels in the passenger car market around the world are at historically low levels. And so even in the event of an economic slowdown, you have to rebuild inventories in the channel. And certainly, there's a lot of rebuilding that needs to take place in global vehicle markets around the world. Then you have eMobility, which is a real growth vector for the company that's just starting to become a more material part of the organization. So we have a little -- we have a lot of really positive things going for the organization. To the specific question on inventory in the channel, I think that's probably likely an electrical question. I'd say there -- we test for that as well because we're obviously concerned about is there inventory being built up in the channel? Is there double ordering taking place? And every time we test for it, the answer comes back the same, not at all the case. And in fact, the channel today doesn't have as much inventory as they'd like, especially in products like circuit breakers. We'll oftentimes answer this question around double ordering. And keep in mind that in our Electrical business that 75% of what we do in Electrical is project-based. I mean it's -- nobody goes out and replaces their electrical circuit breakers or their panel boards because there's a new color coming out, right? So it's all tied to a project that our distributors and customers are ordering products for. And so we have a lot of confidence that the backlog, up some 89% in the Americas, is solid. We do -- we would expect a slowdown. I mean, you can't continue to grow at these levels for an indefinite period and the base effect, obviously, you can be comping some much bigger numbers as we move forward and into next year. But the markets are actually quite good right now. Thomas Okray : Yes. And Scott, just to add a little bit more color to that pinch-me story. I mean if you look in the Electrical business in both sales as well as orders, every single one of our end markets was up significantly. And within those end markets, some of them growing significantly more. So it's really strength across the board. Operator : The next question is from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski from Morgan Stanley. Joshua Pokrzywinski : Craig, just wanted to ask about Electrical Americas margins. They're pretty impressive here, and I would presume still kind of primed for health for metals deflation maybe later this year or into next year. Where should we think about as sort of the ceiling on those maybe over the next kind of 12, 18 months? Or maybe said differently, how high are you willing to let those go before you start kind of really putting the pedal to the foreign reinvestment? Craig Arnold : Yes. No, I'd say that we are reinvesting -- maybe we take the second end of that question first, and we are absolutely reinvesting in the business and reinvesting at a rate that's higher than we've ever invested. Our R&D spending was up in the quarter quite materially and we'll continue to invest. And so we are not in any way holding back on investments. As you think about -- we talk about the really important secular growth trends that we're looking in the face of energy transition, digitalization, electrification. Every one of these initiatives requires R&D. We're investing in capitalizing and building new factories to support this growth outlook that we have and so we're clearly investing in the business. To the point on margins and how high can they go and when do we become concerned, I'd say that we've set long-term margin targets for the business. And what we've done historically, our practice is you deliver those targets and then you think about the next raise. And so I'd say at this point, once we get to that plateau and consistently deliver these longer-term targets, which I believe we said were 22% for the Electrical Americas business, I mean we'll then as we took -- we do every year as we think about it in our investor meeting, we'll take a look at whether or not it's appropriate to raise those numbers. But I would say that the -- if you think about even our execution performance today, we have a lot of inefficiencies that we're absorbing today in the business. As you can manage some of these supply chain issues have created fairly significant disruptions in our plants and our facilities. And so we're not operating today anywhere close to our peak efficiency. And so there is room to raise margins by disimproving our execution, working through some of these supply chain issues and getting some of the inefficiencies out. So I'd say that we're not near the top in terms of controlling our own destiny, independent of what happens in the marketplace. Thomas Okray : Just one nuance on investment. We're also -- in addition to R&D., we're investing in selling resources as well. And to the doing better, I mean, if you look at our distribution, our freight, we're doing a lot less than truckload because of our supply disruption. So definitely can get a lot better. Joshua Pokrzywinski : Got it. That's helpful. And then hard not to notice that on the orders front, you guys have sort of comped the comp at this point in terms of that big step-up in the order comps kind of post pandemic. Attributable to any specific end markets, you kind of mentioned pretty broad-based growth, but trying to tease out if there's any specific market that kind of drove that that performance versus the comp or if price played kind of an unusual role. Craig Arnold : No, I'd say that on the order side, these big numbers that we're talking about, and we'd love to think that we're getting 25% to 30% price, but trust me, it's nowhere close to those numbers. And so this is just real economic activity. It's real volume in the order growth. And as we talked about really strong order growth in data centers, really strong order growth in the utility markets, really strong order growth in many cases, even in commercial which is a segment that people were concerned about. Thomas Okray : Residential as well. Craig Arnold : Yes. And even resi. I mean, in resi, at some point will turn. But despite all of the gloom and doom that's been forecasted in resi, we had very strong orders and very strong sales growth in the quarter in resi as well. Operator : The next question is from John Walsh from Credit Suisse. John Walsh : I wanted to build on that Electrical Americas line of questioning. Just trying to conceptualize what backlog up 89% year-over-year really means? Kind of how much of that gives you visibility already into next year, I've always thought of that as kind of a shorter cycle. And then maybe just anything around what the price looks like in that backlog because I would assume that's going to be a margin tailwind as you deliver it. Craig Arnold : No, I appreciate the question. I mean it's 89% increase in the backlog, we think, is a reflection, as we talked about, clearly, we have strong markets. The other thing that we believe and we've seen evidence that's taking place is that we probably we're not getting orders that we would not have gotten otherwise. But we're probably getting orders today a little earlier in the project than we would historically receive them. So I do believe some of this backlog is a function of the fact that you're going to get that order in October if that order maybe you're getting now in September. So the orders are coming in a little earlier than they would have. But it is good news in terms of visibility. I mean it certainly gives us -- it's certainly visibility into projects and gives us a lot more confidence as we think about 2023. And to your point, a lot of these projects will be delivered in 2023. Even if we wanted to deliver them this year, we don't have the capacity in our operations to do it. And so we do have perhaps better visibility than we've ever had going into 2023 at this point in the year.  And to the question on price, I don't expect the price in the backlog to have a material impact on margins. I think reflected in our margin guidance is very much consistent with the underlying margin performance that we're seeing in the business today. You saw we posted a very strong number in the second quarter of 23-plus percent in the Americas segment. So I would not expect this backlog to be delivering accretive margins to kind of the underlying assumptions that we have, even in the implied number, 22.7%, 22.8% in the second half of the year. But in many cases, we have had to go out and reprice the backlog. And that's part of -- one of the things that we're certainly seeing the benefit of today or certainly not seeing a drag on margins as a result of commodity versus price. Operator : And the next question is from Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Joseph Ritchie : Yes. So maybe just parsing out those price volume comments a little bit. How much of the organic growth this quarter was price? And then, Craig, as you kind of think about the second half of the year and the impact that price cost has to the business, like how -- what kind of like positive impact are you expecting to see either on a dollar basis or from a margin perspective versus the first half? Craig Arnold : I appreciate the question, and we've been asked this one before in terms of really separating price versus volume. And Joe, one of the things we said is that because we're in so many different businesses and so many of our different businesses have really different makeups that we would not have given out a number, and we're not going to do that today either in terms of price versus volume, I will tell you that we are getting significant contributions from both certainly in our results as well as in our order outlook. And I'd say in terms of price versus cost, I'd say today, if you think about it on an all-in basis, we are now as a company on the plus side, which I mentioned in my commentary. And some of our businesses, we still have some work to do to catch up, as we mentioned, in the Vehicle business where today, we are recovering inflation. For the most part, we're not getting margin on inflation. And as a result, it's compressing our return on sales. So -- and I'd say as we look forward, we would not expect price versus commodities to basically be -- have a positive impact on our overall segment margins. Joseph Ritchie : Okay. Helpful. Craig. And just my quick follow-on question, since no one's asked it. Like the demand trends have all sounded really good. Clearly, there's a lot of concern around Europe. And so I'm just wondering, just on the margin, can you maybe provide some additional color on what you're seeing specifically across your end markets in Europe? Craig Arnold : Yes. And I appreciate the question. And I can say we're certainly watching all of the same macro issues. We're watching, obviously, the impact that the war in Ukraine is having and concerned about what that could potentially do to demand. Having said that, we had a good quarter in Europe, both in our sales as well as in our orders, which continue to be quite strong through Q2 every place, I'd say, in markets other than perhaps in our Vehicle business, which is where I mentioned that our sales were essentially flat. But outside of the Vehicle business, Europe for us, continues to perform well and hold up better than what you would expect, given all of the issues that they're dealing with. And so we remain quite frankly, optimistic about Europe as we look forward. We're going to be prepared like we always are in the event that things turn down. But so far, orders continue to hang in there. And as I mentioned, the strength in the electrical markets, and we're seeing strength every place in these end markets. It's not just in the Americas. We're seeing the same types of strength in Europe as well, in data centers, in commercial markets, these markets are strong there as well. Operator : And the next question is from Stephen Volkmann from Jefferies. Stephen Volkmann : Just a couple of end market questions for me as well. Can you just give us a little color on what you're seeing in sort of the real heavy industrial Crouse-Hinds kind of harsh and hazardous type end markets? Craig Arnold : Yes. I mean those markets are doing well. And we talk about what's happening in our global business, and that's where we report Crouse-Hinds and oil and gas, industrial. And Crouse-Hinds business is performing very well. I mean I would tell you that we're still well below the peak in that business. If you think back to what took place back in the '08, '09 timeframe and so those markets, I'd say, are still below those levels, but we're certainly seeing strong double-digit growth in that side of the business as well. And we would expect to see that continue for some time to come, given the broader issues that we're dealing with, the macro issues and the availability of reliable sources of energy, whether that comes from some of the renewables or whether that be more traditional sources, I think the reality is, as we think about the implications of what's happening today in Europe, we're going to see more investment on both sides. We're going to see more investment in renewables. We're going to see more investment in more traditional sources of energy and both of those are good things for the growth outlook for our industrial businesses and specifically to our Crouse-Hinds business. Thomas Okray : Yes. Crouse is another one of our businesses that it's just broad across the board as well. If you look at all of our end markets, up significantly in sales this quarter. Stephen Volkmann : Super. And then on data centers, I assume that's one where you have a little bit more lead time visibility as well. Anything to call out there relative to sort of size of the data centers or locations or just anything to call out? Craig Arnold : No, no, other than to say that data center markets continue to be very strong. I'd say if we take a look at our order growth specifically, our order growth on a rolling 12-month basis in data centers was up some 25% in the quarter. And we're really seeing strength everywhere around the world in data centers. And so I mean, it's one of these markets that we think is going to be really positive for the company. It's -- I think on a current basis, it's maybe some 18%, 19% of the business, in our Electrical business comes from data centers. And so it's an important segment for us overall. And it's one that just continues to grow. And I personally believe as the world just continues to consume increasing amounts of data as there's more edge computing and autonomous vehicles, I think the data center is one of these markets that's going to be a very attractive market for some time to come. Operator : Our next question is from Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Julian Mitchell : Maybe just a first question perhaps for Tom. Just to try and understand the free cash flow here. Because I think the guidance at the midpoint implies a sort of 70%, 80% increase year-on-year in the second half to hit the free cash flow guide. Maybe just help us sort of bridge that, how much you're attributing to sort of earnings versus -- underlying earnings versus working capital versus any sort of onetime repeats or non-repeats just to try and bridge that big increase? Thomas Okray : Sure. Thanks for the question, Julian. First of all, let me take a step back and look at our cash conversion cycle. The DSO was slightly favorable. DPO was favorable. Where we've really made an investment is in our inventory, our days on hand. And this is an intentional choice to make sure that we are protecting the significant growth that we've been talking about on the call as well as being prepared for our customers with the choppiness as it relates to the supply disruption. As it relates to the second half versus the first half, historically, we generate significantly more free cash flow in the second half of the year than we do in the first half. So we think the second half is going to get better, and we feel comfortable with our guide right now. Julian Mitchell : And so is the view that -- yes, there'll be a very substantial inventory kind of liquidation in the back half, is that the sort of the biggest lever behind earnings driving that cash flow up? Thomas Okray : Well, I don't want to talk about that hypothetically right now. We're going to balance that, obviously, with order flow and what's happening with supply chain. But potentially, we will be liquidating some working capital in the back half of the year. Craig Arnold : Yes. If you think about it, Julian, I'd say that today, as I mentioned in some of my commentary, we just have an enormous number of inefficiencies that we're dealing with right now in our operations because of supply chain disruption. And as you can imagine, it only takes one component, could be a very inexpensive component, that prevents you from shipping a very large piece of electrical and expensive piece of electrical switch gear. And so we're clearly in some cases, as Tom talked about, consciously putting some inventory in to protect customers to deal with the forward demand. When you look at these orders increase when you look at our backlog, but some of this is also just inefficiencies as a result of all of the supply chain disruptions that we've been living with. Thomas Okray : Yes. Craig Arnold : And so we clearly. And I would be disappointed -- and I know my team is listening on the call if we don't do a much better job in DOH in the second half of the year. Thomas Okray : Absolutely. Absolutely. And I mean just an anecdotal related to the supply disruption, we've got a lot of work-in-process inventory in our factories. And we're waiting for those one or two components to come in so we can ship the product. That also creates disruption in terms of the labor and the manufacturing. So yes, there's a lot of improvement that we can do in the second half of the year, and we're on it. Julian Mitchell : That's helpful. And then just a quick follow-up. The Vehicle segment, so I think the sales are guided there to be up high teens or something in the back half year-on-year organically. Maybe just help us understand sort of how much is that sustained growth in truck, if you like, versus a big turnaround in light vehicle? Any kind of color on the different growth outlook between those two? Craig Arnold : Yes. Appreciate the question, Julian. I'd say what we've actually done in terms of the commercial truck market, we've actually taken our outlook down. We had anticipated that North America truck market would be roughly 305,000 units in our prior guidance. We now think it's going to be closer to 294,000. So we've actually taken the truck piece down but we -- but certainly, a lot of the growth is really a return, first of all, in China. I mean China, as you know, was essentially shut down for much of Q2. And we have a very sizable business in our vehicle business in China. And then you have a lot of these supply chain disruptions that have been especially difficult in the light vehicle market, and many of those are starting to abate. And so we're anticipating that the light vehicle market will see much better performance in the second half than in the first half. Operator : The next question is from Nicole DeBlase from Deutsche Bank. Nicole DeBlase : Just maybe circling back to the electrical order activity. Can you just comment, Craig, on what you guys have been seeing with respect to like large projects versus the shorter cycle component of orders? Craig Arnold : Yes. I'd say that quite frankly, I don't have that piece of data at my fingertips, Nicole, in general around kind of stratifying the various project sizes and we'll get back to you at the end and the team get back to you more specifically on the project side. But I would say, just to kind of restate a point that we're making, we're seeing broad-based strength every place across the board in our Electrical business. And as I mentioned, even on our negotiations, which has obviously comes before an order, our negotiations are up some 50% versus last year and some 20% versus Q1. And so we're really just seeing broad-based strength in the Electrical business. And we'll have to wait and see what the exact data sets, but tough to imagine that we're not seeing it in large, medium and small projects, but we'll get you the data. Thomas Okray : Yes. And on those negotiations, we're seeing growth in both commercial and industrial, both very strong versus last year and the previous quarter. Nicole DeBlase : That's great to hear. And then just as a quick follow-up, I guess, market volatility has obviously picked up. How are you guys feeling about the M&A pipeline and maybe the potential for continued bolt-ons in this sort of a macro environment? Craig Arnold : Yes. No, as we said and certainly reflected in our guidance this year with respect to a relatively modest share buyback that it was our intention to really to prioritize M&A this year. And as we look forward, as we looked at the pipeline of opportunities that the teams are looking at, and we still believe that, that's the right call. Valuations, in some cases, have still held up despite the fact that the market has retreated. As you know, it always takes a little time between the market retrenchment and rising interest rates and what that does to future earnings before sellers internalize that. So I'd say we're still working with some opportunities that we think could be interesting. But obviously, no announcements to make today, but it's certainly still a key priority for the company. Operator : The next question is from Brett Linzey from Mizuho. Brett Linzey : Just wanted to come back to pricing and specifically stickiness. Just in terms of the compounding price we've seen in the industry for the last several quarters, are you getting any push back at all from distribution? And then, I guess, would it be a fair assessment that some of the larger investments around solutions that have a payback, you tend to hold price historically better. I'm just curious how you see that playing out in a deflationary environment. Craig Arnold : Yes. The first thing I would acknowledge is that this inflationary environment is not like any that we've ever seen in our lifetimes. And so we'll have to wait and see how it all plays through. But having said that, and to the point that you raised, historically speaking, price has been very sticky in our business. And as you know, because we go to market through distribution, distributors like price, gives them an opportunity to revalue inventories. And as long as the world continues to hang in there, it tends to be a good thing for our distributors as well. And today, I don't know what is it, some 70% of our business goes through distribution. And so I'd say that what we would generally expect in our business is that price to be very sticky. And we're obviously seeing a little bit of retrenchment and commodity costs on the material side. But having said that, labor costs are up, the logistics costs are up, energy costs are up. And so we're just seeing a lot of inflation in almost every aspect of the economy, that I would say that even if commodity costs come off a little bit, these other factors are going to keep prices and inflation at probably higher levels than you would probably imagine at first blush. So I'd say long story short, we think it's going to be fairly sticky, which is consistent with the way it's behaved historically. Brett Linzey : No, I appreciate that. And just a follow-up, you talked about some of the R&D and selling force additions you've made. But could you just talk about capital investment and enhancing capacity to capture some of these secular trends? Are you selectively investing in kind of brick-and-mortar and new capacity? And then where is the current plant utilization for your Electrical business? Craig Arnold : Yes. I'd say the short answer to the question is absolutely yes. We are, in fact, making investments in brick-and-mortar to deal with this -- the secular growth trends that we see coming, to deal with the strong order growth that we have already as well as our outlook for future years. And so we are having to make capital investments principally to your point, in our Electrical business. And so we're making those investments today. We'll continue to make them in the future. And I think it's a reflection of the confidence that we have that these markets are going to play out as we expected. And both in R&D, which I talked about originally to come up with products and solutions, to come up with digital offerings and solutions that we're selling into these markets, to deal with some of the new technology that we're investing in, to be ready for energy transition and building out the electrical charging infrastructure across the U.S. and the rest of the world. And so we're definitely in an investment cycle and putting more capital into the business today than we probably have in many, many years. I'd say... Brett Linzey : Very encouraging... Craig Arnold : In Aerospace and Vehicle it\u2019s largely different. We have -- we really have the investments we need there because we're still well below peak volume levels. But in the Electrical business, without a doubt, we're making big investments in capacity expansion. Operator : The next question is from Deane Dray from RBC Capital Markets. Deane Dray : Just covered a lot of ground here, but I was interested in having you expand on the point about circuit breaker scarcity because that's one of your core businesses. And my guess is it's directly related to semiconductor shortages. But we have heard from a number of companies this quarter talking about kind of gradual improvement and semiconductor availability. How has that badly impacted you all on the electrical side and then specifically in circuit breakers? Craig Arnold : No, you're absolutely right, Deane. The places where we're having the biggest challenges right now is on anything that takes a microprocessor and increasing what we're finding in the world of circuit protection, whether that's in a residential home or whether that's in a commercial and industrial building, the intelligent circuit breakers are in demand. They're growing at a faster rate, and that's where we have been challenged, certainly, up to this point this year. And I'd say, as we look forward, we have -- things have gotten better. We have basically crawled and circled the earth trying to find every available circuit breaker that we -- of electrical component that we can find. In many cases, buying stuff from distributor markets at very high prices, by the way. And so things have definitely improved. But I would say by no means are we out of the woods when it comes to shortness of supply, when it comes to anything that has an electronic component. Lead times have gone out pretty dramatically, and we continue to have shortages. One of the reasons why our backlog is growing at the rate that it's growing is that we just don't have the ability to serve all the demand that we're seeing. And so on the one hand, you have demand that's as good as it's ever been. On the other hand, you have an industry that probably underinvested. And as a result -- and then you have all these other supply chain disruptions that we've been dealing with around China and now in parts of Europe to the war as well that are exacerbating things. So I'd say, in short, it's getting better, but by no means that we're out of the woods. Yan Jin : Okay. Thanks, guys. We have reached the end of the call, and we do appreciate everybody dialing in to ask questions. As always, Chip and I will be available to address you guys' follow-up questions. Thank you. Have a good day. Operator : Thank you, and that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Event Conference. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I'll turn the call now over to your host, Yan Jin, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Yan Jin : Hi, good morning. Thank you for joining us for Eaton's third quarter 2022 earnings call. With me today are Craig Arnold, our Chairman and CEO; and Tom Okray, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer. Our agenda today, including the opening remarks by Craig, then he will turn it over to Tom, who will highlight the company's performance in the third quarter. As we have done on our past calls, we'll be taking questions at end of Craig's closing commentary. The press release and the presentation we'll go through today have been posted on our website. This presentation includes adjusted earnings per share, adjusted free cash flow and other non-GAAP measures. They're reconciled in the appendix. A webcast of this call is accessible on our website and will be available for replay. I would like to remind you that our comments today will include the statements related to the expected future results of the company and are therefore forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our forecasted projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and the presentation. With that, I will turn over to Craig. Craig Arnold : Thanks, Yan. We'll begin with the highlights of the quarter on Page 3, and I'll start by noting that we delivered another very strong quarter and have again posted a number of all-time records, including adjusted earnings per share of $2.02, which is up 15% from prior year. This, despite negative impact of FX and the divested Hydraulics business, which took place in August of 2021. Our organic revenue growth also continued to accelerate in the quarter, up 11% in Q2 to up 15% in Q3. And I think, encouragingly, we had strength across all of our businesses with exceptional growth in Electrical Americas, in Vehicle and eMobility. We also posted all-time segment margins of 21.2%, up 130 basis points over prior year and above the high end of our guidance with incrementals of 38% in the quarter. I'd also note that our team continues to manage price effectively more than fully offsetting the impact of inflation. As noted here, orders continued to accelerate in the quarter as well. On a rolling 12-month basis, Electrical orders increased 27% versus 25% last quarter, and our Aerospace orders increased 22% compared to 19% last quarter. This order strength, I'd say, also led to another quarter of record backlogs in Electrical, which were up some 75%, and our Aerospace backlogs increased by 17%. Lastly, we did start to generate positive momentum in our cash flow results. We had a strong year-on-year performance with operating cash up 29% and a 30% increase in free cash flow. And our free cash flow as a percentage of sales was 15.6% in the quarter. So as expected, we're starting to see improved cash flow from both higher earnings and improved working capital performance. Moving to Page 4. And before I turn things over to Tom to go through the quarterly results, I want to highlight a few of the key themes that are really underpinning our confidence in our long-term growth outlook. As noted here, we continue to benefit from the 3 secular growth trends that we reviewed earlier : electrification, energy transition and digitalization. And while still in the early stages, we booked some $700 million of new wins in the quarter that are directly tied to these trends. Within electrification, you've all read the announcements of the very large number of manufacturing projects in the U.S. that includes new semiconductor facilities, big investments in new electric vehicle manufacturing plants, new EV battery investments and investments in EV charging infrastructure. In fact, there's been some $1.3 trillion of new projects announced this year alone. And the impact of stimulus bill is yet to show up in these numbers. These incentives will point towards large investments that are tied to improving electrical infrastructure and will deliver significant benefits over the next few years. The next large growth driver is energy transition. The move away from fossil to renewables that's taken place for a number of years now, and this trend will only accelerate. And with every renewable resource addition, it requires electrical infrastructure. But it's not just, I'd say, connecting power to the grid, it's also investments in technology to keep the grid stable, to manage different sources of electrical power, investments in batteries to store excess energy, and these are all products and services that we naturally provide. Beyond renewables, we're also seeing an increase in investments relating to improving grid resiliency, which has become a priority due to extreme weather events and really the demand for a need for energy independence. And lastly, our emerging digital society will drive higher selling prices as we add intelligence to our legacy products. We'll sell new value from data and insights and create new software solutions, all of which require data centers, an important growth segment for Eaton. These I\u2019d say are just a few of the reasons why we remain confident in our electrical businesses and their ability to deliver higher levels of organic growth for some years to come. And Slide 5 reflects we have a number of attractive growth drivers in our industrial businesses as well. I'll begin with the most notable one, vehicle electrification. Here, the outlook for EV penetration continues to accelerate but with new announcements coming almost every week. And I\u2019d say here, not just in passenger cars, we're also seeing increasing need for electrification projects in commercial vehicles, some for the entire system but often for a subsystem of the vehicle. And I'd also note here the opportunities we're seeing tied to the acquisition of Royal Power are much larger than we anticipated, and our eMobility pipeline continues to be very robust. Just as a point of reference, our opportunity per vehicle on an EV is some 18x higher than the opportunity that we have on a traditional internal combustion engine. And you'll recall, we expect our eMobility segment to become $2 billion to $4 billion in revenue over the next number of years. The next growth driver is tied to what we're doing in our legacy Vehicle business, which is finding new applications for existing technology. We're seeing a number of new opportunities for our commercial engine brake technology, for our mechanical gears that are used in electric vehicles and for our advanced valve train actuation technology. And in all 3 cases, we've already booked significant new wins here. Third, we're benefiting from the aerospace industry growth cycle, which, over the next several years, will continue to accelerate. Commercial passenger growth has continued to improve and it's translating into significant growth in commercial aftermarket orders, which, by the way, were up some 40% year-to-date. And commercial OEM build rates are forecasted to grow some 15% over the next 4 years. Lastly, I'd note that with our acquisitions of Souriau and Mission Systems, we expect to see even better growth given our position on high-growth platforms and as we begin to realize sales synergies. Overall, just stepping back from this particular set of initiatives, we've delivered some $250 million of wins in industrial. And when added to what we noted in Electrical, we delivered almost $1 billion of growth tied to the secular growth trends in our markets. So with that, what I'd like to do at this point is turn it over to Tom and ask him to walk through the quarterly results. Tom Okray : Thanks, Craig. I'll begin with noting a few key points regarding our Q3 results. Our revenue was up 8% with organic growth of 15%, partially offset by a 4% foreign exchange headwind and a 3% unfavorable net impact of acquisitions and divestitures. Related to the acquisitions and divestitures, the acquisition of Royal Power increased revenue by 1% while the sale of Hydraulics reduced revenues by 3% -- by 4%, sorry, for a net of 3%. With total revenue growth of 8%, we posted solid operating leverage with 15% growth in both operating profit and adjusted EPS. It's worth noting that the foreign exchange headwind of 4% had an $0.08 impact on adjusted EPS, which was larger than our 3% guidance estimate. Further, growth in adjusted EPS of 15% would have been 22%, excluding the $0.08 impact from FX and the $0.03 net impact from acquisitions and divestitures. All in, stronger organic growth and higher margins enabled us to report adjusted EPS of $2.02 that was above our guidance midpoint. Finally, as we did last quarter, we continue to raise the bar with all-time records in adjusted EPS, segment operating profit and segment margin. Moving to the next slide. Electrical Americas had another very strong quarter. We set all-time records for sales, operating profit and margin. Revenue growth accelerated to 18% organically driven by strength in all end markets, with particular strength in commercial and institutional, residential, industrial and utility end markets. Operating margin at 23.5% was up 180 basis points versus prior year, benefiting from higher volumes. With respect to price, we continue to manage price effectively to more than offset inflationary pressures in the segment. In addition, our demand continues to remain very strong. Orders on a rolling 12-month basis accelerated sequentially, coming in at 36% year-over-year versus 29% in the prior quarter. Our orders were strong across the board, with particular strength in data center, utility and industrial end markets. These order growth translated into another record quarter of backlog, up 97%. On a sequential basis, backlog is up 14% versus the prior quarter. In addition to the robust trends in orders and backlog, our major project negotiations pipeline more than doubled year-over-year driven by especially strong growth in manufacturing, data center, industrial and utility end markets. Turning to Page 8. Electrical Global results were also very strong, generating a Q3 record for revenue and all-time records for operating profit and margin. Organic growth was up 13% with an 8% foreign exchange headwind. Notably, this is the sixth quarter in a row of double-digit organic revenue growth. We saw solid organic growth in all regions with particular strength in our global Crouse-Hinds B-Line business and solid growth in both Europe and Asia Pacific. We posted record segment margin of 20.6%, up 50 basis points year-over-year. Similar to Electrical Americas, higher volume was a margin tailwind versus the prior year, and we continue to manage price effectively to more than offset inflationary pressures. Orders were up 14% organically on a rolling 12-month basis with strength in commercial and institutional and industrial end markets. Backlog growth remained strong at up 22%. Before moving to our Industrial businesses, I'd like to briefly recap the very strong results of our combined Electrical segment. For Q3, we posted accelerating organic growth of 16%, incremental margin of 33% and operating margin of 22.3% with 130 basis points of year-over-year margin improvement. We also generated orders and backlog growth of 27% and 75%, respectively, with more than doubling of our negotiation pipeline in the United States. We remain very well positioned for profitable growth in our overall Electrical businesses. Our Aerospace segment results are captured on the next page. Aerospace also generated records in the quarter with an all-time sales revenue record and a Q3 operating profit record. Organic revenue increased 8% with 5% foreign exchange headwinds. Organic growth in the quarter was particularly strong in our commercial aftermarket and commercial OEM markets. Encouragingly, military aftermarket grew in the quarter. Operating margin of 24% was up 200 basis points from the prior year, benefiting from volume growth. On a rolling 12-month basis, our order acceleration continued, now 22% versus up 19% last quarter, including military OEM markets that were also up 22%. We saw order strength in all end markets as travel continues to accelerate within commercial markets and military orders strengthened consistent with our expectations for increased defense spending. Backlog remained strong with a 17% increase over prior year and up 5% sequentially. Moving on to our Vehicle segment. Organic revenue grew 19%. We also experienced a 3% headwind from FX. We had strength in the North America, South America and [EMEA] markets. Our North American light motor vehicle business was especially strong with nearly 25% organic growth, while our South American business was up more than 35%. Operating margin of 16.8% was down 120 basis points versus prior year primarily due to manufacturing inefficiencies. However, it's important to note improvement in our ability to offset higher inflationary cost with price. This is reflected in sequential margin improvement of 150 basis points from Q2. Incremental margins on a sequential basis were up nearly 50% with solid volume growth and continued progress on price cost. Moving to Page 11. We show results for our eMobility business. Revenues grew 63%, including 17% organic growth, 49% from the acquisition of Royal Power and 3% foreign exchange headwind. We continued the trend of narrowing the operating loss on a year-over-year basis. This quarter, operating margin improved 800 basis points driven by organic volume growth and the impact from the Royal Power acquisition. We are seeing continued momentum to achieve our $2 billion to $4 billion revenue target with new platform wins for power protection solutions, including additional Breaktor wins. Our opportunity pipeline remains robust for innovative power distribution, conversion and protection solutions. On the following slide, we have a summary of our guidance for the year. As noted on the chart, we are reaffirming 2022 organic growth and operating margin guidance in total. Further, we are reaffirming both metrics for all segments, except eMobility operating margin. More specifically, we continue to expect organic growth in the range of 11% to 13% and operating margin from 20% to 20.4%. Turning to Page 13. We show the balance of guidance for 2022. We're not making significant changes to our full year outlook. We tightened our adjusted EPS range of $7.51 to $7.61 per share from the prior guide of $7.36 to $7.76. Consistent with the foreign exchange headwinds that we mentioned throughout the presentation, we increased the unfavorable translation impact to $600 million from $450 million in our previous guide. Our full year expectations for the other items are unchanged. With respect to cash flow, orders and backlog have grown significantly more than our expectation. In addition, we have been and will continue to prioritize customers and profitable revenue growth at the expense of cash flow. Therefore, while we have good cash flow momentum in Q3, we have work to do to achieve our objectives. Shifting to Q4. Highlighting a few key points on our Q4 guidance. We expect adjusted EPS to be in the $2 and $2.10 range, organic growth to be between 13% and 15% and operating margin to be between 20.5% and 20.9%. Comparing to the prior year, adjusted EPS and operating margin guidance at the midpoint represents over 19% growth and 140 basis points increase, respectively. Now I will hand it back to Craig to walk us through a market outlook and wrap up the presentation. Craig Arnold : Thanks, Tom. Turning to Page 14. We provide an early look at our end market assumptions for 2023. And let me begin by saying that we are expecting to see a typical model recession next year but don't expect it will have a significant impact on our growth given the secular growth trends, the strong orders and the record backlog that we're sitting on. Within Electrical, data centers, industrial facilities and the utility market are all expected to see very good growth. Together, they account for approximately 40% of our total revenue and, quite frankly, have some of the strongest orders and backlogs in the company. As a point of reference, industrial projects announced this year so far are up some 300%. So you can see really strong momentum in these segments of the business. Commercial and institutional as well as machinery are expected to see more modest growth. Of note, orders in C&I continued to accelerate in the quarter with significant strength in government and institutional. And this is the segment where you'd imagine we expect to see significant benefits from stimulus spending. The one relatively weak segment is expected to be residential. And while we've not seen a downturn yet and our orders are up some [23%] on a rolling 12-month basis through Q3, we do expect the segment of next year. I would, however, note that resi only accounts for 7% of the total company sales and that residential new build market will be somewhat offset by the renovation market and the renovation market accounts for some 40% of our residential sales. And I'd also note that we'd expect to see higher electric content per home, which is what we've been seeing over the last number of years. Within our Industrial sector, we're expecting it to be a big year for electric vehicles. Increasing government regulations and incentives and the large number of new EV introductions will keep the segment strong quite frankly for years to come. And in commercial aerospace and light motor vehicle markets are both expected to see a cyclical recovery. The need to rebuild inventories will support vehicle markets and the aerospace aftermarket growth and the ramp-up in commercial OEM production will drive aerospace markets higher next year. Lastly, we expect commercial vehicle market to be flat but quite frankly at quite healthy levels. So in total, 85% of our markets are expected to see positive organic growth next year. We'll naturally provide more details on our specific organic growth assumptions on our February earnings call, but we did want to share our preliminary thinking and let you know that we expect 2023 to be another good year of growth for the company. And lastly, on Page 15, I'd like to close with maybe just a few points here. First, I'd say I'm pleased with our Q2 results, particularly with our strong margins, our earnings and our orders growth. We continue to manage the business well and delivered record profits despite ongoing supply chain challenges and inflationary environment, significant FX and interest headwinds. The transformation of the portfolio has delivered what we promised, a higher-quality company with higher growth, higher margins and better earnings consistency. And for the balance of the year, we remain on track to deliver our commitments, including record operating margins, adjusted -- and adjusted earnings per share. And we're doing so despite offsetting once again the significant headwinds that I talked about around FX, pension and interest, and these headwinds increase in Q4. As we look into next year, we remain optimistic despite our recession expectations. We do expect a slowdown, and we'll be prepared in the event of a more significant downturn. We know how to flex our costs and deliver attractive decrementals. But as we've said, we have good reasons for optimism. Second, the growth trends are driving strong momentum in our businesses, and we have a growing pipeline of opportunities. We're going into next year with strong momentum with record backlogs and with an expectation that many of the operational inefficiencies and supply chain disruptions will get materially better next year. So we feel great about the quarter, great about the outlook. And with that, we'll turn it back to you, Yan, for Q&A. Yan Jin : Thanks, Craig. [Operator Instructions] With that, I will turn it over to the operator to give you guys the instructions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question will be from Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank. Nicole DeBlase : Maybe can we just start with maybe going through expectations for 2023 incrementals. I know it's a bit early to be giving guidance, but you were kind enough to walk us through the end market outlook. And I'm just curious if you think that it's feasible to kind of be at your long-term guidance for incrementals, at least as a starting point. Let's start with that. Craig Arnold : I appreciate the question, Nicole. As you can imagine, we're working through our 2023 profit plans right now and have lots of activity going on and around the company to get prepared for that. But I would say that as you think about next year, I think kind of a 30% incremental rate would be kind of the right place to be thinking about running your models at this point. And we'll naturally be in a position by the time we get to the earnings call for Q4 in February to give you a more specific read on that. But we think 30% is probably a good planning number at this juncture. Nicole DeBlase : Got it. And then I guess what surprised me the most this quarter was just the huge acceleration in Electrical America orders. Definitely encouraging to see that even as comps get difficult. So maybe if you could dig a little bit more into what drove the Q-on-Q acceleration. Craig Arnold : Yes. As we've talked about and shared in some of the -- commentary, we've had pretty broad-based strength in orders in our Electrical business. I mean in the Americas specifically, data centers were extremely strong, industrial markets very strong, utility markets we had orders up some 60%. And so it really was broad-based. Even in the resi market on a rolling 12-month basis, even there, we had orders that were still up some 20%. And so it's tough at this point to really call out any particular market in the Americas that I'd say that was weak, but we had really, really strong strength. And I'd say a lot of it really is tied to these big trends we talked about. Obviously, the utility markets in general are certainly benefiting today from some of these investments in not only energy transition but grid resiliency, data centers. And I know there's been lots of debate about that market and which direction it is heading. But we're really continuing to see really strong strength in the data center market, even to the point where customers today are looking to place long-term commitments and basically hold the slot in our production plans out into 2024. So we continue to see very strong strength in our Americas business, once again, tied to these trends that we've been talking about for some time. And we're absolutely pleased to see it showing up in our orders and that will obviously convert to revenue as we have the ability to ship and we resolve some of the supply chain issues that we continue to deal with. Tom Okray : Yes. Just to amplify the data centers in the Americas, on a quarter-over-quarter basis, up almost 40% and on a trailing 12 months, over 50%. So we've been hearing noise on that of slowdown. We're not seeing it. Operator : Next to the line of Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Josh Pokrzywinski : Craig, on this order surge that you guys have seen, anything that you would attribute to timing around stimulus or lead times or anything else? Maybe a chunky order in there that we should think about as we look out? Because we are going to continue to see some tough comps here. And I know that with the rolling 12, it's always kind of hard to parse out maybe some of the quarter-to-quarter volatility. Craig Arnold : Yes. No. And we tried to provide a little bit of color because I know there's this question around whether or not -- what kind of growth you're seeing in orders in the quarter, which is why we try to share that not just in the rolling 12 but actually in the quarter, we're seeing significant strength. Those numbers that Tom quoted were actually in the quarter, quarter-over-quarter numbers despite to your point, tougher comps. I'd say in terms of the order surge question, as I mentioned in my commentary, there have been a number of very large projects announced. And I'd say, as you think about whether it's reassuring or investment in grid infrastructure or its investment in new battery facilities, there are today perhaps different than some of the other cycles that we've been through, a lot more very large industrial projects that tend to be more electrical-intensive as an application that we're certainly seeing in our backlog, and that's certainly helping us. But that also gives us a lot of confidence as well because these tend to be big multiyear projects that will go on for some time to come. Stimulus, to your question, not yet. We certainly would anticipate that at some point down the road that we'll start to see a meaningful impact from stimulus. Most of those programs are still probably 6 to 12 months away from really having a meaningful impact on the company. But once again, that\u2019s just another one of these vectors that we think will continue to give us a multiyear growth story that's pretty compelling. And as you know, a lot of those stimulus dollars are going directly into the markets in which we participate. It's about building out the electrical infrastructure. It's about grid resiliency. It's about energy transition. It's investments in efficiency -- and specifically -- at a point where they actually specify upgrading your electrical panel as particular parts of the program that qualify for these investments. And so it's just another one of these things, Josh, that gives us confidence in the long-term outlook of our Electrical business specifically. Tom Okray : And just a little more color on the major projects. In the U.S. manufacturing in the quarter, negotiations up over 300%. Data centers up over almost 170% and the year-to-date numbers are equally strong. So just really, really strong numbers on the major projects. Josh Pokrzywinski : Got it. That's helpful. And then just a quick follow-up on the stimulus piece or, I guess, broader infrastructure spending that you guys are tracking. I know there's some big dollars there. Obviously, not all of that is electrical, but as you touched on, a lot of things sort of get in to Eaton's backyard at some point. How would you think about what those do to your addressable market here as those start to enter? Is that like a 5% increase, a 30% increase to addressable market? Like any sort of ring fencing would be helpful. Craig Arnold : Yes. And I'd say maybe a little bit early for us to be able to put a handle on how it's going to impact specifically the relative opportunity or the relative growth. As you know, they are very big billion-dollar programs directly targeted at electrical infrastructure. But I would just say that at this point, Josh, we would hope to, at some point down the road, give you a better indicator of that. But it's just quite frankly, today, a little bit too early to see how this is going to all play out. But it's all going to be good. I mean it's all going to be things that are going to help us continue to accelerate our growth, not just in the next 12 months but quite frankly, these stimulus programs will help us accelerate growth over the next 3 to 4 years. Operator : Next, we'll go to Andrew Obins with Bank of America. Andrew Obin : Just a question. Can you just give us more color on data centers? I know you're very positive but just maybe talk about system protocols that have been debated -- Tom Okray : Andrew, we're getting some background noise. It's very hard to hear you. Craig Arnold : We heard data centers, Andrew, but we were -- Andrew Obin : Just give me one second. Let me try this. Is this better? Craig Arnold : Much better. Andrew Obin : Yes. So just on data centers, if we could just focus on different geographies and different verticals within the data center market is just -- there's a lot of noise regarding this market. What are you guys seeing? I know you're bullish, but just as I said, more color by geography and vertical. Craig Arnold : Yes. And I appreciate the question, Andrew. We certainly -- if you think about geographically, we're clearly seeing the strongest growth in the Americas market. Very strong growth in the Americas market, very strong growth in hyperscale but also in colo and on-prem. Maybe if you know today, I mean some -- I guess some 40% of the market would be hyperscale. So this really is broad-based strength that we're seeing in the data center market, certainly in the Americas. We're seeing good growth but not a strong growth in Europe and in Asia to markets that are also growing. Once again, the IT channel to really distinguish that from the broader data center market, we have seen that tend to be a little shorter cycle. And we have seen a little relative slower growth, still good growth but relatively slower growth in the IT channel, relatively slower growth in single phase in markets like Europe and Asia. But once again, we're still seeing growth in those markets. Andrew Obin : Great. And just on capital allocation, as interest rates have gone up, you are clearly cash generative. You're more of a strategic buyer. How has the market landscape changed from your perspective? And does it make more likely or less likely to see a deal from Eaton in the next 12 to 18 months? Craig Arnold : I would say that what's going on in the interest rate environment needs to at some point, translate into seller expectations on valuation. And I'd say there's always, as you know, a fairly significant lag between the realities of the market changing and company's expectations of what their value is. And so I'd say, in general, in these kinds of environments, you would expect asset valuations to come in a little bit. And that would therefore increase the likelihood of us doing transactions. But I would say today, it's early, and we really have not seen any material change at this point in valuations or expectations. But we continue to be out on the hunt looking for opportunities and still think that's the right priority for the company. But having said that, as we've said in the past, we will not overreach. We don't intend to overpay. We've been a very disciplined buyer, and we'll continue to be a very disciplined buyer. And in the event that asset valuations don't come in line with our expectations, we'll certainly use it as an opportunity to buy back our stock. Operator : And next, we'll go to Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Nigel Coe : Okay. So the 2023 end market outlook, it looks like if you had to pick a number, you'd say 5% to 6% type lender growth rates. The one, I guess I'm surprised by is the C&I market where you're looking for modest growth. It seems like the leasing -- there are really healthy. We got some stimulus money coming through. So just wondering, what's driving that view? Is it some collateral damage from residential? Is it Europe, Asia Pacific? Any color there would be great. Craig Arnold : I appreciate it -- we tried to kind of unpack that a little bit in my outbound commentary, but we're still seeing good growth in the C&I market. Orders on a rolling 12-month basis, by the way, globally, we're up 23% in the quarter. They were actually up 27%. And so actually, a very strong quarter with orders actually accelerating in the quarter. And I'd say on the commercial side, we're seeing growth, but we're seeing the biggest growth in what we call institutional and government. And as I noted in my commentary, that's really where you'd expect to see some of the early indications of some of the government dollars and government spending in and around institutional and government. But that market continues to do extremely well. And we really have not really seen any signs, particularly in that market of a letup. I think more generally speaking, the Americas as a region tends to be the strongest region in the world, really across most of these end markets. But we had a very strong quarter in Europe as well in the C&I market. Tom Okray : And in Asia also. Asia was very strong. in commercial and institution. Actually, all the end markets grew quite strong on a quarter-over-quarter and the trailing 12 months. I mean Europe was particularly strong in commercial as well as government on a trailing 12 month as well as on a quarter-over-quarter. Craig Arnold : I mean, so at some point, I mean, as somebody mentioned earlier, we're going to be anniversary-ing some really strong growth numbers. And we do expect these growth numbers to slow and moderate at some place in terms of the order intake. But also keep in mind, we're sitting on record backlogs that are up, in some cases up, more than 100%. And so even if you have a little bit of a slowdown in some of these end markets, which you'll likely see some of that, our backlogs today are giving us visibility into almost 60% of next year's demand. And that number is about 2x what we normally see. Nigel Coe : Right. Yes, that's it. I mean it all sounds great. Just wondering what changes in '23. But my follow-on question is on free cash flow. We've got a pretty big fourth quarter lined up in the plan. Growth rates remained really strong. So just wondering kind of the confidence and what needs to happen to drive that free cash flow. Tom Okray : Yes. No, I appreciate the question. We tried to touch on it in the prepared remarks. We had a very strong Q3 cash conversion cycle. We improved by 7 days. Days on hand went up 4 days, payables up another 2 days. So we felt really good about that. I think what we want to get in terms of the prepared remarks is to let you know we're going to prioritize taking care of the customer and protecting the orders and organic growth. Recognizing that, we've got work to do to hit our free cash flow objective. No question about it. Operator : Next, we'll go to Scott Davis with Melius Research. Scott Davis : I don't think I've heard a price -- a specific price number And not asking for anything particularly precise, it can be a range. But of that 15% core was -- it's been running typically kind of a little bit more than half in price. Is that about the same this quarter? Craig Arnold : Yes, Scott. As you know, we said in prior calls is that we haven't given out specifically between price and volume largely because there's such a huge variation depending upon the markets, the customers, the various commodities that we're selling. And so we haven't given out a number, but I would say that within that 15% growth, we had healthy growth in both volume and price. \u2013 Tom Okray : Strong growth in volume as well. Scott Davis : Do you guys have a sense of -- I mean your customers -- are they trying to build some inventory ahead of anticipated demand in '23? Are they trying to get ahead of some price increases? What is the incentive or are they just paranoid they're not going to be able to get product? I'm trying to just get my arms around the incentive to really order above actual end market growth because it's -- certainly your growth rates are above global GDP levels by quite some levels. Craig Arnold : Yes. First of all, I'd say our end markets are doing very well. And so a lot of what we're seeing today is, in fact, a reflection of just heightened industrial activity, heightened investments in manufacturing. We talked about these big investments in things like semiconductors, new plants for building EV factories and new factories for building batteries and investments in grid hardening. And so in many cases, the markets that we're participating in are really strong markets right now.  Having said that, I would say that our customers would like to build some more inventory, and that's -- and today, they're not. And we're not seeing any evidence at this point at all more broadly of overstocking in the distribution channel. There is some nervousness in the marketplace today around I need to get a place in line. And so as we mentioned before, we're probably getting orders a little bit earlier in the process than we would normally get an order. So we're getting more lead time. But in general, and you can see it in some of the distributor data as well, our distributors, their sales out are very strong. If you look at some of the big electrical distributors in the numbers that they reported. Operator : And we'll go to Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Julian Mitchell : I think just firstly, I wanted to focus on the fourth quarter for a second. So it looks like you're assuming kind of flattish sales sequentially and margins down maybe 50 bps or so. It seems like that's very concentrated in the aerospace division, where there's kind of a big margin reversal versus what you saw in the third quarter. Maybe just clarify that, please, on ARO and if there's anything else kind of going on sequentially on margins in the segments. Craig Arnold : Yes. I mean as you know, Joe, we had a really strong quarter in Aerospace in Q3. And as you know from this business, so much of how you perform in Aerospace is really a function of the mix of your aftermarket versus OE sales. And so in any given quarter, you can have a very different mix that certainly will push your margins around one way or another, but the margin levels as is implied and -- are still very strong in aerospace and very much in line with our guidance for the year. But in any given quarter, you can, in fact, see a little bit of difference depending upon how much OEM business you're shipping. And with the ramp, in OEMs and some of our major customers, you probably -- embedded in that numbers are probably more OEM shipments than we would typically see or certainly we saw as a mix or as a percentage in Q3. But by and large, the business is doing well. Backlog is growing. Profitability is doing well. Team is executing well. And so we have no concerns about aerospace. We think the business is in great shape. Julian Mitchell : And then just my follow-up, I suppose, would be around kind of volume growth. As you said, it's been healthy in the third quarter. So assuming it's up, let's say, mid-single digit. As you think about the backlog from here as supply constraints ease, do you think we see an incremental kind of acceleration in backlog conversion into revenues? And so your volume growth could accelerate in the next few quarters even as sales slow down. Maybe just help us understand kind of that work through of orders into revenue volumes as supply chains are moving around? Craig Arnold : I appreciate the question, and it's what we've been chasing, really drilling for at least the last 12 months where we -- quite frankly, we need a little bit of a slowdown, quite frankly, in orders just to catch our breath and try to deal with some of these backlogs that we're building in the business. And so I'd say that, yes, it's absolutely possible that you can have a scenario where just working off the backlog in the past dues gives you the ability to continue to grow your business despite what could be a bit of a slowdown in the marketplace. So that's entirely possible. And quite frankly, we need the ability to take a little bit of a breather to execute on some of this backlog. But to date, as you saw in our results, I mean the orders keep coming, and they keep coming fairly broadly in the marketplace. And we think these secular growth trends that we're playing into are going to go on for some time. And so the way we're responding to that is we're investing. We're investing in capacity and capability and doing things in our supply chain to ensure that we're in a position to deal with these higher levels of economic activity, higher growth and support what we think is going to be higher growth for these businesses for some time to come. Operator : Next, we'll go to Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Joe Ritchie : Yes. So really, I guess, maybe 2 clarification questions, follow-ups from what others have already asked. The first one, just going back to M&A portfolio. You guys have done a lot, Craig. I'm just curious, what kind of leverage target would you be willing to go to in this environment? Clearly, like your backlog is in really good shape. But I know there's a lot of concern around the uncertainty for 2023 and concern around higher leverage levels across the broader multis. And so I'm just curious for the right deal, what would be your expectation on leverage? Craig Arnold : I mean, and as you know, Joe, you've been around the company for some years. We have, in the past, levered up for the right strategic deal. And as an organization, as a company, we tend to have very good cash generation. And so for us, I would say that for the right deal, we'd be perfectly willing to lever up and go to the same levels that we've been at historically. I will tell you that those deals are not right in front of us today. And so I just -- I don't want to be -- I don't want to set an expectation around some near-term transaction that's going to require that we lever up, which are likely to see from us are deals that are very much consistent with what we've done recently in terms of kind of bite-sized transactions that we can fund largely out of cash without the need to lever up and do larger transactions. But that's just a reality of the marketplace and the type of deals that we'll likely do. But at the same time, if we could find a bigger, more strategic one, we certainly would be willing to lever up in order to do it. Tom Okray : Yes. And just to amplify that a little bit. I mean for the baseline everybody, we're at 2.1x net leverage. So we've got a very strong credit rating. So we've got a large capacity to go up, to Craig's point. And especially with the supply chain constraints starting to mitigate, our cash generation will get even better going forward. So we see a lot of flexibility. Joe Ritchie : Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe just my follow-on question. I know Julian was trying to get at this as well. So maybe I'll focus my comments on the Electrical Americas business. It's hard to like get our head around like your backlog doubling year-over-year at a time when you're growing, call it, mid-teens this year in this business. It seems to suggest that for 2023, you kind of set yourself up for another year of double-digit organic growth. And so just maybe just help us kind of contextualize that or frame it just for the -- just for your Electrical Americas business. Craig Arnold : Yes. I mean I think your math is not wrong, necessarily, right? That certainly given the strong negotiations, one, as you heard Tom talk about, even our negotiations -- largely before we get an order, negotiations continue to be very strong into these secular trends that we\u2019re dealing with. Orders are strong, the backlog is strong. And so we would expect that to translate to revenue growth next year, even in the event of a slowdown.  We're not in a position to give you a number for next year. We'll do that as we mentioned in February. But your math is not terribly wrong. It says we should expect good growth in the Americas next year even with a little bit of a market slowdown. And that's kind of what we tried to do by providing some indications of the various end markets that we're in and how those end markets are likely to perform in 2023. Tom Okray : I think the end market forecast, coupled with the secular trends chart at the beginning of the presentation, these secular trends are real. And we are seeing order flow and backlog consistent with that. And I think we're primed for a good run here. Craig Arnold : The big challenge really to date has been we just don't have the capacity. Our suppliers don't have the capacity to deal with this growth that we're seeing. I mean, obviously, our growth in the quarter in Q4 would be much higher if we had more capacity in place to deal with this demand. And that's what we're addressing right now, not only in our own facilities but also in the supply chain to make sure we are in a position to convert on these great growth opportunities. Operator : Next, we'll go to John Walsh with Credit Suisse. John Walsh : So I apologize. I'm going to try to come at this volume question again just because I think it's really important. Are you seeing accelerating -- or have you seen accelerating volume year-over-year growth as we've gone through 2022? Craig Arnold : Yes. In on word, yes. -- Each quarter, John John Walsh : Yes. Thats great. That\u2019s what I wanted to hear. And I just wanted to confirm that. And then you talked about top line and incrementals. We've had a couple of companies remind us about pension sensitivity, asset returns, tax already this season. I know it's early but just anything to call out below the line as we think about next year? Craig Arnold : Yes. I mean that's a great question, John. I mean there's a lot of moving parts. Let's take pension first. We've got asset returns, discount rate, shape of the yield curve, just to name a few. And we're going through our plan for next year. I wouldn't be surprised if we had a headwind associated with that. We're trying to assess how big that headwind is right now. As it relates to interest expense, it's the same type of dynamic. You've got swap interest income. You've got FX income. You've got CP balances and increasing short-term rates. We've managed that very effectively this year and on a year-to-date basis will look good. As we indicated in our prepared remarks, we'll see more of a headwind in Q4. And we're working through what's going to happen in 2023. I guess what I would stay focused on is we had all those headwinds this year. And we were able to deliver what we said we were going to do. And we'll be focused on doing that next year as well. Craig Arnold : And offsetting some of these headwinds that will be real and Tom articulated that this year we have just an enormous number of operational inefficiencies that we've had to offset as well. And we do expect, as I mentioned in my commentary, that many of these operational inefficiencies, many of which are driven by supply chain constraints, we expect those to get better next year. And so we think we're going to have an offset to a number of these -- because our facilities will run more effectively and more efficiently in 2023 than they have in 2022. Operator : And next, we'll go to Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Deane Dray : One of the inefficiencies in the supply chain that's been nagging everyone has been a semiconductor and electric electronic component situation. You guys thought it might get worse in the second half. So how has it been playing out? Craig Arnold : No. What I'd say is -- and I think what we said as a part of our Q2 earnings call that we didn't expect it to get better. In fact, we didn't expect it to get better until sometime probably in the second half of 2023. And I'd say it largely played out that way that we've seen -- we saw some improvements in metal-based commodities, copper, steel, aluminum. We saw improvements, obviously, in resins. Logistics got better. But semiconductors and almost anything electronic related continues to be a challenge. And that's a challenge we dealt with in Q3 and a challenge that we think we're going to end up dealing with probably for another -- almost 12 months or so before we probably see any material improvement there. So semiconductors continue to be a challenge. We're working through it, but we are seeing improvements in other commodities. Deane Dray : That's good to hear. And then just a follow-up, and we've touched on this before a bit in the answers to Joe's question. And Craig, you've been around the company a long time. So you'll appreciate the spirit of this question is in prior cycles, you would see that the company was so much more exposed to non-res and the non-res cycle. And we'd be asking you about starts and permits and value in place and so forth. But the portfolio today and the end markets, whether it's in secular drivers, data center electrification, all of this has served to minimize the non-res cycle. Just I want to make sure that's correct and should help elongate this cycle in terms of the demand. given your backlog and so forth. So part of this is the question of how you're positioned better in a downturn and less dependent on non-res. And just any color around that would be helpful. Craig Arnold : What I'd say, maybe just to clarify a couple of points, Deane. First of all, we agree with your conclusion, by the way. And the conclusion is the portfolio moves that we've made have positioned the company to be less cyclical to be more long cycle, no cycle. And that is absolutely true. And therefore, we're absolutely convinced that the company will perform very differently in the future in the event of an economic downturn. And as I mentioned in my commentary, we think there'll be a mild one next year. And yet our company and our markets, 85% of them will continue to see strong growth. But just the term nonres means everything other than residential. And so today, for us, as we said, 7% of the company is residential. So nonres or 10% of electrical is residential. So 90% of everything that we do in data centers, in utility, in industrial markets, the term nonres really covers a lot of these other end markets that are certainly doing extremely well right now. So we've tried to get more exposure to the secular growth trends tied to really growing end markets, and that's what we've really done in terms of the portfolio moves that we've done. But your conclusion is absolutely correct that the company will be much less cyclical on a go-forward basis. And we would expect the company to grow even in the face of a recession. Tom Okray : Yes. And just again, I mean, we've talked about this, but just to put a couple of more numbers on this, just to amplify what Craig was saying. I mean utilities orders on a year-over-year basis growing about 50%. On a trailing 12-month basis, about 40%. Data centers year-over-year about 25% and on trailing 12 months, about 35%. So these are big nonres numbers, to use your words, Deane. Operator : Next, we have the line of Chris Snyder with UBS. Chris Snyder : I wanted to follow up on some of the prior commentary around 2023 incrementals in that 30% range. And I know that matches kind of the targeted or more normalized levels to get to the 2025 targets. But I guess the question was it feels like the price cost is still in the company's favor. You guys mentioned earlier that productivity efficiency would return next year. So that has a margin tailwind as well. Are there any kind of offsets there that kind of push the incremental back, just down to that 30% or so? Craig Arnold : I appreciate the question. And I'd say that the other side of that equation is the investments that we're making inside of the businesses. And as we talk about some of these big growth trends that we're facing into and quite frankly, we have a need to invest. And so we -- and we would intend to do that to prioritize growth and putting more feet on the street and investing in technology and the likes to ensure that we're in a great position to take advantage of this growth that we see there. So we still think 30%, we think, from a planning standpoint, we'll give you more details around perhaps a better number when we get to February next year. But we still think at this juncture, you have these countervailing forces. Tom mentioned a number of them as well around whether it's entrant or pension or the like. And so we still think all in 30% incremental is still the right way to position kind of your models for now. And we'll update that as we know more next year. Chris Snyder : Really appreciate all that color. And then just a quick follow-up on the -- on the reshoring announcements and the $1.3 trillion of planned investments that you guys highlighted matches a lot of the data that we've aggregated as well. Can you talk about how much of this is already coming through? Clearly, manufacturing construction has been very, very strong. And then also, what kind of visibility does this provide? These are very large generally kind of slow-moving projects. Craig Arnold : Yes. No, I think to your point, and you hit on kind of we think is an important one where no, we've not really seen today these $1.3 trillion of announcements. We've not seen today the impact of most of this or hardly any of this in our order book at this point. In some cases, it could be in the negotiation pipeline, which Tom indicated is up dramatically. But it's not reflected today in our order book and certainly not reflected in our sales. And so just another one of these things that gives us a lot of confidence around the future growth rate of our electrical business. Operator : Next, we'll go to Joe O'Dea with Wells Fargo. Joe O\u2019Dea: I wanted to circle back to the negotiation pipeline in the U.S. and talking about that kind of more than doubling and just a little bit more detail on kind of what you used to kind of determine on what qualifies as a major project. And then typically, what you see from the time line that goes from negotiation to order and then the time line from sort of order to revenue generation. Craig Arnold : Yes. I'd say the negotiation pipeline today, I'd say it's -- to your point, it's generally a large project. There's a lot of stuff that's going on today that's out in the distribution channel that we don't necessarily have great visibility to. But we do track large projects where we tend to be involved in specifying the application. And so these projects, we have historically tracked them and have great visibility to them. And as we mentioned, those numbers are going up dramatically. And I'd say from -- in the cycle between a negotiation and order, I mean it can vary. I mean it can be on the short end, 90 days. It can be 6 months. It varies depending upon the project. And from an order to a sale, it can -- once again, it can be as short as 90 days. It can be 18 months. It varies quite widely depending upon the project that you're actually supporting. Joe O\u2019Dea: Got it. And then on the distribution side of things. Could you just talk about the mix of product and distribution that might be more kind of commoditized or off the shelf versus the mix that's more spec-ed in? And then anything that you could be seeing in terms of differing sort of inventory management trends, whether some of that\u2019s more off the shelf, if you're seeing inventories come down there at all as opposed to what would be more spec-ed. Craig Arnold : Yes, I'd say, to answer maybe the second part of your question, today, we don't really have almost any part of the business today where our distributors are saying we have more inventory than we need or want. And I think that's a reflection of the broad-based strength that we talked about in our end markets. So some markets are growing faster than others. All of the markets are growing. And for the most part, we have distributor challenges around supporting their demand almost across the board today. To your point around commoditization, we don't really think -- we don't really sell anything that I would call a true commodity. If you think about in the electrical space specifically or even in our industrial businesses, most of what we do is highly specified. And you go from an application engineering to designing a particular solution to getting an order. You don't tend to find that. You can trade stuff once you win a job or you win a project. You tend to deliver that project because it really is engineered into the solution. If you think about what we're doing in the electrical business, essentially, we're protecting assets and people. And if our stuff doesn't work, I mean really bad things happen. And so what we really think that we sell, we sell a highly engineered solution and not much of which is what I'd call commodity. And on the commodity side, you may have some wiring devices or the like that could be sold through our distributors or in some case, could be sold through one of the big box retailers. But for the most part, most of what we do in our businesses are highly engineered and highly specified. Operator : And we'll go to David Raso with Evercore ISI. David Raso : In your mild recession scenario for next year, in Europe, do you see in that scenario where Europe remains in positive growth throughout the year? Obviously, the secular trends, I think, in North America for a variety of reasons, there's obviously more credibility and the ability to outgrow the market that much, outgrow a recession scenario. But do you see the same dynamic in Europe? And again, does it stay positive in your base case throughout the year? Craig Arnold : Yes. I mean it's a great question, Dave, and it's one that we obviously haven't fully modeled out. Clearly, the range of possibilities around what happens in Europe is much wider than perhaps any other region of the world given what's happening today in the Ukraine, given the uncertainty around energy and energy resilience. And so there's a wide range of possibilities in Europe that you could certainly imagine a scenario where the orders that we're currently seeing, orders continue to be hold up well. We are also building backlog and have built backlog in Europe, but that could change quickly depending upon whether or not you have gas flowing into Germany. And so I think the range of possibilities in Europe are quite wide, which is one of the reasons why I said that while we're anticipating really good growth across the board -- but we're going to be ready. And we will take a regional view. And if we need to flex in Europe because they end up dealing with a more severe downturn than we're anticipating right now and more severe than the rest of the world, we have a plan ready to deal with a scenario where markets fall perhaps more than we anticipated. David Raso : Would you -- I'm sorry, go ahead. Tom Okray : Yes, I was just going to add. I think it's important to note that in the quarter, we did see order growth in Europe. And in some of the end markets, fairly strong, for example, in commercial and institution. So we do see some slowing, but we're still seeing growth there. David Raso : Well, you answered 1 of my 2 follow-ups there in a sense of you're saying, orders are so positive in Electrical Global in Europe in the quarter. Any -- if you share with us any sense of how large the backlog is in Europe Electrical on a year-over-year basis? Craig Arnold : I mean I don't have that number -- I believe our backlog on a rolling 12-month basis in Europe is up 27%. I think the numbers I have. So the backlog is still -- Tom Okray : 27% is what I have as well. Craig Arnold : Okay. So 27%, the backlog in Europe? Tom Okray : Yes. Global is up 22% overall, yes. David Raso : Okay. So it's actually more than the global number. Europe is even higher. Craig Arnold : Yes, exactly. David Raso : I think we're just trying to figure out how much coverage do you have if you can avoid cancellations into '23 in Europe, in particular, to Electrical Americas and aerospace kind of drive the Global -- Craig Arnold : And as you can imagine for us, I mean, Europe, as a percentage of our revenue, I mean they're relatively smaller. So Europe today would account for, what, roughly 9%, 10% of the company sales. And so if you think about -- yes, we can certainly absorb a bit of a slowdown in Europe and not really have an outsized impact on the overall company's performance given its relative share within the organization in our mix. Operator : And next, we go to Brett Linzey with Mizuho Americas. Brett Linzey : A lot of ground covered. I appreciate the additional thoughts on '23 markets. I guess if I work through the weighting of those arrows, I get something kind of mid-single-digit, 5% to 6% range for market growth. But then I imagine you have some carryover price and perhaps some outgrow. So just curious how you would maybe dimension those other pieces. Craig Arnold : I think I'd say it's early for us to kind of give you the insight. We'll do that in February. But clearly, there's going to be carryover price. I mean you want to know that price is generally in the market data as well, by the way. And so when you think about a market index, there is some price built into that as well. You can debate how much is built in. Is it more or less than what you're assuming? But there is price built into that data. But it's just early at this point for us to give you any particular company-related growth numbers. I mean markets are going to be good. We would expect generally to do better than markets. And so that would be a fair assumption. But it's just early to give you any more detail than that at this point. Brett Linzey : Yes. No, understood. And just 1 more on the backlog. Obviously, very robust, but just curious if you could share some color on the margin profile of the orders being booked, looks like relative to what's being shipped, I would expect there would be some favorability in material prices to come off highs. But anything you can share in terms of mix or price costs there? Craig Arnold : I'd say that -- and as you know, we've talked about on prior calls, I'd say that we took some pretty unconventional steps early on and in many cases, we're not -- reprice the backlog. So I would say today that -- our backlog today and the pricing and the margin on the backlog is not terribly different than kind of the way the business is performing today, the underlying profitability of the business today. Certainly, there's a question around the future direction of commodity prices and whether or not we see more or less inflation and deflation that can change it. But the profitability in the backlog, I would argue is it's not terribly different today than what we're seeing in our business. Operator : And we'll go to Phil Buller with Berenberg. Phil Buller : Just one from me, please. I appreciate you don't break out price. But do you feel as though you're at or approaching a ceiling anywhere on price. You've clearly explained and are convicted about the demand side outstripping supply in most areas, which we can see pretty clearly in the order figures. But are there any areas where you're now seeing price elasticity kicking back in? Or have you managed to increase the price intra quarter in a pretty uniform manner across the different businesses? Craig Arnold : No, I appreciate the question. The first thing I'll tell you is that if you think about our industries and over a long period of time, pricing tends to be sticky in this industry. Prices -- once you get a price increase, they typically -- you hold it. I think one of the big advantages we have is because it goes through distribution, price is obviously good for distributors. But more broadly than it, I'd say that we really, today, are not seeing our overall costs come down either because -- on the one hand, some of the major commodities that we buy have come off to some of the peak levels. But what we're really seeing today in the business is we're seeing -- because of supply and demand, not just our supply and demand, but with our suppliers, we're seeing labor-related inflation. And so we're not today really in an environment where we're seeing deflation necessarily in our costs either on an all-in basis. But I think the bigger message is price does tend to be sticky. The idea of a ceiling -- I think a ceiling is really a reflection of what happens to your input costs. And at this point, we do think that the worst is behind us in terms of inflation in aggregate. We think labor will continue to see inflation and perhaps at an accelerated pace. That will probably offset some of the deflation that we're seeing on some of the major commodity inputs that we have. But in aggregate, we don't anticipate to go into a deflationary cycle. Operator : And with that, no further questions in queue. I'll turn it back to the company. Yan Jin : Thanks, guys. We have reached the end of the call, and we do appreciate everybody's questions. As always, Chip and myself will be available for -- answer any follow-up questions. Thank you for joining us. Have a great day. Craig Arnold : Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Yan Jin, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Yan Jin : Good morning, everyone. Thank you all for joining us for Eaton's Fourth Quarter 2022 Earning Call. With me today are Craig Arnold, our Chairman and CEO; and Tom Okray, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our agenda today includes opening remarks by Craig, then we will turn it over to Tom, who will highlight the company's performance in the fourth quarter. As we have done on our past calls, we will be taking questions at the end of Craig's closing commentary. The press release and the presentation we'll go through today have been posted on our website. This presentation includes adjusted earnings per share, adjusted free cash flow and other non-GAAP measures. They're reconciled in the appendix. A webcast of this call is accessible on our website and will be available for replay. I would like to remind you that our comments today will include statements related to the expected future results of the company and are therefore forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our forecasted projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earning release and the presentation. With that, I will turn it over to Craig. Craig Arnold : Thanks, Yan. We'll begin with the highlights of the quarter on Page 3. And I'll start by noting that we again delivered very strong results in the quarter and record performance for the year. We generated adjusted EPS of $2.06 for the quarter and $7.57 for the year, both all-time records in each period. Our Q4 adjusted EPS was up 20% from prior year. Our sales were $5.4 billion, up 15% organically and for the second quarter in a row with particular strength in utility, industrial, commercial institution, data center markets for electrical and commercial aerospace, vehicle and eMobility markets on the industrial side. And we continue to post strong margins. Q4 margins of 20.8% were up 150 basis points from prior year, near the high end of our guidance range. And incremental margins were 33% in the quarter. For the full year, we delivered record segment margins of 20.2%, up 130 basis points from prior year. And as noted here, orders continue to remain very strong. On a rolling 12-month basis, Electrical orders were up 25% and Aerospace orders increased 24%, which led, quite frankly, to record backlogs as well, up 68% in Electrical and up 21% in Aerospace. Now lastly, in what was an otherwise challenging year, we generated record free cash flow in the quarter with adjusted free cash flow up 41%. And our free cash flow as a percentage of sales was 18.1% in the quarter. While improved cash flow in the second half of the year, it wasn't enough to really achieve the full year cash flow targets. As we indicated, we continue to prioritize supporting higher organic growth, winning new orders and protecting our customers, which all contributed to higher levels of working capital. But we still have work to do and with a focus on those areas that don't impact revenue growth. On Page 4, I summarize our performance highlights for last year. Overall, I'd say, in a challenging operating environment, our team delivered strong financial results. And as noted here, we exceeded three of our four key financial metrics. First, for organic revenue, we posted 13% growth, which was actually more than 60% above our original guidance at the midpoint. Throughout '22, we raised our organic revenue growth in all segments, and the team delivered on the organic growth expectations that we set. It's worth noting that our largest business, Electrical Americas, delivered 16% organic growth, 2x the midpoint of our original guidance. Second, I'd note that we continue to demonstrate our ability to drive profitable growth with record margins of 20.2% in 2022, which was 10 basis points above our original guidance at the midpoint. Third, adjusted EPS of $7.57 was $0.07 higher than the midpoint of our original guidance. And I'd note that we fully offset the impact of some $500 million of unfavorable currency or roughly $0.20 a share. Lastly, I'd note that we did miss our free cash flow guidance for the year. Most of this miss went into working capital to support higher levels of sales and orders and the record backlogs. But I'd say here, once again, I know we can do better. As you might expect, supply chain disruptions and our decision to prioritize protecting customers with higher inventory played a major role in this inventory growth over the year. But overall, I'd say it was a good year despite a year filled with inflation, labor shortages, supply chain disruptions and FX headwinds, and the team delivered record financial results and we go into 2023 with positive momentum. So turning to Page 5. I hope at this point, you would agree that 2022 wasn't an exceptional year but just another year of delivering what we promised. And that it reflects the fundamental changes that we've made to the company over the last decade. We are a very different company today than we were 10 years ago. We've embraced the realities of a changing world and a necessity for us to change as well. We're now in attractive growth-oriented end markets, and we have a proven formula for how we run the company better through the Eaton Business System. With this transformation, we've become a stronger company that has delivered higher growth, higher margins and better earnings consistency. And we continue to be a good steward of your capital. The end result is the new Eaton where some 90% of our profits now come from Electrical and Aerospace businesses. But once again, when I'm done, we'll continue to apply our operational model, our strategic framework and our potential criteria, and we'd expect to continue to maximize value to all of our stakeholders. And as you can see on Page 6, what this transformation has delivered to our shareholders. As you would expect, our strong results have translated into very strong financial results. And for the sake of comparison, we charted total shareholder returns for 3, 5 and 7 years. And we've compared our results with the S&P 500, the medium of our peer group and the XLI Industrial Index. And in every case, Eaton has significantly outperformed our benchmarks. And as I'll explain in the next few slides, we do believe our best days are still in front of us. Turning to Page 7. Our transformation into a global intelligent power management company has positioned Eaton at the center of some of -- what we think are some of the most important trends that we'll see in our lifetime. The most significant being climate change and all the downstream implications that it brings. As we all know, climate change is driving the need to transition from fossil fuels to renewables, and increased regulations are driving the demand for new solutions. These solutions will require tremendous investments in renewables and grid infrastructure for both new and existing buildings. This trend is also closely coupled to need to electrify the economy. Cars, trucks, planes, buildings are all requiring more electrical content. And as we move away from fossil fuels, this allows us to take advantage of renewables. And digitalization is providing us access to data and insights that are allowing us to be more connected, more productive and more efficient than ever. It's also, by the way, creating a need for more data centers, an important end market for Eaton. Additive to these trends, we're also on the front end of an aerospace recovery cycle that will drive growth in both our commercial and military markets. I don't know about you, but I can tell you, I don't -- I can't think of a company with a better set of market dynamics than Eaton. And while we're not ready to change our long-term growth goals, I'd be surprised if we didn't exceed our previously announced targets of 5% to 8% annual growth. Next, on Page 8, we highlight how these megatrends are supported by unprecedented government stimulus spending really around the world. In fact, these programs will have a direct impact on the growth rate of more than half of our end markets. And in the U.S. alone, the Infrastructure Act from 2021 and the Inflation Reduction Act from 2022 will fund some $450 billion of grid modernization and other climate-related programs. And of particular importance to Eaton is the $88 billion that are set aside for power grid updates and EV charging networks and incentives. In Europe, the EU recovery plan recovers -- provides, excuse me, $244 billion of green energy transition, which member states are now working on implementing. And in China, the government has set clear goals to lower carbon emissions. They've laid out plans to strengthen their grid by 2025, including investments in more wind and solar. China also continues to lead the world in the adoption of electric vehicles. But even if you exclude China, we still estimate that between the U.S. and EU programs will expand Eaton's addressable market by some $11 billion to $14 billion over the next 5 years. And I'd say this is just another powerful tailwind that supports our confidence in the growth outlook of the company. Tom will pick it up here and take you through the numbers. Tom Okray : Thanks, Craig. On Page 9, I'll begin with highlighting a few key points regarding our Q4 results. Revenue was up 12% with organic growth of 15%, partially offset by a 4% foreign exchange headwind and a 1% favorable net impact from acquisitions. This outcome illustrates our focus of prioritizing growth in our customers. With total revenue growth of 12%, we posted solid operating leverage. Operating profit grew 21% and adjusted EPS grew 20%. Further, excluding the $0.05 impact from foreign exchange, growth in adjusted EPS would have been 23%. All in, strong organic growth and margins enabled us to report all-time record adjusted earnings of $825 million and adjusted EPS of $2.06, which was above our guidance midpoint. Lastly, I'd like to note that we continue to raise the bar with our Q4 records for both segment operating margin and segment operating profit. Moving on to the next chart, we summarized strong financial performance for our Electrical Americas business. For yet another quarter, we have set all-time records for sales, operating profit and margin. Further, we've also set all-time records for these metrics for the full year. Organic sales growth accelerated from 18% in Q3 to 20% in Q4 with robust growth in every end market and particular strength in utility, data center and commercial and institutional markets. Operating margin of 23.7% was up 450 basis points versus prior year, benefiting from higher volumes. In addition, incremental margins were quite strong at 47%. We continue to manage price effectively to more than offset inflationary pressures. Further, it should be noted that Electrical Americas outperformed their original 2020 guidance by 100 basis points. Orders in backlog continued to be very strong. On a rolling 12-month basis, orders were up 34%, which remains at a high level with strong growth across the board and particular strength in data center, utility and industrial markets. Backlog ended the year up 87% versus prior year and increased sequentially from Q3. In addition to the robust trends and orders in backlog, our major project negotiations pipeline in Q4 was up nearly 100% versus prior year from especially strong growth in manufacturing, data center, industrial and utility end markets. Overall, Electrical Americas had a strong quarter to round out a very good year and continues to be well positioned as we start 2023. Moving to Page 11, we show results for our Electrical Global segment, which produced another strong quarter, including records for Q4 and full year records for sales, operating profit and margins. Organic growth was up 8%, which was entirely offset by headwinds from foreign exchange of 7% and divestiture of 1%. With respect to organic growth, we saw strength in utility, industrial and data center end markets. On a regional basis, we posted high single-digit organic growth in IEMEA and mid-single-digit organic growth in APAC. Operating margin of 18.7% was down 80 basis points versus prior year, primarily due to foreign exchange headwinds. We continue to see good order intake. Orders were up 11% on a rolling 12-month basis with strength in data center and commercial and institutional markets. Backlog growth of 17% also remains strong. Before moving to our industrial businesses, I'd like to briefly recap the combined Electrical segments. For Q4, we posted organic growth of 15%, incremental margins of 44% and operating margin of 21.8%, which was 250 basis points of year-over-year margin improvement. For the full year, our Electrical segments grew 15% organically, generated 33% incremental margin, increased margin 140 basis points, posted 25% rolling 12 months order growth and increased backlog 68%. We are confident that we're well positioned for continued growth with strong margins in our overall Electrical business. The next chart recaps our Aerospace segment. We posted all-time record sales and operating profit for both the quarter and on a full year basis. Organic growth accelerated to 11% with a 4% headwind from foreign exchange. This growth was driven by strength in commercial markets with commercial aftermarket up 35% and commercial OEM up more than 20%. Relative to profit, operating margin was strong at 24.5%. And it's worth noting that Aerospace outperformed their original 2020 guidance by 100 basis points. Order growth and backlog are very encouraging. On a rolling 12-month basis, order acceleration continued, up 24% compared to 22% in Q3 and 19% in Q2 with strength across all end markets. Similar to Q3, we saw especially strong growth in military OEM orders, up 80% in the quarter, which positions us well for growth in 2023 and confirms our expectations for increased defense spending, including breakout performance in 2024. Year-over-year backlog increased from 17% in Q3 to up 21% in Q4. Moving on to our Vehicle segment on Page 13. Vehicle had strong revenue growth in the second half of the year. In Q4, revenue was up 16% with 18% organic growth and 2% unfavorable foreign exchange. This coming off 19% organic growth in Q3. We saw growth across all markets with particular strength in North America and South America light vehicle. We also saw double-digit growth in APAC. Operating margins came in at 15.2% with unfavorability to prior year, primarily due to manufacturing inefficiencies. As expected, we were able to completely offset the impact of inflation with pricing in Q4. We also secured wins in new and sustainable technologies, such as EV gearing and transmissions, with a large and growing opportunity pipeline. On Page 14, we show results for our eMobility business. We generated very strong growth in the quarter. Revenue was up 58%, including 17% from organic growth and 44% from the acquisition of Royal Power, partially offset by 3% negative foreign exchange. Margin improved 780 basis points versus prior year driven by higher volumes and the impact from Royal Power. We remain encouraged by the growth prospects of the eMobility segment. Since 2018, we've won $1.4 billion of mature year revenues in this business, including a recent $400 million win for power protection and distribution units with a European customer. This is a major new program win in both U.S. and European markets with production starting in 2024. This win demonstrates Eaton's ability to leverage our capabilities across our entire portfolio, including core technology in both electrical and industrial businesses. We partnered with our customer to electrify their mobile platform with solutions, including Breaktor and Bussmann fuses. We also leverage our extensive vehicle expertise and added content from our Royal Power acquisition. Overall, we continue to make progress toward our long-term goal to create a $2 billion to $4 billion business with 15% margins by 2030. We are now on track to exceed our expectation to deliver $1.2 billion of revenue and 11% margin by 2025. Moving to Page 15. I'm going to unpack a theme that Craig mentioned at the top of the call related to our strategic investments in working capital to support strong orders and backlog, which enables accelerated organic growth. Overall, in spite of supporting surging orders and backlog, we are driving working capital improvements. To illustrate the trend, I'll provide a couple of examples. Net working capital to orders and inventory as a percentage of backlog. Focusing on the left side of the chart, the average value of our Electrical and Aerospace quarterly orders in 2022 was more than 20% higher than 2021 and 33% more than 2019. However, to support these increasing orders, we have only slightly increased the absolute value of our working capital. The result is shown in the graph on the left side of the page. Our ratio of net working capital at year-end to trailing 12-month orders has stepped down significantly from 2019 to 2022. Moving to the right side of the chart. Another way to look at working capital efficiency is comparing backlog growth to inventory growth. At the end of 2022, our Electrical and Aerospace backlog reached approximately $11 billion, which is up almost 160% since the end of 2019. However, to support this much larger backlog, inventory for our Electrical and Aerospace businesses has only increased by 38% since 2019. The graph on the right side of the slide highlights the significant improvement since 2019. Our inventory as a percentage of backlog has been roughly cut in half from the end of 2019 to the end of 2022. We are supporting a much larger backlog with a smaller percentage of inventory. In summary, we have prudently prioritized taking care of our customers and capturing growth, which has required investments in working capital and has impacted free cash flow metrics in the short term. That said, we are managing working capital more efficiently. The 2023 guidance on Page 16 shows that we are well positioned for another strong year of financial performance. Our organic growth guidance for 2023 is a range of 7% to 9% with particular strength in Electrical Americas and Aerospace with organic growth rates of 8% to 10%. eMobility is also a standout with 35% organic growth guidance at the midpoint tied to the ramp of new programs. These organic growth rates correspond to our end-market growth assumptions that we provided on our Q3 earnings call and that Craig will update in a few slides. The end-market growth, combined with increased backlog, provides tremendous visibility and confidence in our 2023 outlook. For segment margins, our guidance range of 20.7% and 21.1% is a 70-basis points improvement at the midpoint from our 2022 all-time record margin of 20.2%. In addition to projecting strong organic growth for 2023, we're also growing margins and continue to invest in future organic growth. Moving to Page 17. We have the balance of our guidance for 2023 and Q1. I'll touch on some highlights. For 2023, we are guiding adjusted EPS in the range of $8.04 to $8.44, which has a midpoint of $8.24 is 9% growth over 2022. We expect continued foreign exchange headwinds, which we estimate between $100 million and $200 million adverse. For operating cash flow, our guidance of $3.2 billion to $3.6 billion is a 34% increase at the midpoint over 2022. The key drivers here are a combination of higher earnings and improved working capital, particularly lower inventory levels as supply chains normalize. While our plan includes significant improvement in free cash flow during 2023, I'll note that we anticipate due to higher interest expense and CapEx in Q1 as well as timing-related headwinds such as taxes that free cash flow in Q1 will be relatively flat year-over-year. For share repurchases, we anticipate a range of $300 million to $600 million. Moving to Q1. For Q1, we are guiding organic growth of 8% to 10%, segment margins between 19.5% and 19.9%, and adjusted EPS in a range of $1.72 to $1.82. Now I'll hand it back to Craig to walk us through the market outlook and wrap up the presentation. Craig Arnold : Thanks, Tom. Turning to Page 18, we provide a look at our current market assumptions for the year. This chart has been updated from what we shared in our Q3 earnings call, but we really don't see any material changes here. I'll remind you that we do expect a mild recession in 2023. But given the secular growth trends that we've talked about, our strong orders and healthy backlog, we would expect to see growth in most of our end markets with six of our end markets representing some 70% of the company up nicely. And these markets are also, by the way, supported by a very strong negotiation pipeline. Of note, we now expect even stronger growth within our commercial and institutional segment given the relatively strong orders growth in the quarter and the continued strength in Dodge nonresidential construction contracts. The only down market is expected to be residential, which only accounts for 8% of our revenue. In total, we're encouraged to report that 85% of our markets are expected to see positive growth in 2023. And lastly, let me close on Page 19 just with a few summary comments. First, I'd say our thesis for Eaton as a changed company has continued to pay even better than we expected. Second, the growth trends, the right investments have delivered better top line growth, and we continue to run the company better. We delivered 13% organic growth with record orders and backlog. And despite supply chain challenges, an inflationary environment and significant FX headwinds, 2022 was a year of record profits, record margins, record adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS. And I'm particularly encouraged by our 20% increase in adjusted EPS growth in Q4, which I see as a positive indicator for 2023. So despite the macro concerns, we expect 2023 to be another very strong year. And the company is on track and likely ahead of schedule for delivering our 2025 goals for revenue, margins, free cash flow and adjusted EPS. So I'll stop here and open things up for any questions that you may have. Yan Jin : Thanks, Craig. [Operator Instructions]. Thanks in advance for your cooperation. With that, I will turn it over to the operator to give you guys the guidance. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And our first question is from the line of Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research. Nigel Coe : So still very strong trends in -- especially in Electrical Americas. I'm just curious, we are seeing a divergence, especially on backlog between Americas and Global. Is that primarily macro in your opinion? Or do you think there's more secular tailwinds hitting in the Americas with all the similar money coming through? And any details on the front log of projects in the Americas would be very helpful. Craig Arnold : Yes. No, we're very pleased, obviously, with the growth that we're seeing in both our global business as well as in the Americas business, but the Americas business is clearly performing extremely well. And I think -- if you think about some of the things that we talked about, Nigel, whether it's this stimulus spending where the U.S. is really pumping fairly significant dollars into markets that are really important for us, you think about some of these large projects and let's call it, reshoring that's taking place in the U.S. market, that's certainly strengthening the U.S. business as well. So I do think there's a lot of macros today that are strong for the company across the board that are just, I'd say, intensified when you think about what's going on in the U.S. market right now. So the secular trends are everywhere. We talk about energy transition, electrification. It's taking place across the world. And I just think the U.S., because of this increased focus on infrastructure reindustrialization, is seeing an additional boost above some of the other regions of the world. Nigel Coe : Okay. I'm not sure if there's any particular projects you'd call out or when you call out on the front log. But my follow-up question is probably for Tom. The $70 million of corporate expenses in 2023. Maybe you could just break that out between true corporate's interest and pension. Tom Okray : Yes. Thanks, Nigel. Most of that is going to be in interest expense and pension with interest expense even being greater than pension. And I would caution that there's a lot of moving parts on both of those, what's going to happen to interest rate, what's going to happen to the shape of the yield curve, discount rates, those types of things. But as we're projecting it now, the headwinds are really related to interest expense and pension with interest expense being the dominant one. Operator : And the next question is from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski from Morgan Stanley. Joshua Pokrzywinski : So Craig, you mentioned kind of planning for a mild recession and guidance. Can you maybe put that in the context of backlog conversion? And maybe specifically, I think data center and commercial construction, you're starting to hear a little bit more in the way of cyclical concerns. Obviously, the orders are so strong. But how would you think of how much backlog ideally you'd be converting, if any, this year in the context of that recession outlook? Craig Arnold : Yes. I appreciate the question, Josh. And we've obviously spent a lot of time internally trying to sort that one through ourselves. And I would tell you that orders have just stayed so strong in general. It's really tough to really put a finger on how much of this very large backlog that we'll be able to convert. It certainly will depend upon what happens during the course of 2023. And I can just tell you what's actually baked into our forecast for the year is relatively modest reductions in backlog, if at all. Because at this point, it looks like these markets, driven by the secular growth trends that we talked about, are going to stay stronger for even longer than what we anticipated. And so at this point, we'll have to wait and see. But if we end up with perhaps a little bit of a respite here in terms of some of the order intake or some of the supply chain challenges, we'll be able to convert more, and that could be upside on the revenue side. But at this point, we're not anticipating that we're going to be burning a lot of backlogs. Joshua Pokrzywinski : Got it. That's helpful. Then just a follow-up. Really appreciate kind of the TAM expansion color that you gave from some of the stimulus. I know not a lot of folks have taken a stab at that. I remember from the Analyst Day correctly, I think you sized the TAM for Eaton before that -- in kind of the high $50s billion. Does this mean that we kind of take this extra $11 billion to $14 billion divided by 5, because it's over 5 years and you have sort of 4% uplift to growth like -- or is this an apples and oranges kind of discussion? Just any context how the TAM increase relates to kind of the growth uptick would be helpful. Craig Arnold : I think your simple logic there is the right logic that based upon this stimulus spending, these are essentially incremental dollars that we would expect to be going into these end markets, which will increase the size of the TAM in our served market. And so I think your kind of high-level assumption is the right working assumption to have. And obviously, there'll be lots of discussions around how it plays out and over what period of time do these investments play out. Is it 3 years, 5 years? I mean, what's the time frame? I think it will be the more difficult call to make, but it absolutely increases the size of the market. Tom Okray : Yes. And just to add a little bit more color on that, I mean going back to the prepared remarks, if you look at our major project U.S. pipeline, many of the end markets quarter-over-quarter are up over 100%. And that's also translating to order volume even higher than that. So we're just seeing some good tailwinds on these major projects. Craig Arnold : Yes. Just to build on Tom's point, as I think everybody's aware, we obviously have sales and orders, but we also look at negotiations and our negotiation pipeline. And as Tom mentioned, the negotiation pipeline being up more than 100%. And I'd say that is supported by the other data point that I talked about, which is essentially nonresidential construction contracts, which are also up quite dramatically through, once again, the fourth quarter. So we continue to see very good strength in these underlying markets, especially in the Americas. Operator : And the next question is from Andrew Obin from Bank of America. Andrew Obin : So the first question, I guess, we've been getting incoming calls on data centers. And just if you can talk as to how much visibility do you have where you are in terms of capacity for '23? Do you have any left? And the new one we're getting was all the focus on ChatGPT, right? Are you getting any inquiries sort of related to AI and more computing sort of required to do that? And if you have any conversations related today at the interest of that topic. Craig Arnold : Yes. We -- as you can imagine, we anticipated this question because we too are reading some of the conflicting headlines in terms of what's going on in the data center market. And then as we talked about, our data center business continues to be very strong. And what you talked about, Josh, in the context of AI and these other various technology platforms that continue to be rolled out. That's just, once again, generating the need for more data, more processing and ultimately more data centers. And I know there's a little bit of a cause for some concern given what some of the hyperscale guys did with respect to their own outlook. But I can tell you that for us, the data center market continues to be very strong. And even the hyperscale guys are still talking about mid-teens kind of growth over the next 3 to 4 years. And so those are very strong numbers. And we haven't talked about autonomous driving and expansion of 5G. And every device that we make today and that is made by every company continues to get more intelligent, driving a greater need for data and processing. And so we think the data center market is going to be a great market for quite a number of years to come, and it's supported by our order intake and our negotiations. To your question specifically on capacity, at this point, we really don't have a lot of spare capacity. We're making investments to expand our capacity. But at this point, we have lots of visibility into the data center market, and it feels good. Tom Okray : Yes. I would also point out... Andrew Obin : And just -- yes, sorry. Tom Okray : Oops, sorry, Andrew. I would also point out that this isn't only an America's phenomenon. We're seeing strong order growth across the entire globe. Andrew Obin : And just a follow-up question. And at both stimulus, I think, related to IRA but also what's happening with LNG in Europe, what's the latest out of Crouse-Hinds? Because I think it is exposed to all these trends. And also have -- does Crouse-Hinds benefit from any decarbonization efforts, hydrogen, carbon sequestration? Just as I said, just maybe talk a little bit about what you're seeing in Crouse-Hinds. Craig Arnold : Yes. Appreciate the question. The first thing I'll just maybe give the team a little bit of a news announcement that we've changed the name. What was formerly known as Crouse-Hinds and B-Line is now we're calling it our global energy infrastructure business, so GEIS. And so just if you hear us talk about GEIS, that's the formerly known Crouse-Hinds and B-Line business. And I'd say absolutely, I mean, as the name implies, anything that has to do with energy infrastructure is a real positive for our GEIS business. And we would expect that, that business continues to perform well as we continue to see investments in energy. And certainly, as we look at hydrogen and other new greener forms of energy, all of the infrastructure that's required to support those investments will be very positive for our GEIS business as well. Tom Okray : Yes. I mean, for example, if you look at trailing 12-month orders in GEIS and utilities, they were close to 30%, very strong. Operator : The next question is from the line of Stephen Volkmann from Jefferies. Stephen Volkmann : Craig, maybe just start off, could you provide a little bit more color on what you're seeing in commercial and institutional that made you sort of bump that market outlook up? Craig Arnold : Yes. And I'd say, once again, the very minimum, we saw very strong order intake in Q4. But also, we talked a little bit what's going on generally in nonres construction. And we look at the commercial negotiate nonres commercial contracts, construction contracts, just really posting pretty significant numbers in the fourth quarter. And so we thought that, that market would be positive. But given the activity level, our negotiations in that segment as well as what's going on more broadly in the industry and some of the macro data, it caused us to be even more positive on that market. And so it's, I'd say, a good news story. We'll wait and see how it plays out in total. But certainly, the data that we saw in the fourth quarter was definitely more positive than what we anticipated. Stephen Volkmann : Okay. Great. And then I know it's early for this question. But Tom, since you brought it up, I think you mentioned something about breakout performance in 2024. Not sure if that was sort of military aero-specific. But just can you expand on that a little bit? Tom Okray : Yes. No, it is a little early, but I walked into it and I mentioned it in the prepared remarks. We're just seeing significant order growth in military OEM. And we've been waiting to see that just given what's happening in the world. And now it's starting to come through in all of our order metrics, whether it's trailing 12 months or Q4 year-over-year or even sequentially, up very, very high numbers. Craig Arnold : In fact, our military OE orders for the last 12 months was up 45%-ish. Tom Okray : Exactly and 80% in the quarter. Craig Arnold : In the quarter. So really strong. Tom Okray : Really strong, yes. Craig Arnold : And given the lead times in that business, it will certainly support the growth assumption that we have baked in for 2023. But we do expect that 2024 will be a really strong year. Tom Okray : And it comes back to the way Craig started out the presentation of what these megatrends. And maybe we'll have pockets of weakness here and there, but the portfolio is so sound that -- we've also got the aero megatrend with pent-up demand. We've got military that's growing. We have pent-up demand with vehicles. So we're really not susceptible to any one small thing that's going to knock us down. It's a very robust portfolio. Operator : The next question is from the line of Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research. Jeffrey Sprague : I was wondering if we could just drill into Global Electrical a little bit more, just the quarter itself and then the outlook. Could you possibly elaborate a little bit more on what happened in the margins in the quarter? And I guess the perspective of my question is, it was a pretty sizable sequential step-down in margins on similar revenues, and it looked like similar FX to me sequentially. Maybe I'm wrong there. But is there something else going on with mix or some other factor in the margins in the quarter? And then I was wondering if you could also just address the top line outlook in Global. The 4% to 6% is somewhat moderating. Just maybe a little color on the underlying demand trends you're seeing there or if anything is going on in the channels. Tom Okray : Yes. Thanks, Jeff. Let me start out with talking about the Americas margins. I mean the story is really when you look at it compared to Electrical... Craig Arnold : Global margins. Global margins. Tom Okray : Yes. No -- oh, yes. We have 20% in the Americas volume growth. We had 8% in Electrical Global. So there's the real disparity going on there. And if you look closer into Global as well, we had some transactional FX issue, not necessarily translational but transactional, where we still have dollar-denominated costs. And with the dollar weakening, that hurt us there. So that was part of also the compare and the hurting of the margins on Electrical Global. Craig Arnold : And on the growth side of the equation, I'd say that we're looking at kind of mid-single-digit growth in our Global business. And I'd say in the face of what we're saying today is likely typical recession, we think mid-single-digit growth is the right kind of place to kind of be thinking about that business. Now once again, if the world turns out to be a little happier than what we're anticipating and on the margin, I would say that I think we're all feeling a little better today about 2023 than we were maybe a month ago. And we have seen even in the European market, on a relative basis, some strengthening. Those numbers could be better. But at this point, given our current assumptions, we think mid-single-digit growth for our Global business is the right place to kind of be thinking about it. And the other one I would say just on the margin that could be slightly better than what we're currently thinking is what's happening today in China. Nobody anticipated COVID running through China as quickly as it did. It had an impact in Q4 for sure. Part of maybe the inefficiency challenges we had in Global was the fact that we had some unanticipated disruptions coming out of Asia, coming out of China, specifically around COVID. But at this juncture, they're through it, and they got through it much quicker than anyone imagined. And we think on the margin, China and Asia could be stronger than what we anticipated. Tom Okray : Right. Yes. Thanks for the assist, Craig. Yes, coming back to the margin question, in addition to transactional FX, Jeff, we also saw weakness in China opening up. So APAC was weaker than we had expected. Jeffrey Sprague : Great. And then just as a follow-up. Can you just -- sorry if you said it, I missed it. But I know you're not going to give us price. But when I look at the margin bridge for next year, what does that kind of assume for the price/cost gap there? I assume there is some lift. Maybe you could give us a little perspective on what you're expecting. Tom Okray : Yes. We're not going to break it out specifically as per our policy. What I will say is that we expect to continue to effectively manage price/cost. It's something we really focus on, and we expect to manage it effectively. Craig Arnold : And the only thing I would add to what Tom is that I would not anticipate it would be accretive to margins, right? So clearly, there's still inflation that we have in the business. We are more than offsetting inflation. But in terms of how it's impacting the margins in the business, I would not expect that it would be accretive to margins. That's really a function of what we're doing to drive improvements in efficiencies as well as the volume lift that we're getting from the company overall. Operator : The next question is from the line of Nicole DeBlase from Deutsche Bank. Nicole DeBlase : Maybe just starting with channel inventory levels, Craig. Have definitely heard some concern about distributors maybe having a little bit of excess inventory or inventory building. What are you guys seeing in your channels within Electrical? Craig Arnold : Yes. I'd say -- in aggregate, Nicole, I would say that we've not seen that nor have we heard that from our big channel partners in aggregate. Today, if you look at -- once again, if you think about our order intake, our growth in backlog and you throw that up against -- Tom did a great job of laying out what it's meant in the context of our own inventory. And while we're building inventory, we're actually increasing our efficiency as it relates to a forward view of revenue. And I think that would be true for many of our distributors as well given the strength in the underlying market, certainly in the Americas. I would say that if you take a look at Europe specifically, while we're still seeing growth in our own orders in Europe, there has been a little bit of a slowdown in Europe. And while still growth, we have seen a little bit of a slowdown and a bit of an inventory adjustment that's taking place with some of our European distributors. And I think -- China, I think, will be going in the other direction as that market comes through COVID and begin to grow again. So very slightly regionally in aggregate. I'd say no inventory destocking to speak of at all. Regionally, a little bit of destocking in Europe with the U.S., and perhaps Asia market is still a little bit tight. Tom Okray : Yes. Just to punch a specific number Nicole, I gave some numbers on the one chart, but our average quarterly orders in 2022 versus 2020 are up 55%, very big number. Nicole DeBlase : Got it. And I guess, looking at the guidance for the first quarter, you got organic decelerating to the 8% to 10% range versus 15% in 4Q. I guess, can you just talk through some of the segment-level drivers there? And is that mostly a function of just tougher comps? Craig Arnold : Yes. The revenue guide for Q1 versus Q4, I'd just say, one, we're anniversarying bigger numbers in Q1 last year. So certainly, it's the anniversary effect of it. We certainly have gotten quite a bit of price during the course of 2022 to offset inflation. So on a relative basis, you don't maybe have as much lift on a quarter-over-quarter basis in price. And I'd say those are really the two. And then there's this whole question around recession and how that's going to impact confidence in the outlook. And so lots of uncertainty. If you think about our growth for the year, Q1 is very much aligned at 9% at the midpoint with our growth for the year. And we'll see how the year unfolds, but those are primarily the reasons. Operator : The next question is from the line of Scott Davis from Melius Research. Scott Davis : Guys, you've been a little quiet on the M&A side since the Royal Power deal, which is fine, but there wasn't really anything in your slides on kind of target buybacks or anything where you're prioritizing capital allocation for '23. Can you comment on that, please? Tom Okray : Yes. Sure, Scott. Yes, nothing really in the prepared remarks because we're staying the course with our same capital allocation tenets. Obviously, first, we're prioritizing organic growth, which we think is so important, especially with all the megatrends and secular tailwinds that we're right in the middle of. We're going to pay a competitive dividend as well. It's important to our investors. Having said that, we continue to be in the market and look for good acquisitions. We're also -- if you noted, we're also shrinking the tail in terms of divestitures. We had a small one that we did in the quarter. So we're actively doing that. And then in terms of buying back shares, this year, we did about $290 million. We guided $300 million to $600 million, and we'll be optimistic -- I mean, opportunistic there as appropriate. But it really hasn't changed. We're in the market. We're always looking. And yes, staying the course on our capital allocation tenets. Craig Arnold : And if I can just emphasize the point that Tom made is that we have just a lot of organic growth opportunities out there more than ever in terms of the history of the company. And so as we think about growing the enterprise, we don't need to go out and do acquisitions to grow the enterprise. There's plenty of organic growth opportunities in front of us that we're investing to support. And -- but we'll continue to be opportunistic. If we see something that helps us strategically, maybe geographically -- one of the things that you've seen us do over the course of the last 12 months is we've really, I'd say, shored up our strategic position in China. We've entered into a number of joint ventures, and that's really the way we're trying to play the China card right now given some of the risks and uncertainties. But we entered into a number of really interesting joint ventures with local companies who have a strong position in the local market. We've taken a minority position. We will basically sell those products in markets outside of China, but they really do fill some really key product gaps in emerging markets in low-cost countries. And so yes, we've done some things on the JV side that I think shore up our position where we've had gaps, but there are just so many organic growth opportunities out there that we're pursuing. That really is the priority. Tom Okray : Yes. And just to punctuate that, Scott, with a number. If you look at our backlog for Electrical and Aerospace back at the end of Q4 in '19, it was roughly a little over $4 billion. And as we said in the prepared remarks, we're at $11 billion now. So there's a lot of food on the table. Operator : The next question is from Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Julian Mitchell : Just wanted to understand on that cash flow guide. I think it's at the midpoint guided up about $900 million year-on-year. Net income is about $300 million, I think, of increase. So that sort of the delta of $600 million there. Is that sort of just the $500 million miss from '22? I'm assuming you capture it in '23. Is that how we should think about it? And maybe on the working capital point, is it all inventory kind of shouldering that delta? Or is receivables or payables doing anything interesting? Tom Okray : Yes. Thanks, Julian. Just a slight nuance in terms of how you characterized it, I mean, while we did miss -- if we go back to that one chart, if we were able to foretell the future perfectly in terms of the order growth in the backlog, we might have guided a different number there. But coming back to the bridge from '22 to '23, in addition to the impact of higher income, it's going to be working capital performance. As we noted in our prepared remarks, we can do a lot better there. It's primarily inventory, but I would tell you it's not just inventory. We think we can do better on DSO and collections. We think we can do better on DPO as well. I think we've got a great continuous improvement focus in this area. We know we're not where we want to be. As we said, we invested prudently, but we can do a lot better, and we will do better this year in terms of net working capital. Julian Mitchell : That's clear. And just my quick follow-up, you talked about the first quarter sort of organic sales segment a little bit. Maybe on the margins. So I think you're calling for the segment margin to drop sequentially about 1 point from fourth quarter into first quarter. Are we assuming kind of every segment has that similar drop and then sort of builds from there through the year? Anything to call out on that front, the sort of margins as we start the year and then move on by segment? Tom Okray : Yes. I don't think there's anything particular to call out. I mean I would take you to our full year guide where we're taking margins and we're growing them 70 bps overall. And we've got margin growth in every single segment. Our EPS cadence is going to match our historical cadence of 45-55 to first half and second half. So I don't think there's anything specific to read into Q1. Craig Arnold : Other than the volume piece, Julian. As you know, there's certain cyclicality that we have in our various businesses. And that's generally the reason why the margins generally drop between Q4 and Q1. And to the extent that we have more cyclicality in one business or the other, you could see a slightly different play-through by segment, but that's really the primary issue. Tom Okray : Yes. And that's a good point, Craig. I think we see that in terms of our aero segment where we go down in Electrical and Electrical Americas as well, too. Craig Arnold : Yes. Operator : The next question is from David Raso from Evercore. David Raso : The quarterly cadence of the organic sales growth, the 9% we discussed in the first quarter, the way you're thinking about the rest of the year, is it all just sort of at the same kind of 7.5% level? I'm just trying to get a sense in particular about some markets where there's a little more concern about a slowdown in the back half then maybe other areas that could be accelerating. So can you first confirm, is that sort of how you think of the cadence? Craig Arnold : Yes. I think that's a fair way to think about the cadence. I mean, I think the great news for us is we're sitting on very large backlogs. And so to the extent that we had a little bit of an air pocket at some place, we can live off of our backlog for a very long time before it would actually impact our revenues. And so I think as we think about the year, we still think it's a year where we're constrained, where -- but for labor constraints, capacity constraints, supply constraints, those numbers would be bigger than what we're currently forecasting. And so I do think a similar pattern of growth is a good placeholder for now in terms of the way you should think about the year. David Raso : And within Vehicle, the thought of auto sort of later in the year and truck later in the year, the interplay there? And a similar question on Electrical Global. Europe so far is proving a bit resilient, how to think about China and Europe in the back half of the year? Just those two interplays in those two divisions. I'll leave it at that. Tom Okray : As I mentioned in my commentary, I think we're incrementally more optimistic on China. They came through COVID much quicker than what we anticipated. And the Zero COVID policy went away overnight, it felt like. And we're starting to see the Chinese government kind of reignite the economy over there. And so I think as the year builds, we think that we -- that China, and therefore, Asia continues to strengthen. It has a relatively better second half than the first half. I think Europe is a little bit more difficult of a call to make. Europe, as you noted, has continued to hang in there and be better than what we anticipated for most of 2022. And we're incrementally, I'd say, sitting here today more positive on 2023. So difficult to really call whether or not we're going to see a different first half versus the second half in Europe. We're kind of planning for steady as she goes and more of a balanced view with respect to the year-over-year growth. Operator : The next question is from Chris Snyder from UBS. Christopher Snyder : Craig, I wanted to follow up on your comment in the prepared remarks that you would be surprised if the company does not beat the 5% to 8% annual growth targets laid out at the Investor Day. Does this just reflect the fact that the company is running so far ahead of these targets? Or do you think forward growth to continue to top this range through 2025? Craig Arnold : Yes. I think, one, to your point, we are certainly running ahead. I mean, if you take a look at, assuming the 2023 guidance is a good number, we've been running around 10% top line growth against the 5% to 8% target. So well ahead on growth. And quite frankly, we've become incrementally more positive on some of these secular growth trends. I think if you take a look at stimulus spending, that number has been topped up since we laid those goals out more than a year ago. I think today, if you think about climate change and some of the investments that are going into grid resiliency -- and so as we sit here today, I would tell you that the secular growth trends that we spent a lot of time talking about, we've become even incrementally more positive on what the longer-term implications are of these secular growth trends. Now that may not play out completely between now and 2025. I think there's going to be some capacity constraints in the industry, and we're already experiencing some of those. That could be a gating factor. But that just gives us a much longer runway on the back end of this thing in terms of what's going to happen with these markets over the long term. Christopher Snyder : Yes. I appreciate that. It certainly feels like it's showing through with the orders and the pipeline. But then kind of on that, obviously, global orders have decelerated. It sounds like the company is decently optimistic on the rate of change and certainly in China. It sounds like maybe even Europe as well. With that, could we actually see global orders reaccelerate in 2023 just given those two economies maybe starting to move in the right direction? Craig Arnold : Yes. I mean, I think it's -- when you say reaccelerate. I think it's a question of relative numbers. We had a very strong year for the most part, a very, very strong first half of the year in our Global business. And we're still anticipating growth, but we are anticipating the rate of growth will have slowed from what we saw in 2022. A lot of that tied to this assumption around a global recession that could hit Europe perhaps more impactfully than it maybe would in other regions of the world. And so it could -- there's a possibility that we could see a reacceleration. That's not our base assumption. We assume that we're going to still see growth but growth at a slower rate. Tom Okray : Yes. Let me just punch some numbers on Global because we talked a lot about Americas, but just to punch a few numbers. For trailing 12-month orders in our Global segment, we have high double digit in commercial and institution. We're over 20% in residential, and data centers is doing significantly well. I mean utility is up high single digits. So very strong growth also in Global, not to the extent of Americas but still very sporty. Operator : And our next question, which is the final one in queue, is from Brett Linzey from Mizuho Americas. Brett Linzey : I wanted to come back to Electrical. So the incremental margins reported 44% in the fourth quarter. You're only guiding about 30% for the year. I'm just curious why Q4 would not be more reflective of an undisturbed result with supply chains resolving and price catching up. So curious if there's something else through the course of '23 or just conservatism. Craig Arnold : Yes. I mean that's the same discussion I'm having with my operating leaders. Why isn't Q4 44% the new normal? And I'd say that, as you can imagine, in every quarter, there's always a number of things that can go positively in your direction and things that could go against you. And we just had a very strong quarter of execution and good mix in our Americas business in Q4 that drove those incrementals to be well above where they would normally run. We do think from a planning standpoint, especially given some of the investments that we need to continue to make to support this growth in R&D and an customer capture initiatives, that we think 30% is the right planning number to have. And as you think about the business on a go-forward basis and very much consistent with where we've been historically. Tom Okray : I'll just end on 30% is good for planning. But we take the coaching, and we don't want to disappoint the Chairman. So we'll work hard to beat that. Brett Linzey : And just one last follow-up. Where are we in this pricing cycle? I mean, is there more to do here? Have you made announcements for this year? And then maybe any context for what you're embedding for the price component of the 7% to 9% growth this year? Craig Arnold : Yes. Certainly, price will be a contributor to the growth for 2023. It obviously contributes at a much lower rate than it's contributed in 2022. And yes, there is some more to do. We are, in fact, expecting to see positive price over the course of the year. We -- today, commodities have certainly slowed their rate of ascent. In some cases, we treat it a little bit, but they're back up again. You see copper is back up again. And the big challenge right now we're finding is really on the labor front. Labor inflation is certainly coming through the system. And so clearly, we still have work to do on the price front, and it's baked into the guidance that we laid out, but it will certainly be at a much lower rate than what we experienced over the course of 2022. And most of what you're seeing in those growth numbers are volume. Yan Jin : We have reached to the end of our call and do appreciate everybody's questions. As always, and I will be available to address your follow-up questions. Thank you for joining us today. Have a great day, guys. Operator : Thank you. And that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Teleconference Service. You may now disconnect.",

Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, your conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Yan Jin. Please, go ahead. Yan Jin : Hi. Good morning. Thank you all for joining us for Eaton's first quarter 2023 earnings call. With me today are Craig Arnold, our Chairman and CEO; and Tom Okray, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our agenda today includes the opening remarks by Craig, then he will turn it over to Tom, who will highlight our company's performance in the first quarter. As we have done on our past calls, we'll be taking questions at the end of Craig\u2019s closing commentary. The press release and the presentation we'll go through today have been posted on our website. This presentation, including adjusted earnings per share, adjusted free cash flow and other non-GAAP measures. They are reconciled in the appendix. A webcast of this call is accessible on our website and will be available for replay. I would like to remind you that our commentary today will include statements related to the expected future results of the company and are therefore forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our forecasted projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and the presentation. With that, I will turn it over to Craig. Craig Arnold : Okay. Thanks, Yan. We'll start with some highlights of the quarter on page three. And I'll lead off by noting that we've delivered another strong quarter. We generated adjusted EPS of $1.88 for the quarter, well above our guidance range, record for the quarter and up 16% from prior year. And we continue to post strong margins. Q1 record of 19.7%, up 90 basis points over prior year. Our sales were $5.5 billion, up 15% organically, our third quarter in a row of 15% organic growth. We have particular strength in our Electrical Americas, which was up more than 20%, including very strong growth in commercial, institutional, utility and data center market. We also had exceptional growth in our Commercial Aerospace and eMobility businesses. Our orders also came in ahead of expectations for the quarter. On a rolling 12-month basis, Electrical orders were up 13% and Aerospace orders increased by 21% and which led to another quarter of record backlogs, up 39% for Electrical and 27% for Aerospace. I think it's well understood at this point, but I'd note once again that reindustrialization, infrastructure spending, along with secular growth trends of electrification, energy transition and digitalization have fundamentally changed the growth prospects for our company. Lastly, free cash flow in the quarter was nearly $300 million, driven by higher net income and improved working capital. So I'd say a good start to the year that keeps us on track to deliver our free cash flow guidance despite higher revenue and receivable balances. So on balance, I'd say, we're off to a very good start for the year. Moving to page four. I'd like to once again highlight that Eaton is marking its 100th anniversary of our listing on the New York Stock Exchange. And as many of you saw, we celebrated by ringing the bell on in early March. Eaton is one of 32 companies who have reached this milestone. And I'd say our longevity on the exchange and our resiliency is really a function of our ability to adapt to a changing world. But what has remained constant over that time is the spirit of innovation that guides us and our commitment to all of our stakeholders, our employees, our customers, our shareholders, communities and all of society. Now as Eaton stands at the forefront of perhaps the most significant growth trends that we'll see in our lifetime, we're convinced that our best days are still ahead of us. And we've been busy planning for this moment. As we look at Eaton today, we position ourselves as our customers' trusted partner across power management spectrum. And slide 5 provides a good example of how we're playing across the electrical value chain from power generation to power distribution, to how it's consumed in various applications. We're building a business that supports our customers with a full range of end-to-end solutions beginning with deep domain expertise in specific applications and the ability to specify electrical solutions, we're now providing intelligent electrical products, offering Data as a Service, providing software solutions, doing installation commissioning and providing aftermarket services. Our role has changed from simply selling components to helping owners fulfill their changing energy needs. We're also proving that we can leverage our technology and create scale solutions that serve all of our end markets. For those of you who are with us at our March meeting in New York, you saw an example of this and a new product we call Breaktor. Breaktor is a combination of a breaker and a contactor, we developed the technology in our Electrical business and have successfully sold it in our eMobility and aerospace businesses. And as the electrification of everything continues, the need for Eaton's technology and solutions will certainly continue to grow. And the primary source of this growth is coming from the mega trends that we've discussed. In addition to electrification, we're benefiting from energy transition from digitalization and the reindustrialization of the US and European market, and we're seeing record capital spending levels. And as you know, this capital is being supported by an unprecedented level of infrastructure spending by governments around the world. And while early, we're tracking a large number of infrastructure-related projects. For example, in our Electrical Americas business, we've already seen over $1 billion of projects and have won roughly $250 million of orders. And as this chart reflects, we're also at the beginning of a strong aerospace growth cycle and seeing rapid adoption of electric vehicles. Collectively, these trends have positioned the company for strong growth for the foreseeable future. Next, on page 7 of the presentation, we provide an example of how reindustrialization is creating a record number of mega projects, and we define a major project as a project with more than $1 billion of capital. Since 2021, announced non-residential mega projects have a cumulative value of almost $600 billion, at least 3x the historical run rate for non-residential projects. And this is North America only. $600 billion announced over the last nine quarters, $400 billion more than historical run rate. These projects are certainly in various phases of design, planning or construction. But as you can see, these secular trends are translating into specific projects, and they haven't slowed down. There's billions more in the planning stages, which will certainly sustain our growth for years to come. On slide 8, we take you from the $400 billion of announced mega projects and what it means for the electrical industry. We estimate that the electrical content on these projects is in a range of 3% to 5% of the total project value. This suggests $12 billion to $20 billion of incremental electrical revenue. Keep in mind, there's certainly a wide range of electrical content on various projects, and our exposure is tied more closely to building infrastructure. But assuming these projects get planned designed and built over the next five to seven years, they will expand the electrical market by some $2 billion to $4 billion a year. And that's just from what's been already announced in mega projects, we naturally expect more large and small projects to come. I'd say these projects are a good example of how mega trends are playing out in creating a very different growth outlook for the electrical industry and one, we think will run a decade or more. Another helpful proof point is represented on slide nine, where you can see how our negotiation pipeline has grown. As you can see, our negotiation pipeline has doubled from what we've seen historically. In 2022, we saw nearly $5 billion of projects in our negotiation pipeline in Electrical Americas alone. And similar to mega projects, we're seeing broad strength in manufacturing and data center, industrial and utility market. This large step-up in negotiation is further supported. Our expectations, further supports our expectations for strong markets and faster organic growth, as we go forward. And just one additional proof point is noted on page 10. Here, we show a few examples of how these projects are translating into specific orders. As we reported, our electric orders have been at record levels for two years now. So, what we're demonstrating here is how these mega projects are translating directly into large wins for our Electrical business. For example, we've won $180 million of orders to provide toll management solutions for two new EV plants in North America. Specifically, we're providing power distribution equipment and bright layer industrial remote monitoring software. Another example is a $100 million order for a new US semiconductor plant, and we're already working on Phase 2 of this project, which could be even larger. So overall, we're seeing record project announcements, record negotiations, a record set of orders that has led to record backlog. And keep in mind, the revenue impact is mostly in front of us. Moving to page 11. We're also benefiting from mega trends in Aerospace and Vehicle. We're at the beginning of an Aerospace growth cycle in both commercial and defense market. Specifically, Commercial OEM build rates are expected to grow in the mid-teens over the next several years. And our commercial aftermarket should also grow by double digits, as global revenues [ph] passenger kilometers continue to recover to pre-pandemic levels and beyond. We've also noted the significant step-up in defense orders and expect to see a significant lift in defense revenues beginning in 2024. As a point of reference, our defense orders have more than doubled from 2019 levels. And in recent years, we've run increased content on both Commercial and Defense platforms. In vehicle, electrification continues to accelerate, and we now expect global EV penetration rates to exceed 50% of global auto sales by 2030, up from our prior estimate of 40%. While we're not providing any new revenue updates today, we once again are relooking our forecast for our eMobility segment. And on page 12, we highlighted a few key wins in our Aerospace and eMobility businesses beginning with a $500 million win for cryogenic coolers and controllers for the CityAirbus urban air mobility program. The CityAirbus win is a good example of how digitalization, software and electrification are beginning to benefit our Aerospace business. And as Tom will report shortly, we're seeing more than 30% growth in our defense and commercial aftermarket orders. And in eMobility, we continue to realize significant wins. The most significant of which are coming from our power distribution product line within our eMobility business, you'll recall this is where we're able to leverage our broader electrical business and our unique breakthrough technology. Our latest set of wins comes from a leading European automotive OEM and will generate $100 million a year of mature year revenues. So like Electrical, our industrial businesses are delivering significant wins tied to long-term mega trends that will support faster growth. When you combine the businesses, we're confident that our market should grow at more than 2x their historical rates. And as we've stated, we're in the early innings. These trends are expected to deliver outside growth for years to come. With that, I'll turn it over to Tom to walk us through Q1 financial results and updated guidance. Tom Okray : Thanks, Craig. On page 13, I'll start by providing a summary of our strong Q1 results. For the third consecutive quarter, we generated organic growth of 15%. Revenue was up 13%, with the organic growth reduced by two percentage points of unfavorable foreign exchange. Operating profit, a first quarter record grew 19% and margins expanded 90 basis points to 19.7%, also a Q1 record. Adjusted EPS increased by 16% over the prior year to $1.88. All-in, the strong organic growth and margins enabled us to report a first quarter record adjusted EPS. Our higher growth not only demonstrates the mega trends, but also the importance of prioritizing our customers by carrying higher levels of inventory when supply chains were challenged. Lastly, our free cash flow of $209 million was nearly $300 million above prior year and exceeded our expectations. You will recall from our Q4 call, we expected free cash flow to be relatively flat year-over-year. Moving on to the next chart. Our Electrical Americas business had another very strong quarter. We have set Q1 records for sales, operating profit and margin. Organic sales growth was 22%. Electrical Americas has generated double-digit organic growth for five consecutive quarters, including back-to-back quarters of at least 20% growth. On a two-year stack, organic growth is up 32%. In the quarter, there was broad-based growth in all end markets, with especially robust growth in commercial and institutional, utility and data center market. Specifically, we posted 25% organic growth in our data center revenues in Q1. So we continue to see very strong growth in this important market. Utility and commercial and institutional were up more than 30%. It's also worth noting that we posted strong revenue growth of 17% in our residential business. The two-year stack is over 40% growth. We're seeing strength in multi-family homes, completion of single-family homes in process and increased electrical content per home, which are more than offsetting weakness in new single-family start. Operating margin of 22.9% and was up 380 basis points versus prior year, benefiting from higher volumes. Incremental margins were very strong at more than 40%. We continue to manage price effectively to more than offset inflationary pressures. Orders and backlog show continued strength. On a rolling 12-month basis, orders were up 18%, which remains at a high level with particular strength in data center, distributed IT, utility and industrial market. On a quarter-over-quarter sequential basis, orders grew 19%. We're also continuing to build backlog. Backlog was up 51% versus prior year and up 9% sequentially. In addition to the robust trends in orders and backlog, our major project negotiations pipeline in Q1 was up more than 20% versus prior year and nearly 20% sequentially from especially strong growth in data center, water, wastewater and transportation market. Overall, Electrical Americas had a very strong quarter to start the year. On Page 15, you'll find the results of our Electrical Global segment which, posted all-time record sales of $1.5 billion. Organic growth was up 8%, which was partially offset by headwinds from foreign exchange and a divestiture. Organic growth was driven by strength in utility, data center and distributed IT market. Our data center revenues for Electrical Global increased 32% in the quarter, utility was up 25% and distributed IT up 20%. Operating margin of 18.3% was down compared to prior year. Primarily from manufacturing inefficiencies and investment in growth, partially offset by higher sales volume and inflationary price recovery. Orders were up 4% on a rolling 12-month basis with strength in data center, commercial and institutional and utility market. Sequentially, orders grew 12%. Backlog increased 3% year-over-year and 6% sequentially. I'm also pleased to highlight that last month, we closed the acquisition of a 49% stake in Jiangsu Ryan Electrical Company. This is a Chinese-based business with approximately $100 million of revenue, which manufactures power distribution and sub-transmission transformers and will accelerate Eaton's growth in renewable energy, data center, utility and industrial market. This is Eaton's fourth JV in China in the last two years, allowing us to expand our market presence, serving high-growth markets inside and outside of China. Before moving to our Industrial businesses, I'd like to briefly recap the combined Electrical segment. For Q1, we posted organic growth of 16%, incremental margin of 34% and operating margin of 21%, which was 180 basis points of year-over-year margin improvement. Orders grew 13% on a rolling 12-month basis, with sequential growth in the quarter of nearly 20% compared roughly -- compared to roughly flat sequential order growth in the six years prior to the pandemic. Backlog grew 39% in the quarter and 8% sequentially. On a rolling 12-month basis, our book-to-bill for our electrical sector remains very strong at above 1.2. It was also above 1.2 for Q1. We remain confident in our positioning for continued growth with strong margins in our overall Electrical business. The next page recaps our Aerospace segment. We posted Q1 record for sales and operating profit. Organic growth was 13%, with a one percentage point headwind from foreign exchange. Growth was primarily driven by strength in Commercial aftermarket, up more than 30% and commercial OEM, up more than 25%. Operating margin was 22.5%, which was 40 basis points over last year, driven by volume growth and inflationary price recovery. Order growth in backlog trends also remain encouraging. On a rolling 12-month basis, orders were up 21% organically with strength across all end markets, including continued outgrowth in defense OEM orders. Similar to the second half of the year, we continue to see -- a second half of last year, we continue to see strong growth in our defense orders in the quarter with OEM, up 55% and aftermarket, up more than 40%. On a rolling 12-month basis, our book-to-bill for our Aerospace segment remains very strong at more than 1.2 including more than 1.25 for Q1. Year-over-year backlog growth increased 27% in Q1, an acceleration from up 21% in Q4. Moving on to our Vehicle segment on Page 17. In Q1, revenue was up 10%, with 11% organic growth and 1 percentage point of unfavorable FX. We saw particular strong growth in both the Americas and EMEA market. Operating margins came in at 14.5%, with unfavorability to prior year, primarily due to manufacturing inefficiencies, partially offset by higher sales volume and price cost. We continue to make progress towards securing more sustainable technology wins, which most recently includes multiple new programs for our ePowertrain solution. On Page 18, we show results for our eMobility business. We generated strong growth in the quarter. Revenue was up 17%, including 18% from organic growth. Margin was down 30 basis points versus prior year, driven by higher manufacturing start-up costs associated with new electric vehicle programs. We remain very encouraged by the growth prospects of the eMobility segment. We continue to leverage our capabilities across our entire portfolio, including core technology in both electrical and industrial businesses. Since 2018, we have won $1.4 billion of mature year revenues in this business with many of these programs ramping up in 2023 and 2024. This strong momentum includes additional recent wins with Breaktor, including on next-generation battery platforms with a large European OEM. Next, on page 19, we show historical backlog charts for the Electrical sector and Aerospace segments. We think it's important to illustrate how backlog has grown over time. Our record backlog was roughly $12 billion to end Q1. This is up nearly three times the ending 2019 level. These metrics provide us with great confidence in the outlook for the full year and going forward. On the next page, we show our fiscal year organic growth and operating margin guidance. We are raising our organic growth guidance for 2023. We continue to have a robust negotiations pipeline and build backlog with particular strength in Electrical Americas and Aerospace. We now expect organic growth in Electrical Americas of 11% to 13%, up 300 basis points from our prior 8% to 10% guide. We're also raising Electrical Global 200 basis points to 6% to 8% from 4% to 6%. And we're increasing Aerospace 200 basis points to 10% to 12% from 8% to 10%. In total, we're increasing our 2023 organic outlook by 200 basis points from an 8% midpoint to a 10% midpoint. Our strong end market growth forecast combined with building backlog provides tremendous visibility and confidence in this 2023 outlook. For segment margins, we're raising our guidance range for Electrical Americas by 20 basis points to a revised range of 23.3% to 23.7%, which reflects the continued strong momentum that we have in this business. Overall, we are reaffirming our total Eaton margin guidance range of 20.7% to 21.1%. As a reminder, this is a 70 basis point increase at the midpoint from our 2022 all-time record margin. For eMobility, we are adjusting both the organic growth and margin ranges. This is primarily due to delayed OEM launch plans and higher start-up costs related to large new program wins. In summary, we continue to be well positioned to deliver another strong year of financial performance. On page 21, we have the balance of our guidance for 2023 and Q2. Following our strong Q1 performance and improved organic growth expectations for the year, we are raising our full year EPS range to $8.30 to $8.50. At the midpoint of $8.40, we have raised guidance by $0.16. This represents 11% growth in adjusted EPS in 2023. We're also raising our CapEx guidance from $630 million to approximately $700 million to fund additional investments for growth, including in our utility business, where we continue to experience strong increases. Free cash flow guidance remains unchanged. For Q2, we are guiding organic growth of 10% to 12%. Segment margins of between 20.5% and 20.9%, representing 60 basis points growth at the midpoint versus prior year, and adjusted EPS in the range of $2.04 to $2.14, and a 12% increase versus prior year at the midpoint. Now, I'll hand it back to Craig to wrap-up the presentation. Craig Arnold : Thanks, Tom. Now, turning to page 22. As we continue to track our end markets, we want to provide a slightly rise look at our assumptions for the year. Once again, we do expect a mild recession 2023, and we've built that into our base case assumptions. But with healthy demand and strong secular growth trends, we continue to expect growth in almost all of our end markets, and we raised our growth assumption for the utility market from solid growth to strong double-digit growth. Here, energy transition and electrification continue to gain momentum. And we've increased our residential market from declining to flat. So while we recognize the slowdown in US single-family housing market, the combination of resilient renovation market, pricing momentum and strong backlog now supports an upward revision. And as Tom noted, we posted a 17% organic growth in residential in Electrical Americas in Q1. The balance of the forecast remains unchanged, and but I want to emphasize once again that despite market concerns about non-resident construction market, we have a robust negotiation pipeline, a growing backlog and strong orders. Data centers, utility, industrial, commercial institutions continued to perform extremely well. And I know that most of you have drawn reference to the declining PMI data, but I'd point out that our market and revenue growth are much more aligned with capital spending where we continue to see strong momentum. As a result, we do not expect any of our end markets to decline in 2023, and most are expected to see healthy levels of growth. Let me close on page 23 with just a few summary comments. Once again, we delivered a strong quarter and set a handful of Q1 record. We delivered 15% organic growth and have record backlog. While electric orders are experiencing some expected normalization, our supply chains continue to improve, the secular growth trends and strong execution on our backlog support another strong year of growth. Having exceeded our Q1 forecast and continued secular tailwinds, we're raising our guidance for the year. Despite macro uncertainty in markets -- despite macro uncertainties, our markets are performing well, and we're improving our internal execution. And as I highlighted, we're seeing more evidence that mega trends are accelerating. And we now think our end markets will grow at more than 2x historical growth rate. These market forces are just beginning to show up in revenue and will position the company for strong growth for the decade to come. I'll stop here and open it up for any questions you may have. Yan Jin : Thanks, Craig. For the Q&A today, please limit your opportunity to just one question and a follow-up. Thanks in advance for your corporation. With that, I will turn it over to the operator to give you guys the instruction. Q - Joe Ritchie : Thanks. Good morning everyone, and great start to the year. Craig Arnold : Good morning, Joe. Thank you. Joe Ritchie : Let me just kind of start on the Electrical Americas margins. Clearly, a standout this quarter. I think your highest quarter -- highest first quarter ever. As you think about kind of like the incremental margins going forward, it looks like you posted about a 40% incremental in the first quarter. How should we be thinking about the rest of the year? Are there any items that potentially reverse as you progress, or do you expect incrementals to be as strong throughout the year? Craig Arnold : We appreciate the recognition, Joe. And our team in the Americas is just doing an outstanding job of executing. And as we talked about last year, we had a fairly sizable inefficiencies in our manufacturing operations, as we were dealing with a number of supply chain related disruptions. And so those got clearly better into the first quarter. And we would expect that, as we go forward, while the incrementals for the company, we're still calling the company in and around 30%. We do expect our Americas business to perform better than that, as we continue to see improvements in supply chain. Tom Okray : Yes. And the only thing I would throw on top of that, Joe is -- to your specific question, there were no unusual items in the first quarter driving the Americas margin. Joe Ritchie : Got it. That's super helpful. And look, Craig, you outlined a lot of reasons to be excited about the growth dynamics for the companies going forward. I saw you took up the utilities expectation for the year. I'm curious, are you starting to see some of the money loosen from the Jobs Act, particularly on the flip side, or what's kind of driving your increased expectations on utilities growth for the year? Craig Arnold : Yes. I mean, this is something that had been long anticipated, quite frankly, Joe, by us is, as you think about all of these mega trends of whether it's electrification of the economy or energy transition, we knew at some point, the utility market would have to start to make the kinds of investments that are going to be needed to support the electrification of the economy. As I mentioned, I think, on the last earnings call, one of the longest lead time pieces of equipment that you could order today in the electrical industry is a transformer. And in many cases, lead times there are 12 months or beyond. And so we continue to see the utilities making investments in their distribution infrastructure to really support this energy transition that's taking place, the electrification of the economy. And so yes, we think the utility market is going to be a really strong growth market for some years to come as they deal with needed investments. And so no question, as we began the year, we were a little bit conservative in terms of what the expectation is, but it's coming through, as you heard from Tom and since some of the orders growth, orders growth are quite significant now, and we think that's going to go on once again for some years to come. Joe Ritchie : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Josh Pokrzywinski from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Josh Pokrzywinski : Hi, good morning, guys. Craig Arnold : Hey, Josh. Josh Pokrzywinski : So good to see that supply chain looks like it's starting to unlock there in Electrical. I guess, even though it's not as bad today, maybe labor with the -- either in your plans or maybe on the installer side or somewhere else in some of these bigger projects might still be a limiting factor. Craig, I guess if you just sort of take a step back, notwithstanding the current backlog, demand is really good, all those sorts of things. Is there sort of a cap on how fast the industry can grow thinking about kind of the totality of the supply chain, including that labor pool at the contractor level? Craig Arnold : No, I appreciate the question, Josh. And that's certainly one of the things that we're spending a lot of time trying to sort through right now. I mean clearly, as I mentioned, supply chain on the material side from our suppliers has improved. We're not out of the woods by any means, especially when you think about electronic and semiconductor-related components. They still are constrained constraining our growth. But to your point, labor is also a fairly significant constraint today. And so one of the reasons why I think you've seen this big gap between orders and revenue is because, once again, our extended supply chain and labor availability have been constraints on the industry. I don't really have an answer to your direct question in terms of -- from an industry perspective, what's the limiter because as you know, in these very complicated supply chains, it only takes one supplier, one player in the market to become the constraining factor. So it's a great question and one that we're trying to spend some time thinking through, but not one today that we have a really clear answer to today in terms of what is the real upper boundary of the industry's ability to deliver given labor, given our standard supply chains and some of these material constraints. I can tell you that today, things are getting better across the board. And we're feeling much better about the growth outlook for our company and for the industry and just tons of positives that we talked about in our opening commentary, where we're seeing significant broad-based strength and it's showing up in our backlog, they're showing up on our order books. And we would hope that we continue to post very strong revenue growth tied to these secular trends. Josh Pokrzywinski : Got it. That's helpful. And I understand it's not an easy question to answer just yet. Maybe shifting over to the pipeline for my follow-up. Anything you can share in terms of the book out rate and maybe any churn that you see in that pipeline with things like financing, supply chain, all these stimulus projects, some of which I would imagine are kind of mutually exclusive. Is there -- has there been any underlying volatility in that? And how should we think about the lead time between when something enters the pipeline and then maybe transmits into backlog? Craig Arnold : Yes. No, I appreciate the question. And it's -- I mean there's a lot in the question that you asked very specific in terms of whether or not we're seeing a lot of churn. I'd say that, overall, economic activity, whether it's negotiations or orders or revenue, everything is kind of doing significantly better than it has historically and certainly better than even, quite frankly, we anticipated when we put our plan together for the year. So in general, things are positive. And we continue to -- with more negotiations, with more orders than we anticipated, obviously translating into more revenue. So, I'd say that stimulus specifically, we talked about that a little bit in some of the opening commentary. We are starting to see stimulus have an impact. We are in the very early innings. If you think about that $600 billion of projects, mega projects that we talked about, we think some 25% of that has already broken ground and started many of that, whether it's semiconductors or EV factories and battery factors are obviously being busters by some of the early Infrastructure Spending Act. The inflation Reduction Act, we really have not seen any impact from that yet. We're certainly seeing some impact from the Semiconductor Act. So yes, a little bit of a mixed bag there, but I'd say most of the impact there continues to be out in front of us and lead times today on these projects I would say, we have better visibility today, as these projects are bigger, they tend to run them over a multiyear period. And so we're feeling great about our visibility into the future, because of these very large projects that will be delivered over multiple years. But I'd say\u2026 Josh Pokrzywinski : Hey that\u2019s great color. Tom Okray : Yes. The only part that I would amplify on that is going back to our speaker remarks, our negotiation pipeline in the US quarter-over-quarter is up almost 25% year-over-year, up almost 25%. And some of the big segments are up well over 30% growth. So, we're seeing very robust pipeline here. Josh Pokrzywinski : Got it. Appreciate it guys. Tom Okray : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Scott Davis from Melius Research. Please go ahead. Scott Davis : Good morning, Craig and Tom. How are you? Look, how -- I want to just fixate on these big projects because this is so new, at least since I've been covering this space. Maybe a couple of different angles to go out here. One is just the competitive dynamic. Does it change when you get to this size? Meaning, there's just a lot less people that can really at least be trusted suppliers for the customer when you're talking about orders and $10-plus million up to $100 million kind of total bid stuff? Craig Arnold : Yes. I mean first of all, we acknowledge what you just said, Scott, these -- we've always had mega projects, but historically speaking, they've been relatively few and far between. But I think it's really -- if you go back to this broader theme that we talked about around reindustrialization of manufacturing in the US for sure, to a certain extent also in Europe. This is resulting in a really, let's say, a big surge of investing in the manufacturing sector in the US. And to the point that you raised, the bigger the project, the more complex the project, the fewer companies who are able to essentially provide the services that our customers need. And so we think the competitive dynamic in this environment certainly favors companies like Eaton because of our large capable organization. And quite frankly, in general, when you think about the more complex projects in general, they're also more electric intensive. If you think about a typical office building versus a typical semiconductor plant or an EV factory, the electrical intensity or a data center, the electrical intensity of these applications is much greater than a typical strip mall or office building, which also helps support the underlying growth of the industry and companies like Eaton. So we think it's certainly -- it's an important trend that's going to drive growth for the industry, but should also allow our companies to grow at a faster rate. Tom Okray : And I think it really gives another lens in terms with these big projects, focused not so much on the PMIs, which we've all read historically. And to Craig's point, this reindustrialization, which is driven by these higher levels of CapEx, which we just don't see slowing down. Scott Davis : Yes. Helpful. And then just to back up a little bit, when you talk about selling less traditional products and let's just say, like software/remote monitoring, et cetera. Is that a separate sales process into facilities like this? Is it the same? I mean, I'm kind of picturing a EPC firm putting out a bit, but this is a little bit of a different animal. So how is the sales process really change and evolve with this type of unique product? Craig Arnold : Yes, we've spent some time with you over the years talking about the way we think about the sale of software to state of data and insights to that. For us, we really do think it's linked to the equipment. And so for us, for the most part, we're selling products that are digitally enabled. They're digitally native. These products all have the ability to stream data. From that data, we create algorithms and that allow us to provide insights, from the data coming off of our products, and we can either monetize that either in the form of Data as a Service or software. So for us, and it's not the same for every company in this space, we do link the sale of hardware, the places where we have deep domain knowledge and expertise to the sale of data and software and these services that we bundle together. So for us in the way we go to market, we do go together through the same channel through the same decision point. But that's not the same for every company in the space. Scott Davis : Its very helpful. Thank you. Best of luck guys. Craig Arnold : Thanks, Scott. Operator : The next question is from Nicole DeBlase from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Nicole DeBlase : Yes. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Craig Arnold : Good morning. Nicole DeBlase : Just maybe starting with the second quarter outlook for organic growth, embedding a bit of a deceleration from the 15% in the first quarter. Just can you talk a little bit about what's driving that deceleration from a segment perspective? Craig Arnold : Yes. I'd say that there's always a bit of uncertainty, Nicole, as you can imagine, when you look forward in terms of where you think the market is going to land. But one of the things that I'd say is clearly, if you look at the balance between price and volume as you move forward for the balance of the year, you get relatively smaller contributions from year-over-year price increase, and you get, obviously, a pretty significant contribution from volume. And so you clearly have that dynamic that's taken place in the business throughout the year and inclusive of the second quarter. So we'll see. I mean, at this point, we're early days into Q2 we're off to a good start here. And so if we're able to convert and we continue to have some of the supply chain issues resolved. Certainly, we have a range of possibilities for the quarter. It could be better. But at this point, I'd say we're taking a prudent view based upon the fact that we're not out of the woods completely from a supply chain standpoint. And once again, I mentioned less price on a relative year-over-year basis than we certainly had in Q1. Nicole DeBlase : Got it. That makes sense. Thanks, Craig. And then second question, just update on what you're seeing with respect to channel inventory in Electrical? Still pretty low relative to history or any movement there in the past quarter? Thank you. Craig Arnold : Yeah. We think today, channel inventories are actually in relatively good shape, obviously, with some spots where they would like more and I think when you look at channel inventory, I think probably the most important message that I can leave with the group is that you really got to look at those inventories in the context of the size of the backlog in the context of the orders, if you're looking backwards, you're going to drive one conclusion with respect to inventories. If you're looking forward, you're going to draw a very different conclusion. And it's one of the things that we tried to express for our own company in our Q1 earnings call, where Tom laid out some of the ratios between inventory and backlog, inventory and orders to say that. They're actually below where they've been historically based upon a forward view of our industry and our markets. And so today, I'd just say inventories in general are generally speaking, in good shape. Our distributors today, where I'm having phone calls and discussions with distributors, it's 90% of the time, it's about I need more. Can you help me solve a particular issue I have today with a customer because I don't have enough inventory. But in general, I'd say they're in fairly good shape. We did see a little bit of an issue in the fourth quarter in Europe, where there was a little bit of destocking in Europe in the fourth quarter. That -- since that time, turned around. And as Europe has performed better than even we anticipated. So on balance, inventories are in good shape. Nicole DeBlase : Thanks. I\u2019ll pass it on. Operator : Thank you. And the next question is from the line of Steve Volkmann from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Steve Volkmann : Great. Good morning, guys. Thanks for fitting me in here. Craig, sort of a big picture question based on sort of what you were just saying. Do you think these backlog levels the new Eaton and we should think about Eaton operating with these types of backlog numbers going forward, or do you think as the world sort of normalizes from supply chain or whatever that backlog will come back down again? Craig Arnold : It's a great question, and it's not one once again, but I could tell you that I have clarified well thought through answer to specifically. We certainly, as we think about for 2023, we don't anticipate reducing backlogs. We think we'll carry the same level of backlog throughout much of 2023. A lot of that will have to do with obviously lead times and whether or not we can actually get out in front of some of these ramps that are taking place in the industries and the markets that we serve. And can we get capacity online quick enough to reduce lead times, so that we can go back to perhaps where we've been historically in terms of stated lead times to our customers. And so we're not there today. And I do think a lot of it will be a function of how the markets unfold not just in terms of demand level, because demand level, I think we know is going to be strong, but how quickly can we and others put capacity in to support this higher level of growth. Tom Okray : Steve, where I would chime in on that. I think it's connected. Your question was backlog, but I think the new Eaton is definitely a higher growth Eaton. And as Craig said in his prepared remarks, we see the markets doubling over where they have been historically. And that's a big thing when you say doubling and that doesn't include our outgrowth that we think we can put on top of that. And just some perspective, if you look also at order growth that we've got going back to the first quarter of 2019 there, there's such strong numbers. Electrical Americas growing about 50% in terms of their quarterly orders, Electrical Global up over 25%, and aero up over 40%. So just a volume of quarterly orders that we're seeing coming in and the continued building of the backlog, I think the new Eaton is a much higher growth Eaton. Steve Volkmann : Great. Thank you for that. And then switching gears to Aerospace. We haven't talked about that one too much. But just kind of reading from the commentary on this call and others that I've heard you guys talk about it. It feels like 2024 may be like a real stair step for your aerospace business. I think you mentioned, Craig, that you have a bunch of military business that sort of ramps up. I'm just curious if we should be thinking that there's kind of a bigger increase in revenue and margin in 2024 than might normally kind of be the year-to-year case. Craig Arnold : I think it's certainly early for us to be putting out guidance for 2024. We'll have an opportunity to do that obviously later in the year. But I -- but your thesis is not off the mark. We do believe that certainly on the commercial side, that industry continues to ramp, both Airbus and Boeing have already put out numbers in terms of increases in line rates for [Technical Difficulty] is improving. Consumers are getting on planes. Revenue passenger miles and kilometers continue to grow, up, I think, some 60%, I think, in Q1, still not back to 2019 levels. So there's a long way to go just to get back to 2019 on revenue passenger miles, which, as you know, drives the aftermarket for us. And then on the military side, huge growth in orders this year that will begin to be delivered most of them into 2024. So I think the setup for our Aerospace business is certainly quite favorable right now, and we'll certainly be in a position later in the year to give you an indication of how good we think it's going to be. Steve Volkmann : I appreciate the color. Thanks. Craig Arnold : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And the next question is from Nigel Coe from Wolfe. Please go ahead. Nigel Coe : Thanks. Good morning guys. Thanks for the question. Craig Arnold : Good morning, Nigel. Nigel Coe : I do want to come back to this -- these mega projects. But before we get into that quickly, just global margins, you went through the investments -- maybe just pick back going in on Global, what we're seeing in some of the major markets and what gets better from a margin perspective to get to that 19.7% full year? Craig Arnold : Yes, I'd say the big thing that gets better to get to the higher margins is, one, you're getting to higher volumes, and you're obviously delivering an incremental, but I say the single biggest one is as we talked about last year, we had fairly significant manufacturing inefficiencies in the business last year. Given the supply chain challenges, lots of people standing around in factories waiting for components that didn't show up on time and lots of expedited freight and logistics costs and so we -- despite the fact that we had a record year of profitability in 2022, we had a year of record inefficiencies as well. And so if I had to put it on one thing that's going to get better and it is getting better, it's really the elimination of many of these manufacturing inefficiencies that we've experienced over the last 12 to 18 months or so. Nigel Coe : Okay. Volumes and more positive, that makes sense. And then at the risk of beating debt holes going back to the $600 million of megaprojects. In a very general sense, roughly what percentage of those have been bid on and awarded at this point? You said the majority haven't. So just wondering how that looks. And then what's your win rate? Your market share in the US, North America is about 3%, how does your win rate competitive that bogey? Craig Arnold : Yeah. As I said, on these mega products, these are all announced projects. And as I said, we said 25% of them are actually broken ground and are under construction. And I'd say that our underlying win rate on these mega projects is essentially pretty much at/or above the underlying market share for the company overall. So we've been very pleased with our success rate. As we talked about earlier, the bigger the project, the more complex the project, the higher the likelihood that we would be selected. And so the underlying win rate on these projects -- and keep in mind, these products will be delivered over the next, let's say, three to seven years. And so it's got they have a fairly long tail on them. So I wouldn't necessarily expect to see big movements in the near-term based upon these projects. But the underlying win rate is good, and the underlying profitability is also good. Tom Okray : The only thing I would amplify that for the given quarter, we were actually materially above our share win rate. So yeah, we're doing well in terms of closing the deal. Nigel Coe : That\u2019s helpful. Thanks guys. Operator : The next question is from Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Please go ahead. Julian Mitchell : Thanks. Good morning. Maybe just my first question would be around a lot of electrical equipment manufacturers and broader multi-industry ones have had very disproportionate price tailwinds to revenue in Q1 and a very, very substantive price cost margin tailwind as well in Q1. So I just wondered on those two points, how do you see the pace of normalization of those two tailwinds over the next 12 months? Craig Arnold : Yeah. I'd say -- if we look at our own business, Julian, I'd say that price versus cost, I mean, while commodity costs are certainly down versus where they were a year ago commodity costs, in many cases, are actually up versus where they were in the fourth quarter. Take a look at steel, for example, a major commodity process steel, it's actually down about 25% from a year ago, but it's actually up 25% from where it was in the fourth quarter. So you have a mixed bag there. And then also on the labor side, as you can imagine, we're seeing more labor inflation in the business today. And so in our own company, the price versus volume piece may be is not as significant as it is for others. But I would say that as we look forward and embedded in our guidance is mostly, it's around volume at normal incrementals and the elimination of a lot of the inefficiencies that are in the business that's going to ultimately drive the growth in earnings and the growth in our margins more than it is this relationship between price and cost. As we said, from a strategic standpoint, we don't think price is either additive or subtractive from the underlying margin rates of the business, and that's the way we manage the company. Tom Okray : Yeah. What I would add, Julian is we don't see ourselves losing business because of our price cost either. We're not getting feedback from our sales organization that we've got too much price. We just think we're managing effectively. Julian Mitchell : That's helpful. And then just my quick follow-up. Craig, you mentioned those inefficiencies just now, and those are most apparent in the first quarter's margins Electrical Global I think Vehicle. As we go through the year, we should see those margins kind of start to expand year-on-year. Just wondered when does that happen for the two segments? Is it as soon as the second quarter or it's more kind of the second half is when the margins expand in EG and vehicle? Craig Arnold : We would expect to see progress, Julian, in each quarter. I mean, without a doubt, those are the two places where we had some challenges specifically in inefficiencies, and we would expect then in each of the subsequent quarters to see our businesses get sequentially better. Tom Okray : For sure. And not to get too much into the accounting, but what we're seeing from last year rolled through the P&L in the first quarter and muted the margins somewhat because it was coming off of the balance sheet. So, it should be a tailwind going forward. Julian Mitchell : That's great. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Chris Snyder from UBS. Please go ahead. Chris Snyder : Thank you. Craig, you mentioned a few times that the secular drivers coming through are pushing market growth 2x above historical levels. Is this a 2023, 2024 comment, or do you believe that the 2x market growth rate is not the long-term view? And with that, can you just kind of quantify what the 2x uplift means for market growth from here? Thank you. Craig Arnold : Yeah. There's no question. It is the long-term view. As you think about most of the secular trends that we're talking about, whether it's energy transition, the move to renewables, the electrification of the economy, whether it's cars or cooking appliances or equipment in your factories. The growth in digital and data and connectivity, reindustrialization, you think about all the investment that needs to go into the US market as an example, to basically reinvest in manufacturing had had moved offshore and the stimulus dollars that are all supporting that. So this is clearly our long-term view that we think our markets would grow at least not 2x, but at least 2x the historical growth rates. And so we think those growth rates for the markets are in the mid-single-digit range. Chris Snyder : Thank you. I appreciate that. And then if I want to -- just my follow-up on the US mega projects, and just broader domestic investment. There's been a focus of the administration to drive higher domestic content on projects or infrastructure, where the government is providing incentives. Does this have a material benefit for Eaton as a US manufacturer and could it allow the company to take higher share or even maybe just protect margins or support margins on these mega projects relative to prior cycles? Thank you. Craig Arnold : Yes. What I would tell you is that, where we get the most direct benefit is the fact that we tend to have higher market shares in the US. Most of the global electrical companies that we compete with around the world; they also have fairly much localized much of what they do. But our US market shares just tend to be higher. And so, we'll get an unfair share of projects as this reindustrialization and manufacturing takes place in the US market. Chris Snyder : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from David Raso from Evercore ISI. Please, go ahead. David Raso :  -- so the growth rate exiting 2023. Just for the framework of how you're laying out your organic sales growth. Is it right to assume 15% first quarter, you're saying 11% for the second quarter and then the back half of the year is about 7%. So let's call it 8% in the third and 6% in the fourth. Is that just a decent general framework of how we're exiting 2023, that kind of 6% growth rate is the framework? Chris Snyder : Yes. And I'd say that at this point, and we missed the front end of your question, but I think I get the gist of what you're asking that, based upon the implied numbers in our guidance, order of magnitude, 7% growth rate would be the exit rate for the year, and there's a lot of assumptions that we need to work through to really understand what's the guidance is going to be for next year, what happens with supply chain, how the year unfolds. But I don't -- given where we sit today, if you had to pick a number, that would not be a bad starting point if you're looking to make an assumption for what 2024 looks like. It wouldn't be a bad starting point. But keep in mind, as we talked about, there are certain of our markets that we think are going to really inflect very positively next year, Aerospace is one. And so, early days, but if you had to put an anchor down today as a starting point, it wouldn't be a bad place to start. David Raso : Yes. I'm just trying to think through how much negativity you already have baked into vehicle to end the year; particularly the truck part would probably be viewed positively. So I guess within vehicle, do we have truck down by the fourth quarter. Aerospace is 150% the size of trucks. So if aero\u2019s up big in 2024, no problem if trucks down even significantly? Chris Snyder : We do. David Raso : I'm just trying to get a level. Chris Snyder : No, no. We do. David Raso : Be the vehicle down the truck now? Chris Snyder : We do have -- by the time we get to the fourth quarter of this year, we think North America Class 8 truck will be negative, and that is baked into our assumptions. David Raso : That\u2019s helpful. Thank you so much. Chris Snyder : Thank you, David. Operator : The next question is from Phil Buller from Berenberg. Please, go ahead. Phil Buller : Yes. Hi. Good morning. Thanks for fitting me in. A question for Craig in relation to the portfolio. Obviously, this has come along quite a lot on your watch, and you framed things with this, I guess, grow the head and shrink or fix the tail analogy, which is now align the group very nicely to these mega trends. But I'm wondering if there's much of a tail at this point? I don't get that sense from the prepared remarks, I get that there's always room for some incremental self-help here in there, and you touched on some of the efficiencies. But what, if anything, would you be deprioritizing from here in terms of organic or inorganic investment? And I guess I'm asking in relation to the Vehicle segment or trucks or potentially there's something else that you'd call out? Craig Arnold : Yeah. No, I'd say that I appreciate the acknowledgment. We have done a lot of work to position the portfolio to be where we are at this moment in time to really participate in the secular tailwinds, and that's certainly paying off. And to your point as well, we think we're never done with the portfolio. I mean, clearly, every year, we go through a fairly comprehensive process with our Board of Directors, looking at every business in the portfolio and understanding whether we like it today, we're going to like it five years from now. And so that is a very well in green process inside of our company as we look at the portfolio. And so we will continue to do that. We'll continue to evaluate every piece of the portfolio, not only the vehicle businesses. We're going to evaluate everything. Today, we like where we are. We think there's a real synergistic element of what we do today across Aerospace, across Vehicle as the whole world in the eMobility space specifically continues to electrify. We're getting real benefit today by -- as we launch this new eMobility segment by being a legacy provider to all of the automotive OEMs around the world. And so today, it works. We can't say that it's going to always work into the future. Every business has got to earn the right to stay a part of the portfolio. And that message is one that we deliver to everything, to every part of the company, not just to the vehicle team. Tom Okray : Yeah. A tangible example of that is if you go back to the prepared remarks and Electrical Global, we actually had a divestiture, which impacted the results in the quarter. It would be non-strategic by our GIS business, our old Cross fee line, and it's a great example of how we're fixing the tail. Craig is constantly challenging the organization for that. Phil Buller : That's great. Thank you. And just one very quick follow-up, if I may. In terms of the defense business, obviously, it's a good spot to be in terms of the growth outlook, but there's a lot of investors where defense exposure is a bit of a hurdle, particularly so for some European investors. So I'm wondering how you're thinking about defense M&A from here and whether or not that's a high or a low priority for you going forward? Thanks. Craig Arnold : Yeah, I'd say strategically, the way we think about the Aerospace business is you're either in or out. And if you're going to be in Aerospace, you need to be in defense. It's an important part of national security for sure. So there's a -- we understand the ESG-related concerns. And we understand that many investors have this 5% threshold. Today, defense is close to that number for Eaton. It's maybe 5% to 6% of our business overall. But I'd say that for us, we're really focusing on good businesses that make strategic sense for the company. And Aerospace is a platform within the company that we'd like to continue to grow. It's a good business. It's got all the right characteristics in businesses that we like. It's high margin. It's a highly differentiated based upon technology. You've got great position on platforms with a huge aftermarket that runs for decades. And so it has all the right set of characteristics for businesses that we like. So we will continue to prioritize first and foremost, Electrical. As we've said in the past, for a lot of reasons including these secular tailwinds. But Aerospace from a priority standpoint, is second only behind Electrical. Phil Buller : That\u2019s great. Thanks very much. Craig Arnold : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And at this time, there are no further questions in queue. Please continue. End of Q&A: Yan Jin : Okay, guys. Thanks. As always, Craig and I will be available for answering any follow-up questions. Have a good day, guys. Craig Arnold : Thank you. Tom Okray : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, your conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Yan Jin, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please, go ahead. Yan Jin : Good morning, guys. Thank you all for joining us for Eaton's second quarter 2023 earnings call. With me today are Craig Arnold, our Chairman and CEO; and Tom Okray, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our agenda today includes the opening remarks by Craig, then he will turn it over to Tom, who will highlight the company's performance in the second quarter. As we have done on our past calls, we'll be taking questions at the end of Craig\u2019s closing commentary. The press release and the presentation we'll go through today have been posted on our website. This presentation, including adjusted earnings per share, adjusted free cash flow and other non-GAAP measures. They are reconciled in the appendix. A webcast of this call is accessible on our website and will be available for replay. I would like to remind you that our comments today will include statements related to the expected future results of the company and are therefore forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our forecasted projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and the presentation. With that, I will turn it over to Craig. Craig Arnold : Thanks, Yan. Hey, today we're pleased to mark the end of the first quarter with one of our strongest performances ever, and a performance that strengthens our conviction about our long term growth prospects. Our teams continue to deliver on our commitment propelled by both strong markets and good execution. We'll begin with some of the highlights of the quarter on Page three. Well understood at this point, mega trends, reindustrialization, infrastructure spending are continuing to expand our markets, driving our revenue orders and backlogs. We posted another quarter of record financial performance with strong revenue, margins and earnings growth. And we executed well. In our first half performance along with our growing backlog is what allows us to once again raise our full year guidance. We're raising our 2023 guidance for organic growth margins and adjusted EPS, our EPS growth at the midpoint of our guidance is now up 16%. Tom will walk you through the details shortly. But from my perspective, the highlights of the quarter really are our growing backlogs up 22% on electrical and 26% in aerospace. With a book-to-bill ratio of 1.2 for both electrical and aerospace. We also generated strong operating and free cash flow, $1.2 billion and $900 million of more than 200% and 600% respectively. Free cash flow in the first half of the year is almost $800 million above prior year. So we're on track to deliver our full year guidance despite the higher growth and higher receivable balances. Overall, we're pleased with the results and well positioned for the second half. Moving to Slide four, we wanted to provide a simple framework that summarizes how we think about key growth drivers across our businesses. The important megatrends are listed here on the left at Eaton markets. And our segments are listed across the top of the page. At the intersection is where we see these trends having a material impact on our growth rate of our end markets. And without getting into a lot of the detail, the important message is that this long list of mega projects is impacting many of these end markets.  What we intend to do during the course of our quarterly earnings call today and really into the future is really to talk about these trends and how they impact our end markets. Today, we'll spend a few minutes on infrastructure spending and the Inflation Reduction Act, reindustrialization and an update on mega projects as well to look at Eaton's position in the utility and aerospace markets. We're highlighting the Inflation Reduction Act since its considerable upside to the initial estimates of future government spending. And on mega projects because they continue to grow dramatically. We picked the utility segment since it's quickly becoming one of our largest markets. It was approximately 15% of Electrical Americas sales last year, and is running well ahead of that rate this year. We received also some extensive questions from investors about our position in this market. Lastly, we'll highlight our aerospace business through the double-digit growth outlook, ramping defense and commercial platforms, including a substantial new win on the Bell V-280 Valor platform. Moving to Slide five, we're showing an updated look and expected spending tied to the Inflation Reduction Act. Most of the spending is focused on improving U.S. infrastructure. And as you can see, the estimates have increased significantly. At the time of passage, estimates on the cost impact, including credits and incentives was $271 billion. The legislation was recently rescored and government spending is now expected to be $663 billion, up nearly 2.5 times due to really what is an uncapped program. Importantly, these tax credits because they're uncapped, are expected to continue to grow. These dollars are naturally a strong catalyst for interest infrastructure spending, much of it targeted at industries where Eaton will be a significant benefactor. The implementation of the IRA is in the very early stages, and we think will provide significant tailwinds over the next 10 years. Very little of this impact is currently in our order book, and none of it has impacted revenue yet. On Page six, we have an updated chart showing the continued growth of mega projects in North America. We introduced this chart last quarter. And you will recall that we included announced projects that are greater than $1 billion in this category. The value of announced mega projects has increased by $116 billion or 20% between March and June. So the momentum continues and we'd expect the category to continue to grow at well above historical trends.  We've seen recent announcements for EV, semiconductor plants and new battery plants. So really across the board, and a few examples of some of the other major projects include $174 billion of downstream oil and gas or chemical, $33 billion of LNG export terminals, and $64 billion power generation and renewable energy projects.  Just another confirming data point, the Dodge Data for U.S. industrial projects continues to expand at a record pace. With 12-month manufacturing construction starts, up 72% on a 12-month basis -- on a rolling 12-month basis, and up 84% if you include LNG activity. And as a reminder, only 25% of these mega projects have started, so we're just at the beginning of this reindustrialization mega trend. Lastly, I remind you that we expect each of these mega projects to have between 3% and 5% electrical content.  Moving to Page seven, we highlight the utility segment of the Americas business. As we reported, in 2022 this market accounted for approximately 15% of Electrical Americas revenue and represents an even bigger percent to date. We've historically viewed the utility segment as a stable but slow growth business, generally in the low single digits. Over the next decade, utility distribution CapEx will account for 60% of the total utility CapEx globally, growing at a CAGR of 9%. Over the '22 to '25 period, we would expect an 11% CAGR.  The impact of sustainability initiatives across the globe have significantly boosted this number. This includes grid modernization, renewable energy, electrification of everything, enhance reliability, and safety needs, and government incentives are all contributing to this growth outlook. And while the electrical needs of the world continue to increase, our utility customers are finding it challenging to maintain an increasingly aging grid infrastructure.  As a point of reference, over 70% of U.S. transmission and distribution lines are over 25 years old. We're naturally making capital investments to address the growth here and have already committed to new capacity in our three major product families, transformers, voltage regulators, and line insulation products. It's worth highlighting that in this quarter, our Americas utility business backlog has increased 45%, organic revenues grew 30% in the Americas, and 20% in our global segment.  The graphics on Page eight highlight Eaton's unique position in the North America utility market where we're primarily focused on distribution. And given the significant changes taking place in this market, including the need to integrate renewables undergrounding for increased resiliency, the increased demand for grid services, we could not be more pleased with what we have to offer in this segment.  You can see from this slide that we have a broad position in the market. In fact, we have the industry's broadest portfolio of utility solutions. This includes grid planning software, design and engineering services, a complete offering of critical utility products, automation software, as well as extensive project management expertise. We also offer a broad range of digitally enabled hardware, grid edge controllers, for overhead underground and for substations.  Lastly, our Brightlayer solution for utility includes distribution planning software, distribution and substation automation, as well as smart grid communication centers and demand management. So overall, we're well positioned given our substantial portfolio of hardware, digitally enabled software and solutions. And in the quarter, we support a broad range of wins in the market, including hardware solutions for voltage regulators, power distribution, digital solutions for grid planning, in our software, we call SIM, in smart metering and also in utility services. Moving to Page nine, we'd like to highlight another well-known trend, the growth in aerospace markets. As you can see, we expect double-digit growth in each of the years between now and 2025, driven by the rebound in commercial OEM, commercial aftermarket and increase defense spending. The commercial market is expected to be very strong as Airbus and Boeing are both significantly increase in production volumes are expected to materially increase production on their most important platforms.  For example, Airbus is expected to increase production on the A320 from 45 to 50 per month currently to 75 per month by 2026. And Boeing is expected to increase production on the 737 from 31 per month currently to 50 per month in the '25 to '26 timeframe. And global passenger air travel is expected to return to 2019 levels by the end of this year, and grow at a 11% CAGR between now and 2025.  We also expect to see increased defense spending driven by various global conflicts, and governments allocating more dollars to our type of equipment to improve fleet readiness. Our aerospace business is especially well positioned on key defense platforms, both those targeted from our organization, and our new platforms that are being ramped up.  On Slide 10, in addition to the high volume single aisle growth that you hear so much about, the next group of key platforms driving a new growth today and into the future are listed here. These platforms are a good representation of important platforms ramping in the near term, over the next five years, and critical growth platforms for future decades. In all cases, we have more content than ever on each of these aircraft.  In the future category, we're showing the win with a bow on the V28 Valor program. The V28 is a replacement for the Blackhawk helicopter, and we have five times more content and are still bidding for more opportunities. We put the KC-46A, and the F-35 in the next category, aircraft that will be ramping in the near term, and will contribute materially to our revenue growth beginning next year. As you can see, our content per aircraft here is 2 to 3x legacy platform. And lastly, we're starting to see once again growth in the wide body market. The long haul market has been especially weak during the COVID and post COVID period, and is now beginning to pick up. The important message here is that these programs -- as these programs ramp up, we'd expect to grow faster than our end markets, given the increased content on each of these programs. So between market recovery and increase content per platform, our aerospace business is expected to see significant growth over the next five years or even longer.  Now, I'll turn it over to Tom, who'll take us through the financial slides. Tom Okray : Thanks, Craig. I'll start by providing a summary of our record Q2 results. Organic growth continues to be strong, up 13% for the quarter, the sixth quarter in a row with double-digit organic growth. Operating profit an all time quarterly record grew 21% and segment margins expanded 150 basis points to 21.6%, also an all-time quarterly record. We posted solid incremental margins of 33% up sequentially from 27% in Q1. Adjusted EPS increased by 18% over the prior year to $2.21 an all time quarterly record, and well above the high end of our guidance range. Looking at our first half results, we've had a very strong start to the year with organic growth up 14%, segment margins up 130 basis points, incremental margin up 30% and adjusted EPS growth of 17%.  Finally, last year, we explained that we were making a deliberate decision to invest in working capital to protect our customers and their orders. With supply chains improving, we are now able to better optimize working capital. The result together with strong earnings is a 600% increase in free cash flow in the first half of the year to 900 million. Moving on to the next chart, our Electrical Americas business delivered another very strong quarter. The megatrends are having a favorable impact on our U.S. business. We set all time quarterly records for sales, operating profit and segment margin. Beginning with the top line, organic sales growth of 19% remains very strong. Electrical Americas has generated double-digit organic growth for six consecutive quarters, with five of the quarters greater than 15%. On a two year stack organic growth is up 35%.  In the quarter, there was broad-based growth in nearly all end markets, with especially robust growth of 25% to 30% in data center, utility, industrial and commercial and institutional end markets. Operating margin of 26.4% was up 320 basis points versus prior year, benefiting from higher volumes and effective management of price cost. On a rolling 12-month basis, orders grew 7% with particular strength in data center and distributed IT, industrial and commercial and institutional end markets. Book-to-bill ratio remains above 1. We increased backlog by 30% year-over-year and sequentially 3%. It's worth noting that we secured orders for two large data centers worth nearly $300 million, including content to support these customers' AI growth projections. Finally, our major project negotiations pipeline in Q2 was up more than 17% versus prior year and nearly 9% sequentially from especially strong growth in data center, institutional, government, health care and transportation markets. On a two-year stack, our negotiation pipeline was up 65%. Overall, Electrical Americas continues to have a very strong year. On Page 13, you'll find the results of our Electrical Global segment, which posted all-time record sales of nearly $1.6 billion. Organic growth was up 6%, which was partially offset by a small divestiture. This represents a two-year stack of 18% organic growth. The growth was broad-based driven by strength in utility, data center and distributed IT and industrial end markets. Operating margin of 18.5% improved 20 basis points sequentially, but was down 40 basis points prior -- compared to prior year. The year-over-year decline was mostly driven by unfavorable product mix, partially offset by effective management of price cost and higher volumes. Orders were up 1% on a rolling 12-month basis with strength in utility and data center and IT end markets. Importantly, book-to-bill remained greater than 1. Before moving to our industrial businesses, I'd like to briefly recap the combined Electrical segment. For Q2, we posted organic growth of 14%, incremental margin of 38% and segment margin of 23.4%, which was up 200 basis points over prior year. On a rolling 12-month basis, our book-to-bill for our Electrical sector remains very strong at 1.2 and our record backlog grew 22%. We remain very confident in our positioning for continued growth with strong margins in our overall Electrical business. The next slide highlights our Aerospace segment. We posted an all-time quarterly sales record and a Q2 operating profit record. Organic growth was 14% for the quarter. We've posted double-digit growth in five of the last six quarters in this segment. Growth was driven by broad strength across all markets with particularly strong growth in commercial OEM and commercial aftermarket, which were up 21% and 30%, respectively. Operating margin was 22.5%, up 60 basis points over last year primarily driven by higher volumes. Growth in orders and backlog continue to be very strong. On a rolling 12-month basis, orders organically accelerated from up 21% in Q1 to up 26% in Q2 with especially strong growth in defense, OEM and aftermarket for both commercial and defense. Year-over-year backlog growth increased 26% in Q2, in line with growth in Q1. On a rolling 12-month basis, our book-to-bill for Aerospace remains very strong at 1.2 times. Moving on to our Vehicle segment on Page 15. In Q2, organic growth was up 6%. We saw particularly strong growth in North America light vehicle, APAC and EMEA markets, all up double digits. Operating margins came in at 15.3%. During the quarter, we delivered improvements in our manufacturing facilities, which contributed to sequential margin improvement of 80 basis points. We continue to win new business tied to clean technology solutions, including multiple clean commercial valve actuation programs. Additionally, we've won over $60 million per year in program length extensions and volume increases with multiple OEMs. On Page 16, we show results for our eMobility business. We generated another quarter of strong growth. Organic revenue was up 18%. Margin improved 100 basis points versus prior year, mostly driven by higher volumes. Overall, we remain very encouraged by the growth prospects of the eMobility segment. So far in 2023, we have won new programs with more than $450 million of mature year revenues, positioning us very well to exceed our 2025 target of $1.2 billion of revenue. Through these wins, we continue to find opportunities to leverage expertise across all segments. For example, we've reached an agreement with a major OEM to supply power electronics control unit for an electrically heated catalyst to meet emissions regulations. This win demonstrates Eaton's ability to leverage capabilities across our entire portfolio, including core technology in both electrical and industrial businesses, such as brake torque, power protection and bus man fuses. We've also capitalized on our extensive vehicle expertise and added content in connectors from our Royal Power acquisition. Moving to Page 17. We show our Electrical and Aerospace backlog updated through Q2. As you can see, we continue to build backlog with Electrical stepping up to $9.1 billion, a sequential increase of 2%. Electrical backlog is up about 110% since Q2 of 2021 and over 200% higher than Q2 2020.  Aerospace backlog is holding steady at $3 billion. This is a 30% increase since Q2 2021 and over 100% higher than Q2 of 2020. On a rolling 12-month basis, book-to-bill was 1.2 for both Electrical and Aerospace with absolute orders remaining at high levels and record backlogs, our book-to-bill over 1 times is yet again a key metric that gives us confidence in our outlook into the quarters to come. With all the tailwinds in our end markets, we think it is likely that we will have high levels of backlog going forward, which enhances our visibility over the planning horizon. On the next page, we show our fiscal year organic growth and operating margin guidance. We are raising our organic growth guidance for 2023 in both Electrical Americas and for the total company. We now expect organic growth in Electrical Americas of 14% to 16%, up 300 basis points from our prior 11% to 13% guidance. This represents a 600 basis point improvement from our starting 2023 guidance for the business. In total, we're raising our 2023 organic growth outlook to a midpoint of 11%, up from a 10% midpoint in our prior guidance. Our strong end market growth forecast, expanding negotiations pipeline and building backlog provide tremendous visibility and confidence in this 2023 outlook. For segment margins, we are increasing our total Eaton margin guidance range by 40 basis points from a prior range of 20.7% to 21.1% to a new range of 21.1% to 21.5%. This is a result of an improved outlook in Electrical Americas where we increased the range by 80 basis points on strong demand and continued strong operational execution. The increased outlook now represents a 110 basis point increase from the midpoint of our 2022 all-time record margins. In summary, at the halfway mark, we remain well positioned to deliver another very strong year of financial performance. On the next page, we have additional guidance metrics for 2023 and Q3. Following our strong first half performance and improved organic growth expectations for the year, we're raising our full year EPS range to $8.65 and to $8.85. At the midpoint, the $8.75, we have raised guidance by $0.35. This represents 16% growth in adjusted EPS in 2023 over prior year. We now expect currency translation to be roughly neutral and the remainder of our full year guidance remains unchanged. For Q3, we're guiding organic growth of 9% to 11%. Segment margins of between 22% and 22.4% representing a 100 basis point improvement at the midpoint versus prior year, and adjusted EPS in the range of $2.27 to $2.35, a 15% increase versus prior year at the midpoint. Now I'll hand it back to Craig to wrap up the presentation. Craig Arnold : Thanks, Tom. Now turning to Page 20. As a reminder, last quarter, we raised our growth assumption for the utility market to strong double-digit growth, and we increased our residential market outlook to flat from declining. We're now increasing our growth assumption for the commercial institutional and for data center markets to strong double-digit growth. In addition to stronger than anticipated demand for new projects, existing buildings are being retrofitted with more electrical infrastructure as EVs continue to increase their penetration in the market. And data center demand continues to remain at very high levels and we now expect to see double-digit growth in this market as well. The balance of our end markets continue to perform well and are tracking along our prior projections. So while the macroeconomic outlook remains choppy, we continue to expect growth in almost all of our markets. I'll close with a summary on Page 21. As you can tell, we're feeling good about how our markets are performing this year, and we think that will be strong for many more years to come. In fact, the mega trends that we've discussed for some time now are expected to be even more impactful than we originally anticipated. Our markets are strong, but we also had solid execution in the quarter and delivered another strong set of results that included a number of financial records. And as we look to the back half of the year and into 2024, our increasing backlog provides great visibility on our growth outlook. As noted, we raised our guidance for growth and EPS for the second time, and our largest business, Electrical Americas continues to post new records. With that, we'll open it up for questions you may have. Yan Jin : Thanks, Craig. For the Q&A today, please limit your opportunity to just one question and one follow-up. Thanks everyone for your cooperation. With that, I will turn it over to the operator to give you guys the instructions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Joe Ritchie : Thanks. Good morning. And congrats, everyone. So look, my first question, you guys called out a few of those large data center wins that you booked into orders this quarter. I'm just curious, Craig, maybe just kind of help conceptualize what that means from like content per data center and how that's going to -- how that's shifting for your business now that there's a lot of discussion around generative AI and what that means for you guys? Craig Arnold : I appreciate the question, Joe. And I know there's been a lot of discussion around AI and how it's going to impact the world, not only kind of data centers. But I would tell you that the data center market, as we've talked about on these calls for some time now, has been strong and it's been strong for multiple years. On AI side, that market has been growing at double digit. And I'd tell you that the big wins that we booked during the quarter, I'd say most of that really has nothing to do with the AI impact yet. A lot of that is in the future. A lot of the major data center players are still trying to sort out the way they're going to configure their data centers, to deal with this AI environment and the increased energy intensity. So I'd say, for us, it was just another very strong quarter of data center wins that really has not seen the impact yet of this whole emergence of generative AI. So it's -- we're feeling great about that market and we think generative AI and its downstream implications are just going to keep that market strong for a much longer period of time, and we're well positioned there. Joe Ritchie : That's great to hear. And maybe just a broader question around your backlog and the type of visibility that it's providing for you. I think I asked you last year whether -- why wouldn't you be able to grow double digits this year. And now it looks like you're very well on track to do so. Trying to really kind of think through the implications of your backlog today and what that means for 2024 and beyond. So any comments around that would be helpful. Craig Arnold : Yes. I mean as you can imagine, we're not in a position to provide guidance at this point for 2024, given the fact that it's still early in the year, and we'll probably have an opportunity to do that towards the end of the year as we would normally do so. But to your point, I mean, the backlog continues to grow.  And the backlog, as you saw in these reports, is up multiples of where we've been historically, which gives us much better visibility, better visibly than we've ever had into the outlook for the upcoming 12 to 18 months. And so we're feeling very good about what 2024 is going to look like. It will be another strong growth year for the company, and we'll certainly provide some guidance on what the year looks like as a part of our normal process and timing for giving the outlook. But the backlog certainly gives us a lot of courage with respect to what we think the year is going to look like, given that the growth and where it is relative to where it has been historically. Tom Okray : Maybe I can just piggy back on to that a little bit. We've seen a lot of focus on order intake and certainly, that's a very important metric to look at. But it's important that you look at it in the context of this historically high backlog that we have together with the protracted delivery times and lead times that we have. So as Craig alluded to, we're nearly 3 times our historical backlog coverage. And we went through modeling scenarios where you look at various order intake declines and combine that with robust organic growth, we're confident that we will not hit our historical backlog coverage timing until two to three years out. So we're very bullish on the transparency that the backlog gives us, and it really does mute the order intake and order to decline a little bit. Joe Ritchie : Super helpful. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is Josh Pokrzywinski from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Josh Pokrzywinski : Hey, good morning guys. So I feel like you guys have done a really great job of kind of scoring some of the background announcements, whether it's the mega projects or, I guess, Slide five, with some of the stuff from IRA. Maybe just give us an update on where we are in looking through that. I would imagine the vast majority of that is not really in the order book. You talked about really high customer interaction or engagement or kind of the front log, I forget what the exact term was. But where are we through kind of those orders or initial discussions yet? Craig Arnold : No, I appreciate the commentary, Josh, and this is, I think, really an important message with respect to some of these big government stimulus spending or whether it's the government stimulus spending and its impact or the mega projects that we're talking about. We do think one of the key messages that we think is important to kind of get to your head around is the fact that most of this impact has not showed up at this point in our order book, and it certainly has not shown up in our revenues. We did talk about on some of the infrastructure projects, some $2 billion of projects that we have visibility to, we've won visibility. $1 billion of that have been out to quote, we won about half of that. But that is a really small piece of the total dollars that will ultimately be spent tied to some of these infrastructure and other mega projects that we talked about. And so it is very early innings for us with respect to the forward-looking programs that we've shared with you on these calls, and it's what gives us confidence that what we're dealing with here is a long-term structural shift in our business with respect to the underlying growth rates. And we'll certainly continue to report out as we learn more, and we'll do this on a quarterly basis. But really encouraged by the fact that most of the goodness that we're talking about is still a future. Josh Pokrzywinski : Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe just a quick follow-up, respecting that orders and backlog have kind of had their own cadence right now with what you guys are going through and just explained. Are the shorter cycle parts of Electrical seeing kind of that lead time normalization show up in orders? I think some of your peers have seen that. Obviously, you guys are longer cycle and things like switchgear maybe don't fall into it. But any part of that where you're seeing either like a destock or lead time normalization show up? Craig Arnold : Yes. We're certainly not seeing any destocking across the business, but in fact, to your point, around the short-cycle businesses, whether that's resi or what's happening in the OEM channel or distributed IT, those would be three shorter cycle markets that we clearly have seen a slowdown in orders overall and lead times as a result of that have come in quite nicely in those three end markets, obviously, being more than offset by strength in the other much larger segments that we serve. But in those three short-cycle pieces of the business, we have clearly seen lead times come in, we've seen orders moderate in those three end markets. Josh Pokrzywinski : Helpful colors always. Thanks a lot guys. Operator : The next question is from the line of Chris Snyder from UBS. Please go ahead. Chris Snyder : Thank you. And I want to follow up on Josh's question, specifically around the Inflation Reduction Act. It sounds like not much orders yet on the back of the IRA. Is it reasonable to think that orders there could start coming through in 2024? And when we look across all the company's various business lines, which ones do you think will benefit most from the IRA specifically? Thank you. Craig Arnold : Yes, I do think in terms of the timing, for sure, as we think about 2024, we would expect to start to see those projects be clarified negotiations and some orders begin to show up in 2024, maybe some early shipments at the best case at the end of the year but as you know, these projects tend to be much longer term. And a lot of these dollars are going to support mega projects and mega projects, just by definition, tend to be much longer cycle than the typical stock and flow business that we have. And so we would expect to start to see that begin to show up next year. Now your point on which companies would benefit the most, I'm not sure -- I mean clearly... Chris Snyder : Sorry, which verticals within -- so there's verticals within the company. I apologize. Craig Arnold : I'm sorry? Chris Snyder : Sorry, which vertical within the company? Craig Arnold : Yes. I'd say clearly, as we think about the various verticals and we kind of laid that out in our presentation on Slide four, and this was -- appreciate your commentary because what we've really tried to do on Slide four in our PowerPoint is to give you a sense for the key mega trends and how they impact the various verticals that we participate in. So if you look at infrastructure spending, the great news for us is that it is very broad, plays across the board and impacts most of our segments but I'd say it certainly will show up most materially, I'd say, in the Industrial segment. If you think about what's going on today in the investments in new EV factories and battery factories, what's going on in the chemical space, a lot of it will show up in what we call industrial facilities. But it really does cut across pretty broadly in most of the end markets in which we participate. Chris Snyder : No, absolutely. I very much appreciate that. Then maybe following up on that industrial comment. Everyone, I think, has kind of seen the massive manufacturing starts that's now leading to higher activity put in place. How should we think about the lag in which that flows to your business from the start to when it starts generating revenue for Eaton? You guys said these are very long cycle projects. Just wondering kind of how long kind of single facility kind of generate revenue for you? Thank you. Craig Arnold : Yes. No, I appreciate that question. As you can imagine, as we've seen the significant transition to these mega projects, we spent a fair amount of time internally trying to answer the same question. From an announcement to a negotiation, negotiation to an order and order to a shipment. And it varies widely depending upon the type of project you're referring to. And I'd say it could be as short as six months, it could be as long as three years. And when you think about a lot of these mega projects, they do tend to be longer in nature. So they would tend to be on the longer end of that cycle just by virtue of the size of these projects. Tom Okray : And I think the exciting thing about it, as we said in the prepared remarks, we see each quarter like $100 billion coming in, and then it is going to give us a nice cadence going forward for quite some time. And just to come back to the Inflation Reduction Act, I mean, we put that particular act in for illustrative purposes, but just to draw your attention, we've also got the Infrastructure Act, the CHIPS Act and in Europe, the EU recovery plan. So when you put all this together, there's just a ton of government stimulus supporting key parts of our business. Chris Snyder : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Nicole DeBlase from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Nicole DeBlase : Yes, thanks. Good morning, guys. Maybe just on free cash flow. I noticed you guys raised the EPS guidance by a pretty considerable amount but free cash flow remain consistent. Can you just talk about the drivers of that? And I'm sure part of that has to do with your working capital plans for the second half? Thanks. Tom Okray : Yes. That's a great question, Nicole. We were up almost $800 million. The majority of that around, let's call it, $550 million was with working capital optimization and $250 million was from earnings. We debated, do we take up the guidance on free cash flow. And we thought because it kind of fits within the range right now, we'd give it another quarter. We're happy the way it's going. Obviously, up 600% is something to be happy about. We've improved cash conversion cycle by nine days. That said, we still have a lot of work to do, and we want to get our free cash flow margin up even higher. Craig Arnold : And I'll just add, as we grow as well, we're obviously putting more cash into receivable. And so it's -- we're all having to fund as well the increased working capital as a result of the higher growth. Nicole DeBlase : Got it. Makes sense. And then on the non-resi vertical, obviously, like ongoing questions about the strength there. Are there any patches within the whole non-resi complex? Were you guys are seeing any signs of slowing activity? Craig Arnold : Yes. No, I appreciate the question. And once again, if you just think about it in the context of the end market segments that we've laid out on Slide four, I mean, most of what we do is non-resi. And in the context of your question specifically, as we mentioned, we have seen a slowdown in what we call distributed IT. And we have seen a little bit of a slowdown in what we call the MOEM segment of the market as well. Fortunately, for us, those are -- those tend to be smaller segments of the market and the growth in the other verticals is clearly more than offsetting that weakness. We have seen a little bit of a slowdown in those other two verticals as well. Tom Okray : That said, if you look at the first half of the year organic growth, I mean, we're up in every single end markets. Some of them obviously significant more than others. Craig Arnold : And including resi, which we took our numbers. If you recall from the prior quarter in the call, we actually took our outlook for the year up in resi, where we originally thought that, that market would have been down, and we took the market up to the point where resi is doing much better than, quite frankly, we anticipated as we began the year. Tom Okray : Absolutely. And MOEM is also up first half of the year. Nicole DeBlase : Excellent. Thanks guys, I\u2019ll pass it on. Operator : The next question is from David Raso from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. David Raso : Hi, thank you very much. I apologize if I missed this earlier. The Electrical Americas, the organic growth, right? The first quarter '22, '19, back half of the year, we're looking for about 10.5 as per the guide. What percent of that growth has been pricing, like, say, or even the assumption for the second half, whatever you're willing to discuss? And then just a sense of the pricing that's in the backlog? I'm just trying to get a sense of, obviously, the backlog is a little bit more the megatrend than the smaller, shorter cycle projects and businesses. So I'm just trying to get a sense of that pricing dynamic relative to the overall organic sales growth? Craig Arnold : Yes, I appreciate the question, Dave. And I'd say that one of the reasons why we are forecasting a slowdown in growth between the first half and the second half is really the strong comparable. If you look at the back half of the year, we were up some 19% and a lot of that, quite frankly, was price, and we're getting a lot less contributions for price in the back half of this year. When you take a look at it actually on a two-year stack, the growth essentially is essentially the same. It's about 30% versus 2021, essentially normalizing for the really strong back half, a lot of which was priced. In terms of price in the backlog, I would say that as you will likely recall, one of the things that we did was we actually repriced our backlog and much of it. And so if you think about the underlying performance today, what you're seeing in the Electrical Americas business, and we're shipping a lot of that out of backlog because the backlog is so long is it's essentially. We don't expect backlog to have a material impact on the underlying performance of the business as we ship it. David Raso : I guess trying to maybe get a little more detail on that. The back half of the year or if you want to even discuss 2Q, what are volumes in the guide for the back half of the year? And then just trying to think about essentially supply chains improving. Obviously, some of these demand drivers shouldn't fade away that quickly versus some of the shorter cycle businesses that are turning down. I'm just trying to balance volume and price exiting the year. Craig Arnold : Sure. Sure. I know you're really trying to get at the split between price and volume that we've told you before on these calls, we're not going to provide it. And so what I would just tell you is that we are getting much greater contributions from volume than we are from price in the second half of the year. David Raso : I appreciate. Thank you so much. Craig Arnold : Thank you, Dave. Appreciate. Tom Okray : Yes. I mean keep in the context of the prepared remarks, we've raised organic growth in Electrical Americas 600 basis points since the original guide. And our fiscal year guide is 15%, which is fairly sporty. Obviously, we can all do the math on the implied for the back half. But I think overall, when you step back and look at it, pretty aggressive. Craig Arnold : And volumes are growing. I love to think we could get 15% price, but we can't. Operator : The next question is from Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Please go ahead. Julian Mitchell : Thanks. Good morning. I just wanted to start with the Electrical Global business. You mentioned some of the very strong markets and maybe some of those that are a little bit weaker. How long are you expecting that weakness to last? And when we look at the profitability in Electrical Global, you've got that nice sort of margin turnaround in the back half which I think is driving an acceleration in year-on-year profit growth to sort of close to double-digit levels in the second half. Maybe just help us understand the main drivers of that pickup? Craig Arnold : I appreciate the question, Julian. And I would say that on a relative basis, certainly, Electrical Global is not growing at the same rate as we're growing in the Americas. But I wouldn't call those markets weak. I would still say that those markets are seeing pretty attractive growth. With respect to the first half versus the second half, as we mentioned to you in some of the commentary and Tom, we did have a particular mix challenge in our Electrical Europe business in Q2. And so those margins were held back due to some very specific mix-related issues in that business. And based upon the visibility that we have into the second half, we do believe that they do not repeat, and the business gets back to a more normal level of profitability in the second half of the year. We have pretty high confidence that that's going to take place. Tom Okray : Yes. A couple of other areas that we're counting on in addition to mix in the back half is higher volume and being better in terms of our productivity in terms of manufacturing. Julian Mitchell : That's really helpful. Thank you. And then I'm not sure you're sort of hazard a guess at this, but I just thought I'd check because it was in focus at one of your electrical peers this morning. But when you think about your backlog to revenue coverage, total company, it's gone from sort of 20% towards 50-plus percent in the last three years at Eaton. Some of your peers who also have good sort of mega trend exposure, they're talking about that backlog normalizing maybe to 30% of sales. I'm not asking you to put a fine point on your view of that for Eaton but just a sense of the pace at which that backlog to sales may normalize? Because I guess the experience of a lot of other companies is once the backlog peaks, it doesn't seem to stay there very long, it sort of starts to move down as customers normalize lead times. Craig Arnold : I appreciate the question, Julian. And in many ways, we're talking about the unknowable, right, given in terms of the uncertainty around what the future looks like. I would say though, if you think about Eaton's business, and that's why we thought it was so important you go back to Slide four in our PowerPoint presentation to talk about the breadth of our portfolio and how it's impacted by these various megatrends.  And I would tell you that we aren't the same as other electrical companies, and some of them are exposed to some but not others. And I would just say what makes Eaton unique here is really the breadth of our portfolio and the end markets that we serve and how each of these markets are benefiting from these megatrends. And so I'm not sure what particular electrical period you're referring to, but I would say that we would likely have much broader exposure to a number of these trends than other electrical companies. Tom Okray : Yes. And I mean, just to add to that, I think we had it included in the prepared remarks, but I think it bears repeating. Our backlog in the quarter is up 220% since the end of '19. And with all the mega projects, the stimulus spends, the secular trends that Craig just mentioned, we don't have a lot of discussion about the backlog going down. Craig Arnold : And if you think -- I mean are there certain electrical companies, for example, who would play heavily inside of factories who maybe don't play on the infrastructure side. We are a massive infrastructure player. And so I just want to just point that out in terms of as you think about Eaton versus other companies, you can't really necessarily draw a straight-line correlation between us and them. We obviously have seen our peers announced and there's a very difference in growth in a number of the peers this quarter too, a function of the fact that we play in very different end markets than some of our other electrical peers. Tom Okray : We also have that nice mix of going through the channel as well as these big mega projects with direct to the customer. So we've got this nice balance as well in that area. Craig Arnold : And in the point that Tom is picking up on that, I think is really an important one is this notion around if you take a look at what's happening with the number of our distributors, oftentimes, you want to draw a straight line between what you're seeing in the distribution channel to what we're experiencing in our own business. And to Tom's point, these big mega projects that we're talking about, a lot of the big infrastructure-related investments, these are direct projects that are not flowing through distribution. So you also will see perhaps a decoupling between how we could perform versus some of the electrical distributors as well. Julian Mitchell : That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from the line of Steve Volkmann from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Steve Volkmann : Great. Thanks for fitting me in. I wanted to actually switch to Aerospace, if I could. I appreciate your comments there. I know, right? I appreciate your comments there on sort of the medium-term outlook, looks very robust. I'm curious how you think the real ramp that you outlined in OE will impact margin mix over the next sort of three to five years? Craig Arnold : I appreciate the question and what you're kind of poking at a little bit understandably is the fact that OE margins tend to be well below aftermarket margins. But the good news here is we're finding that both OE and aftermarket, which is really tied to revenue passenger kilometers or revenue passenger miles, both of those pieces of the business are essentially ramping.  And if you heard what we reported in our numbers, we actually saw even more growth in aftermarket in the quarter than we did on the OE side. And so we don't anticipate a negative mix impact from this ramp on the OE side as we look out to the forecast for the next number of years. But to your point, it is certainly something to watch if you ever get in many way, inverted there and OE is growing in aftermarket, it isn't, it would certainly have a negative impact on margins, but that's not our anticipation. Tom Okray : Yes. And just to remind you, with a couple of numbers here, trailing 12 months or rolling 12 months is in the aftermarket is 25%, and that's really 25% on both defense and commercial. Craig Arnold : And OE and aftermarket, which is really the important point. Steve Volkmann : Great. That's super helpful. And then just one quick longer-term question, Craig. I mean, given all these trends across all your businesses, we're obviously going to have a period of very strong growth here. And I just don't think we've compounded at these types of levels over multiple years in the past. So how do you think about capacity here because the rates of growth seem like they're really kind of inflecting for a longer term? Craig Arnold : No. First of all, you're absolutely right. This is a very different electrical industry, a very different Eaton than the one that perhaps your grandfather and grandmother knew. And so as a result of that, we are making fairly sizable investments in capital equipment. We talked about it in the last earnings call, some of the big investments that we're making in the utility space. And I mentioned in my outfield commentary, we made investments in transformer capacity, both at regulators and line insulation products. These are essentially capital investments that are ongoing right now. We've made some fairly sizable investments in our circuit breaker capacity over the last couple of years. And so we are having to invest more in capital equipment. But I would say even in the big scheme of things, the level of investment is maybe going to tick up 0.5% more of sales, maybe another percent of sales, but very well manageable in the context of the overall growth of the company. Tom Okray : Yes. The important thing is the focus is really there. We're just recently with our Board and our strategy session. And a big part of that was the capacity related to meeting this hyper growth. So we're very hungry. There's a lot of food on the table. We're very hungry. Steve Volkmann : Great. Well, that I\u2019ll let you go after lunch. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Nigel Coe : Thanks. Good afternoon. Lunch sounds good to me. So we've cut a lot of gram. So back to Electrical. You mentioned, I think, Craig, retrofit activity, which I think was in relation to C&I end markets in particular. And I know you talked about this in the past, increasing load content, and I think it was in relation to charging specifically. But maybe just talk about what activity you're seeing within retrofits and how you think that develops over the next couple of years? Craig Arnold : Yes. No, certainly appreciate the question. And we do -- if you think about today, why we are feeling incrementally more positive around what's happening today in commercial and institutional. And a bit of this is simply what we're all experiencing around the growth in electrification, the growth in EV charging infrastructure and the investments that are being put in to support the growth and the demand for electricity on the grid.  And so in terms of quantifying the impact of that versus the impact of the new build, like I say, we're not -- we're probably today not smart enough to do that with the needed degree of precision. I can tell you that it is an important piece of what we're seeing in terms of growth, it will contribute to growth. How do you quantify the impact of retrofits versus the new build stuff? We're trying to work through some of those questions and answers. But things are moving so quickly right now that, quite frankly, we haven't had a chance to really put pen to paper and really try to figure it out.  But we are going to see, to your point, we're going to see it in both new buildings and we're going to see a lot of retrofits and modifications, whether it's in a home to put an electrical infrastructure in residential and whether it's in commercial buildings or offices to support EV charging, to support the addition of solar, the additions of battery storage, all of these investments that are being made to improve your electrical capacity resiliency, a lot of that will go into existing buildings. But be a little smarter on this topic and get you a little better answer than that. But certainly an important one for us, but one we're still trying to quantify. Nigel Coe : No, I agree. And then on data centers, I just want to take the other side of the -- of sort of the -- are you seeing any signs of weakness? Doesn't look like it, but are there any signs of weakness out there? I'm thinking maybe China perhaps might be a bit softer. And then when you think about generative AI and GPU racks, does this increase the revenue per megawatts? Or does this just increase the total megawatts in the market? Any thoughts there would be helpful. Craig Arnold : Yes. I mean, to your first question, are we seeing any signs of weakness, I would say, not really. I mean, whether geographically or whether it's not just either the hyperscalers, we're seeing at colo, we're seeing on-prem. We're seeing it around the world. Globally, we're seeing strength in the data center market. And then to the point around -- once again, you get back to this important question around AI's impact on data centers and the way they're going to be configured. Certainly, we understand that they're going to need more power. The power density, these racks is going to go up. But we still don't know. I think it's early days, and it's one that we know we owe you an answer. We know we owe ourselves an answer on that one as well as we continue to talk to some of the big data center providers around how they're going to be configuring these data centers and how they're going to change. But to say, we're still in the early innings, and we don't yet have all the answers to how they're going to be reconfigured. Tom Okray : Yes. And just a little bit more on Craig's point in your question on slowing. Each part of the world for the first half of the year, data centers, including hyperscale, grew double digit. It's just a matter of whether it grew mid-double digits or in the 20s or in the 30s. We're seeing robust growth across the board. Nigel Coe : Okay, that\u2019s great detail. Thanks a lot. Operator : And the next question is from Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Steve Tusa : Thanks for fitting me in. When you said greater contributions from volume and price in the second half of the year, what exactly do you mean by that? Do you mean that you just expect the skew to be more towards volume in the second half versus the first half? Or maybe just a little bit more color on what you meant by that? Craig Arnold : Yes, that's primarily what we're referring to, Steve, because if you think about most of the big price increases that we put through in our business, most of those showed up in the second half of last year. We got some modest price increases this year, but most of the big price increases that we got in the second half of last year. So they're really baked into the comparable for 2020, 2022, and we're anniversarying those big increases right now. And so just on the relative contribution to growth, on a relative basis, we're going to giving it more from volume than we offer price in the second half of the year. Steve Tusa : Okay. That's helpful. And then just on the Electrical Americas business. I mean, should we think about this margin you're doing, especially here in the second quarter here? I mean is that like -- I know you have it going down sequentially in the second half, I guess, a little bit. Is that the jumping off point for next year? How sustainable is that? And any moving parts there that you want to call out as we tinker with our models for next year? Craig Arnold : Yes, I'd say that our team continues to execute well. We certainly had a little bit of perhaps favorable mix in Q2, and maybe that's what you're seeing in terms of the relative change between Q2 and in the back half of the year. But there's nothing -- there's no unusual in those numbers. That's just straight operating performance execution by our team. And yes, the simple answer is, yes, that should be the jumping off point as we think about what this business should look like into 2024 and beyond. And obviously, we're going to have volume growth and so the business is performing well, and we'd expect it to continue to perform well. Tom Okray : Yes. And Steve, I would just add, we know what the implied say for the segment margins, we're hoping we do better than the implied. Steve Tusa : Right. But is that the jumping off point for next year? Like is that a sustainable number that you can improve on next year? Tom Okray : Yes. Steve Tusa : Okay. Straightforward. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Deane Dray from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Deane Dray : Thank you. Good day, everyone. Covered a lot of ground, but I did hear a couple of references to unknowables and a choppy macro. So it kind of begs the question about the initial assumption for this year so long ago, it seems for a mild recession. Is any clarity in terms of your assumption there? Or is it everything seems to be skewing much higher? Craig Arnold : Yes. No. I mean I think to your point, Deane, we, like so many others had anticipated a mild recession this year and our thinking around recession continues to be pushed out as it does for, I think, most of the economists in the world. And so at this juncture, I mean, we're feeling pretty good about the year. It's one of the reasons why we're taking up our guidance.  And I think the bigger message becomes in the event of a mild recession, very much consistent with what we said originally, even in the event of a mild recession, given the mega trends and the stimulus spending and the strength of our end markets, we don't believe it's going to have a material impact at all on Eaton's growth. That's what we said at the beginning of the year, and that's what we continue to believe. Tom Okray : Yes. And Deane, I'll take you back to an earlier response. We've modeled even with downturns in order intake, if you use that for a proxy in terms of a mild recession, we are very confident that we can power through that given our backlog in the megatrend. Deane Dray : Yes. That seems clear. And then just a very quick follow-up on Steve Volkmann's question about capacity. When we were all together in New York a while back, we talked about shortages of smart switch gear and transformers. Is that in any way holding back the utility demand at least that I'm not sure you'll be able to supply? And how does that change? Craig Arnold : Yes. No, I'd say as an industry, things are better. And I'd say we are -- the industry and some of the supply chain choke points are materially better today than they were, let's say, this time last year but we're clearly not out of the woods. And there are certainly certain markets and verticals that are still very much challenged with respect to lead times and the utility market is one of those. As we mentioned, on these calls before that, probably the longest lead time device we probably have in the company is a transformer that goes into the utility segment. And so very much a function of which end market and which product you're talking about. In general, things are getting better, but there's lead times are still extended. We're still not back to, let's call it, the pre-2019 levels of lead times. We Think our lead times are competitive with our peers in the marketplace and -- but yet, we're still not back to where we were in 2019, and we still are extended in certain product lines. Deane Dray : Thank you. Operator : And our next question is from Brett Linzey from Mizuho. Please go ahead. Brett Linzey : Good afternoon. I just wanted to follow up on that utility comment there. You gave the growth framework to '25. I think you said 11% growth. How should we think about Eaton's relative growth in the context of wallet share per opportunity or any share shifts from some of these capacity additions? Craig Arnold : Yes. I mean I'd say, Eaton's relative performance, I think with respect to our peers, as we talked about before, and it's one of the reasons why we included that chart is that all of our peers aren't the same. We play very broadly across the utility end segment. As I said in my commentary, we think we are the broadest player. We have a broader portfolio of solutions in the utility market than any of our competitors. And so we think we are very well positioned to grow at market, to grow and perhaps grow faster than the market. We are today as our -- most of our peers capacity constrained. And so I do think that the real limiter on growth in terms of the utility market these days is really going to be our ability to add capacity to deal with the growth that we're seeing. And that is the one segment where lead times are still quite extended. And until we get this new capacity online, it's going to be very difficult for us to grow at a much faster rate than the overall market. Brett Linzey : Okay. Great. And then just one follow-up, and I apologize if I missed it, but on the project funnel, you guys have been giving that rate of growth year-over-year and sequentially. Just curious how that fared in the quarter. Tom Okray : Yes. The negotiated, the major projects. Yes, it was up 17% year-over-year and 65% on a two-year stack. Brett Linzey : Great. Thanks a lot. Best of luck. Operator : The next question is from Joe O'Dea from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Joe O'Dea : Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I'll ask them both together because they're kind of related. One is lead time related, one is backlog. But any additional color if you think about some of the biggest kind of revenue product categories, just some perspective on where lead times are, where they were at their worst, kind of what you need to get back to for normalization and then related to that, I think all the tailwinds that you're discussing on sort of the mega project support out there, the stimulus support out there. I think, Tom, your comment was it might take two to three years for backlog to get back to normal. But I guess even as these lead times correct, it's back to normal, really the expectation or you think it's going to take quite some time before we really start to see any kind of notable step down in these levels? Craig Arnold : Yes. And I'd say maybe just kind of addressing kind of the first part of your question, which is kind of on lead times and as I mentioned on the prior question, lead times are, in fact, still extended. They've improved somewhat, certainly more so in some of the shorter-cycle businesses. We talked about resi, OEM, distributed IT. For the big project-related stuff, a lot of those lead times today are still fairly well extended. And for utility markets, they probably haven't improved much at all. So it really does vary widely depending upon which vertical you're referring to. And it once again, I said we are sold out.  We don't have a lot of excess capacity today to really deal with what has clearly been a much faster acceleration in growth than what we originated in some of these big industrial centered kind of product lines and businesses. And until capacity comes online, we would not anticipate that these lead times get materially better. And the same thing I would say would be true backlog, obviously, to your point, very much interrelated until you can release reduce lead times, barring a significant slowdown in the markets, which we don't anticipate, you're really not going to deal with reducing your backlogs either. And so we do think that under a normal planning horizon, the way we're thinking about it, backlog stay elevated for some period of time. I think what Tom was trying to do was simply to try to provide a little comfort around that even if markets slow down, we should continue to be able to post very attractive revenue growth because we can simply eat backlog. Tom Okray : That's right. The two to three years that I quoted is in a turndown situation and as arguably be conservative. Joe O'Dea: Got it. Makes sense. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. And at this time, there are no further questions in queue. Please continue. Yan Jin : Thanks, guys. As always, Chip and I will be available to address any of your guys' follow-up questions. Thanks for joining us today. Have a great day. Operator : Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Event Conferencing. You may now disconnect.",

I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Yan Jin, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Yan Jin : Good morning. Thank you all for joining us for Eaton\u2019s third quarter 2023 earnings call. With me today are Craig Arnold, our Chairman and CEO; and Tom Okray, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our agenda today includes the opening remarks by Craig, then he will turn it over to Tom, who will highlight the company\u2019s performance in the third quarter. As we have done in our past calls, we will be taking questions at the end of Craig\u2019s closing commentary. The press release and the presentation we\u2019ll go through today have been posted on our website. This presentation, including adjusted earnings per share, adjusted free cash flow and other non-GAAP measures that are reconciled in the appendix. A webcast of this call is accessible on our website and will be available for replay. I would like to remind you that our commentary today will be including statements related to the expected future results of the company and are therefore forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our forecasted projection due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and the presentation. With that, I will turn it over to Craig. Craig Arnold : Okay. Thanks, Yan. We are pleased to report our Q3 results in another record quarter. Our team continued to deliver on our commitments, supported by strong markets and good execution. So, let me begin with some of the highlights on Page 3. As we have shared for some time now, megatrends, including reindustrialization, energy transition, electrification and digitalization are continuing to expand our markets, revenues, orders and negotiations pipeline as these trends are once again evident in our results in the quarter, especially in our Electrical Americas business. We posted another quarter of record financial results with strong revenue, margins, earnings and cash flow growth. While our markets continue to be strong, we\u2019re also continuing to improve on our overall effectiveness, which drove our record operating margins, and we\u2019re once again raising our earnings outlook. We\u2019re raising our \u201823 guidance for margins, adjusted EPS and cash flow. Our EPS growth for 2023 at the midpoint of our guidance is now 19%. I\u2019d also like to highlight our growing backlog, which was up 15% in Electrical and 22% in Aerospace. And we continue to have a strong book-to-bill ratio of 1.1 for Electrical and 1.2 for Aerospace. Lastly, we recorded record third quarter operating cash flow of $1.1 billion, up 18% and free cash flow margins of 16%. Tom will share additional details. But overall, as you can tell, we\u2019re pleased with the results and well positioned to close out a record year. Moving to Slide 4. In the last quarter, we shared a framework for how we think about our key market drivers for the company. The chart notes six megatrends that are driving growth capital investments and how they intersect with various businesses within Eaton. As you can see, we\u2019re uniquely positioned in most of our businesses and expect to see accelerated growth opportunities. It\u2019s our intention to cover each of these markets and megatrends during our earnings call and to keep you appraised of progress. In our Q2 earnings call, we provided a summary of progress on infrastructure spending, reindustrialization and the utility market in Electrical and our Aerospace business. Today, we\u2019ll spend a few minutes on how reindustrialization continues to drive a record number of mega projects in North America and how Eaton is positioned to win in the fast-growing data center market. We received an extensive number of questions on each of these topics and hope our updates are helpful as you think about the growth outlook for the company. So let\u2019s begin with Slide 5 in the presentation. We\u2019ve shared this chart previously, and the data is a good proxy for reindustrialization and what we\u2019re seeing inside of many of our markets. You\u2019ll recall this chart summarizes the number of mega projects that have been announced since January of 2021, and a mega project is a project with an announced value of $1 billion or more. Note that this is the North America data, but we\u2019re seeing a similar trend in Europe, although the dollar amounts are not as large. Three key points to note here. One, at $860 billion, this number is 3x the normal rate, which translates directly to future opportunities for electrical markets. As a reminder, the electrical content on these projects range from 3% to 5%. Two, this number continues to grow at a faster rate. Announced mega projects grew between 25 \u2013 grew 25% between Q3 and Q2, and Q2 was up 20% from Q1. This will not go on forever, but there continues to be strong momentum for industrial projects in North America. And third, only 20% of these projects have actually started. For those that have started, we\u2019ve won roughly $850 million of orders with a win rate of approximately 40%. And we\u2019re actively negotiating another $1 billion of electric content on a small subset of these announced mega projects. Turning to Slide 6. We highlight the data center market. I can\u2019t think of many markets that have better secular growth dynamics than data centers. The world\u2019s appetite for data, new insights and software solutions continues to grow at an exponential rate. And natural language processing, like ChatGPT, will only accelerate this trend. This is a very good thing for Eaton as we have a strong portfolio of data center solutions and the data center/IT channel represents 15% of our total revenue. While the numbers continue to be refined, we now think this market grows at a 16% compounded rate between 2022 and 2025 and likely for much longer. As expected, our customers are continuing to expand their data center CapEx build-outs, some of which are being modified to support the adoption of generative AI. Just consider some of these metrics. 120 zettabytes of data have been generated in 2023, a 60-fold increase over the 2 zettabytes generated in 2010. And the amount of data generated is expected to grow to 180 zettabytes by 2025, a 50% increase over 2023. And the AI impact is just starting to show up in our order book. During Q3, we won a large order of approximately $150 million for a new AI training data center and saw a roughly 61% increase in hyperscale orders overall. These AI data centers require both high-power and high-power density and as a result, higher electrical content. Another trend driving higher electric content is the need for solutions that allow bidirectional flow of power back to the grid and the ability to optimize the use of renewable energy to power data centers. So this market and Eaton are well positioned for higher growth for years to come. And on Page 7, we highlight Eaton\u2019s unique positioning in the data center market and note that we have the electrical industry\u2019s broadest portfolio of power manager solutions for data centers. Centralized data centers come in a variety of sizes with incoming power draws between 10 and 500 megawatts with the average data center of 40 to 50 megawatts, which is the variety that we show here on this slide. Eaton, we, support the flow of electrons from where they enter the facility from our transformers to our medium-voltage and low-voltage switchgear through our electrical busway to our uninterruptible power systems all the way into the server rooms, where we offer racks and power distribution units. In addition, we have a broad suite of software and service solutions that provide real-time diagnostics, prognostics and uptime support. As a rule of thumb, Eaton\u2019s market opportunity in data centers is about $1.5 million per megawatt. Here, we\u2019re distinguishing this market from the myriad of smaller data centers that exist to support many different markets and smaller applications. And we continue to improve our position in the market with our Brightlayer for data center suite of software solutions. This platform is the first in the industry to unite asset management, IT and operational device monitoring, power quality metrics and advanced electrical supervision into one single application. This new software provides electrical power, power quality, distributed IT equipment performance management that improves efficiency, data accuracy and certainly uptime. So overall, Eaton is well positioned and continues to build on our strength in this rapidly growing market. Given our broad set of megatrends and our growth outlook, we\u2019re naturally investing to add capacity in many of our businesses, as noted on Slide 8. In fact, on the normal run rate, we\u2019re investing more than $1 billion of capital to support the growth that we see over the next 5 years. These investments expand our production capacity across a wide range of markets and position Eaton to win more than our fair share of these opportunities. As you have heard, while somewhat improved, our lead times are still longer than ideal. And these investments will address the bottlenecks in our manufacturing sites. The primary investments are being made in utility markets to support transformers, both the regulators and our line insulation and production equipment and circuit breaker capacity to support the rapid growth in industrial projects and to add redundancy to our existing capability and in our global Electrical business to support growth in a number of fast-growing emerging markets, where we\u2019ve been gaining share but have ample opportunities to do significantly more. And of course, we\u2019re building a completely new eMobility business and making significant investments to build out new manufacturing capacity there. These capital investments support higher organic growth, provide excellent return on investment and are indicative of our confidence in the future of the company. We\u2019ve made some of these capital investments this year, while others will be layered in over the next couple of years. Now I\u2019ll turn it over to Tom to cover our financial results and outlook for the year. Tom Okray : Thanks, Craig. I\u2019ll start by providing a summary of our Q3 results, which include several records. With respect to the top line, we posted an all-time quarterly sales record of $5.9 billion. Organic growth continues to be strong, up 9% for the quarter, building upon 6 consecutive quarters of double-digit growth and 3 quarters on a 2-year stack of mid-20s growth. Operating profit recorded all-time records on both a margin and absolute basis. Operating profit grew 23%, and segment margin expanded 240 basis points to 23.6%. We posted a very strong incremental margin of 46%, up sequentially from 33% in Q2 and 27% in Q1. Adjusted EPS increased by 22% over the prior year to $2.47 per share, an all-time quarterly record and well above the high end of our guidance range. This performance resulted in a third quarter operating cash flow record. Our $1.14 billion in operating cash flow was 18% higher than the prior year, generating 16% free cash flow margin and over 100% free cash flow conversion. Looking at our results on a year-to-date basis. Organic growth is up 12%. Segment margin is up 170 basis points. We generated incremental margin of 35%, adjusted EPS growth of 19%, a 73% increase in operating cash flow versus prior year and free cash flow up 90% year-over-year. Moving on to the next slide. Our Electrical Americas business continues to execute well and delivered another very strong quarter. We set all-time quarterly records for sales, operating profit and margins. Organic sales growth remained very strong at 19%. Electrical Americas has generated double-digit organic growth for 7 consecutive quarters with 6 of the quarters greater than 15%. On a 2-year stack, organic growth is up 37%. In the quarter, there was broad-based growth in nearly all end markets with double-digit growth everywhere except residential and especially robust growth in industrial, utility, machine OEM and data center markets. Record operating margin of 27.7% was up 420 basis points versus prior year, benefiting from higher volumes and effective management of price cost. Incremental margin was 50% for the segment. On a rolling 12-month basis, orders were down 3%. It\u2019s important to note that the dollar value of orders remains high, and the decline needs to be viewed in context of the 36% order growth in Q3 of last year. As discussed on last quarter\u2019s call, order intake is an important metric but needs to be analyzed together with record backlog. Currently, in our Electrical sector, we have backlog coverage of almost 3x our historical average. We have looked at multiple scenarios with meaningful order intake decline and are confident in those scenarios, given our backlog coverage that we can generate robust organic growth for several quarters into 2025. In this regard, Electrical Americas backlog increased 19% year-over-year and 5% sequentially, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio above 1.1 on a rolling 12-month basis. For orders, we had particular strength in data center, industrial facilities and institutional markets. Also, our major project negotiations pipeline in Q3 was up 33% versus prior year and 19% sequentially from especially strong growth in data center, institutional, government and water, wastewater markets. Data center negotiations increased almost 4x. On a 2-year stack, our negotiation pipeline was up 180%. Overall, Electrical Americas continues to have a very strong year. On Page 11, you\u2019ll find the results for our Electrical Global segment. Despite flat organic growth, we posted a Q3 right sales record. We had strength in our commercial and institutional, industrial and utility markets. Regionally, we saw weakness in EMEA markets that were offset in other markets where growth was in line with expectations. We expect the softness in EMEA to be short-term with organic growth in the segment returning to low to mid-single digits in Q4. Operating margin of 21.8% was up 120 basis points compared to prior year. Operating profit and margin were all-time quarterly records. Margin improvements were primarily driven by effectively managing price cost. Orders were up 1% on a rolling 12-month basis with strength in data center and utility markets. Importantly, book-to-bill remained greater than 1. Before moving to our industrial businesses, I\u2019d like to briefly recap the combined electrical segments. For Q3, we posted organic growth of 11%, incremental margin of 53% and segment margin of 25.5%, which was up 320 basis points over prior year. On a rolling 12-month basis, our book-to-bill ratio for our electrical sector remains very strong at more than 1.1. We remain quite confident in our positioning for continued growth with strong margins in our overall electrical business. The next slide highlights our Aerospace segment. We posted all-time quarterly sales and operating profit records. Organic growth was 10% for the quarter with a 3% contribution from foreign exchange. We\u2019ve posted double-digit growth in 6 of the last 7 quarters in this segment. Growth was driven by broad strength across all markets with particularly strong growth in commercial OEM and commercial aftermarket, which were up 21% and 27%, respectively. Operating margin of 24.1% was up 10 basis points on a year-over-year basis and up 160 basis points sequentially. Growth in orders and backlog continue to be very strong. On a rolling 12-month basis, orders increased 16% with especially strong growth in commercial OEM, commercial aftermarket and defense OEM. Year-over-year backlog increased 22% in Q3 and 4% sequentially, reflecting continued momentum in the Aerospace recovery. On a rolling 12-month basis, our book-to-bill for our Aerospace segment remains very strong at 1.2. Moving to our Vehicle segment on Page 13. In the quarter, organic growth was down 1%. Foreign exchange had a 2% favorable impact. We saw growth in APAC, North American automotive and EMEA markets more than offset by a decline in North American Class 8 and South American markets. Operating margins came in at 17.4%, 60 basis points above prior year driven by effective price cost management, partially offset by lower sales volumes. 17.4% margins represents 210 basis points of sequential increase primarily driven by manufacturing efficiency improvements. We continue to pursue and win new business in growth areas such as EV torque win with a major Chinese OEM. We also have momentum winning program length extensions and volume increases with multiple OEMs globally. On Page 14, we show results for our eMobility business. We generated another strong quarter of growth, including an all-time sales record. Revenue was up 19%, all organic. Margin improved 150 basis points versus prior year to breakeven. The result was mostly driven by higher volumes from ramping programs and improved manufacturing productivity. Overall, we remain very encouraged by the growth prospects of the eMobility segment. So far in 2023, we have won new programs worth $1.1 billion of mature year revenues. This is nearly a 145% increase in new program wins since the $450 million highlighted in last quarter\u2019s earnings call. Through these wins, we continue to find opportunities to leverage expertise and differentiated technologies across segments. Should be noted, we have increased our interim revenue target for 2025 by 25% from $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion. Moving to Page 15. We show our Electrical and Aerospace backlog updated through Q3. As you can see, we continue to build backlog with Electrical stepping up to $9.4 billion and Aerospace reaching $3.1 billion, sequential increases of 5% and 4%, respectively. Both businesses have increased their backlogs by significantly more than 100% since Q3 2020. The backlog build gives us confidence in our order outlook for the quarters to come. On the next page, we show our fiscal year organic growth and operating margin guidance. For organic growth, we are increasing Electrical Americas, lowering Electrical Global and eMobility, while narrowing the range of our total organic growth, resulting in a 50 basis point increase at the midpoint. We now expect organic growth in Electrical Americas to be 16.5% to 18.5%, up 250 basis points from our prior 14% to 16% guidance. This represents 850 basis points improvement from our initial 2023 guidance. For Electrical Global, we\u2019re lowering our organic growth guidance from 6% to 8% to 4% to 6% based on weaker-than-expected end markets in Europe. For eMobility, the midpoint of our organic growth guidance is now 25% versus 35% mostly due to OEM-related delays for their EV platforms. For segment margins, we\u2019re increasing our total Eaton margin guidance range by 50 basis points. This is a result of an improved outlook in Electrical Americas, where we increased the range by 150 basis points on strong demand and continued operational execution. We are lowering margin guidance for Electrical Global 50 basis points due to lower growth. The 21.8% midpoint comfortably exceeds our target to reach 21.5% by 2025 and represents a 160 basis point increase versus prior year. In summary, as we approach the final quarter of 2023, we remain well positioned to deliver another very strong year of financial performance. On Page 17, we have additional guidance metrics for 2023 and Q4. Following our strong year-to-date performance and improved margin expectations, we are raising our full year EPS range to $8.95 per share to $9.05 per share. The $9 midpoint represents 19% growth in adjusted EPS over the prior year. We\u2019re also raising our operating cash flow and free cash flow guidance ranges by $100 million each to reflect our stronger earnings and solid working capital management. For Q4, we are guiding organic growth of 8% to 10%, segment margins of 22.3% to 22.7%, representing 170 basis point improvement at the midpoint versus prior year. Adjusted EPS is a range of $2.39 to $2.49, an 18% increase versus prior year at the midpoint. The next chart summarizes the progression of our guidance in 2023. Throughout the year, we\u2019ve demonstrated the ability to execute on our commitments and raise guidance for all of the metrics shown. We are well on track to deliver our third year in a row of double-digit organic growth with all-time record margins in a $1 billion or nearly 40% increase in operating cash flow. Now I\u2019ll hand it back to Craig. Craig Arnold : Thanks, Tom. So moving to Page 19 and turning our attention to next year. We provided our initial view on what we expect from our end markets. And first, I would note this as a starting point, we haven\u2019t changed our view on 2023. And as you can see, we\u2019re expecting attractive growth in nearly all of our markets in 2024. We expect strong double-digit growth in data centers and distributed IT segment, in utilities, commercial aerospace and electric vehicles. Additionally, we expect solid growth within industrial facilities, commercial and institutional and defense aerospace. And as you can see, global light vehicle market should be modestly positive with only the residential and commercial vehicle markets experiencing a decline. So it should be another year of significant growth with over 80% of our end markets seeing solid or better growth. Please note that much of this growth is supported by record backlogs, and we\u2019ll provide more detailed color on organic growth as we come together with our 2024 guidance in February of next year. As you can see from the outlook, despite mixed signals in the economy and some historical indicators of growth, Eaton remains very well positioned to deliver what we call differentiated growth in 2024 and beyond. So I\u2019ll close with a summary on Page 22 \u2013 on Page 20. Last quarter, I noted that we\u2019re feeling good about how our markets are performing. And today, I reiterate that sentiment. We continue to experience powerful megatrends that are driving a higher outlook for our end markets, and we\u2019re seeing it in our negotiations and order book. And once again, we delivered another record quarter of financial results, increased our earnings and cash flow outlook. Our orders continue to come in at historically high levels, and we continue to grow our backlog. I would note that our team is executing well, but we have an opportunity to be better everywhere than I\u2019d say in every business. So the setup for 2024 is playing out as we expected, and it should be another strong year. With that, we will open it up for any questions you may have. Yan Jin : Thanks, Craig. [Operator Instructions] With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to the operator to give you guys the instructions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The first question will come from the line of Andrew Obin from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Andrew Obin : Hi, guys. Good morning. Craig Arnold : Good morning, Andy. Andrew Obin : Just a question on incrementals, just very nice progression in Electrical Americas from first quarter into third quarter and overall for the company. So how should we think about just incremental progression to the fourth quarter and \u201824 because I think within your framework, you\u2019ve used a lower number. Just maybe expand what\u2019s driving these strong incrementals and how sustainable it is going forward? Craig Arnold : I appreciate the question, Andrew. And our team certainly performed extremely well during the quarter, and we\u2019re proud of our teams and how well they executed in the quarter. And certainly, implied in the guidance are pretty attractive incremental as well. Maybe I\u2019ll answer the last question kind of first with respect to as we think about incrementals going forward in 2024, and we still think 30% incrementals are the right way to think about the incrementals for the company. Clearly, we\u2019re making some investments in the business that are going to kind of moderate incrementals. And certainly, if you think about price versus cost and the tailwinds that they provided during the course of 2023, we\u2019re not expected to see the same order of magnitude of tailwinds in 2024. So we still think 30% is a good planning number for next year. And \u2013 but certainly, as we think about Q3 and Q4, we have a pretty strong line of sight to those incrementals that are embedded in our forecast for Q4. Andrew Obin : Thank you. And just a follow-up question. You keep announcing additional capacity additions. If I look at Slide 19, you sort of give end market growth assumptions. So how should we quantify the outgrowth opportunity or revenue from capacity additions, particularly relative to your end market assumptions? Thank you. Craig Arnold : This is kind of a really attractive problem to have, Andrew, in terms of the growth that we\u2019re seeing in many of our businesses and having to make some investments to deal with the stronger demand that we\u2019ve seen over the last few years and certainly the demand that we expect to see into the future. And so we talk about kind of this growth outlook for the company in these strong markets. And we need to make some investments in capacity and some key bottlenecks. We talked about the $1 billion in my opening outbound commentary and where it\u2019s going. And I\u2019d say that these investments that we\u2019re putting in will give us the capacity that we need to support the long-term growth outlook for the company and a little headwind above that if markets turn out to be even a bit stronger than what we anticipated. And so we are making the investments that we should be making and we need to make to get out in front of the pretty robust outlook that we have for the company\u2019s growth. Andrew Obin : Thanks so much. Craig Arnold : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Joe Ritchie : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Craig Arnold : Good morning, Joe. Joe Ritchie : Hey, Craig, can you maybe just talk a little bit about the mega projects for a second? I think you mentioned that 20% of the projects have started. When you think about the timing of when you typically will see a \u2013 like bidding on those projects and the orders coming through, how do you see this kind of playing out based on, again, the projects that have already started and now the funnel is continuing to increase? Craig Arnold : Yes. I appreciate the question, and it\u2019s certainly something that we\u2019ve spent a fair amount of time internally trying to sort to ourselves. And as you can imagine, inside of this broad array of mega projects, there is very different types of projects that are embedded in those numbers, some of which where you\u2019d have essentially a 12-month kind of cycle, others of which could have 3-year cycles or longer. So it\u2019s a pretty wide distribution of lead times depending upon the type of projects that we\u2019re talking about. So I\u2019d say that at this juncture, if you had to use a rule of thumb, I\u2019d say you\u2019re probably \u2013 because these tend to be the bigger projects unlike our flow business, they are probably a couple of years on average in terms of from when we actually start and price a project to actually showing up in revenue inside of the company. If you can figure on average a couple of years out is the way to think about it. I would say that talking about these mega projects in general, we\u2019ve gotten so many questions. There is been so much written about this particular topic. I would say today that, that is principally perhaps more than anything else, what\u2019s driving this fundamental change in the growth prospects of the company. I mean, these huge projects, much bigger than they have ever been historically. And by the way, I\u2019d note that 60% of these projects are related to whether it\u2019s IRA, the IIJA or the CHIPS Act. And so these are really big projects. They are different projects. And they are projects that are, quite frankly, being subsidized in many ways by this government spending that\u2019s taking place more broadly inside of the U.S. economy. So we think these projects are solid. They are going to go forward and we think, once again, going to be really attractive growth tailwind for the company. Tom Okray : And just to complement that, Craig, I mean, those are the mega projects, but we also said in the prepared remarks our negotiated pipeline for the U.S., which was up 33% year-over-year and up 18% sequentially. So a lot of good growth going on in those big projects but less than the $1 billion as well. Joe Ritchie : Yes, that\u2019s great color, guys. And I guess just my quick follow-on there is just any concern that you have at this point? There is a lot of concern in the market regarding project financing and specifically, I think you guys called out utility CapEx, the market being up double digits next year. Just any thoughts around the project financing issue, higher interest costs and whether that pushes things out a bit. Craig Arnold : Yes. It\u2019s certainly one of the things that we\u2019re watching and we\u2019re concerned about as well, Joe. It\u2019s perfectly logical to say that some of these projects could be delayed or put at risk, given much higher financing cost. I will tell you that we\u2019ve not seen any evidence, any material evidence of that to date. But it\u2019s certainly, once again, a potential risk. And that\u2019s why I highlight this issue around 60% of these projects basically being financially supported by these government stimulus plans, which is very new. And the dollars, as you know, are quite substantial. And at this point, we will have to wait and see how it plays out. And we\u2019re going to watch it and make sure that we\u2019re taking the necessary precautions. But to date, we really haven\u2019t seen that impact. Tom Okray : Joe, year-to-date in the Americas, utility is up over 25%. And if you look at the entire electrical sector year-to-date are up over 20%. So it remains very strong. Joe Ritchie : Great. Thank you, both. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research. Please go ahead. Jeff Sprague : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Craig Arnold : Good morning, Jeff. Jeff Sprague : Hi, good morning. Can we pivot a little bit to Electrical Global? And just maybe a little bit more color on kind of the complexion of demand underneath the surface there by geography. And you noted some project activity starting to come to the floor there. It does seem like Europe, in particular, might end up in a bit of a bidding war with the U.S. on project stimulus and the like. So maybe just a little bit of color there on how you see things playing out into the first half of next year, not just Q4, but what kind of pipeline might be building. Craig Arnold : Appreciate the question, Jeff. And if you think about today, what makes up the global business for us, there is what we do in Asia, there is what we do and what we call GEIS, which was the former crowd science B-Line business. And then it\u2019s our electrical Europe business. Those are the three pieces that make up global for us. And I will say that we know, without a doubt, did see a slowdown in our European business during the course of our business specifically. We\u2019re a pretty big player into what you call the manufacturing or the OEM segment, and that segment was especially weak. Our business in Asia continued to perform well, growing high single digits. Our GEIS business continued to perform fine, mid-single digit consistent with what we expected. It\u2019s really what took place during the course of the quarter in Europe, specifically in electrical, that drove the miss of our own expectations and the reduction in our outlook. Now we \u2013 without a doubt, we saw some destocking in the distribution channel and having \u2013 had a number of conversations in person with some of our large distributors in Europe, it\u2019s clear that they were doing some inventory adjustments, some overbuying that took place over the last 12 months or so. And we do think that, that segment gets back to mid-single-digit growth in Q4. And we think, once again, these fundamental trends that we talked about with respect to electrification, energy transition, digital growth and data centers, all of those trends are applicable for Europe as well. And so we do think while slower growth than the U.S., we think those markets get back to growth once we work through this inventory correction that we\u2019ve seen here in the third quarter. Tom Okray : Encouragingly, Jeff, we\u2019ve seen some good order flow in EMEA. So that gives us \u2013 it gives us confidence to go to the low mid-single digits in Q4. Craig Arnold : But we will keep watching it. I mean, clearly, there is a lot of geopolitical tensions in the region there as well. And we\u2019re not going to be pollyannish about it. And if we need to make some adjustments, we will make the adjustments we need to make. Jeff Sprague : Great. And maybe just as a follow-up, different topic, though, is just thanks for the little many deep dive on data centers here. Can you just speak to how your content is changing? So obviously, you gave us a $1.5 million per megawatt, and we got a lot of megawatts coming, right? So you just grow on the back of that for sure. But is your dollar content per megawatt also going up as part of this equation and how so, where has it been? And where is it headed in your view? Craig Arnold : Yes. What I would tell you is that the simple answer to the question is yes. We are essentially selling more content per megawatt because we\u2019re selling more software solutions. We\u2019re selling more complete data center solutions into the marketplace. So that would be absolutely true. That impact is kind of dwarfed by just the overall growth in the market though. I mean, the market, as we\u2019ve talked about, continues to be quite robust. And just maybe some of the data if you look at simply the backlog of projects today in data center in the planning stages, it surpassed $100 billion for the first time ever greater than 6 years of construction, $12 billion in the month of September alone, starts up some 29% driven by the big four and some $42 billion under construction. So the whole market is growing quite dramatically right now. And obviously, what\u2019s happening today in AI is accelerating that. And if you think about the content opportunity for electrical equipment alone in an AI-centric data center, it\u2019s 5x the growth, the opportunity when you compare it to a conventional data center. Now having said that, there clearly are some very real constraints in terms of the industry\u2019s ability to really deal with the demand that\u2019s out in front of us. Huge backlog, huge negotiations. We have historically operated with some 3 years, let\u2019s say, of visibility in data center market. We now have more than, in some cases, 5 years of visibility on projects. And so the whole market is just performing extremely well, and we\u2019d expect it to do so for years to come. Tom Okray : Just to amplify, Jeff, just a little bit more on that, year-to-date in data centers, again, on our negotiation standpoint up 136%. And in the quarter, as we said in the prepared remarks, up 4x. So it\u2019s growing faster than it was at the beginning of the year as well. Jeff Sprague : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Scott Davis from Melius Research. Please go ahead. Scott Davis : Hey, good morning, guys. Craig Arnold : Hey, Scott. Good morning. Scott Davis : Not much to pick on, really solid results across the board. But I was wondering if we could talk a little bit about M&A and maybe opportunities to play offense here while cash flow is cooking. And I was thinking, in particular, is there any opportunities out there to really scale up the eMobility segment to make either \u2013 whether it\u2019s several interesting bolt-ons or something a little bit larger to get that to scale a little faster than maybe the current pace? Craig Arnold : I appreciate the question, Scott. And first of all, I would say that with respect to M&A more generally, we said our priorities will be Electrical. They will be Aerospace. And then on the margin, if we could find the right asset, we would consider an acquisition in eMobility as well. But I think the broader message for the company is that we have enormous growth opportunities in front of us, the organic opportunities that we\u2019re looking at across the business and our ability to grow organically. And I\u2019d say, today, there are just growth opportunities every place. And unlike perhaps some times past, we don\u2019t need to do deals to significantly grow the company. And that\u2019s true as well in eMobility. As you heard in Tom\u2019s presentation, we just had another quarter of huge wins, $600 million, Tom, was the number, I believe, in terms of quarter-over-quarter change? Tom Okray : Yes, yes. It\u2019s up 25%. Craig Arnold : So each one of these wins in eMobility just results in just enormous growth for the organization. And so we set this chart of being $2 billion to $4 billion by 2030. We will be selective. We will essentially \u2013 as we talked about in some of the prior conversations, we will make sure that we\u2019re going to play in eMobility, where we have the ability to leverage our scale, our technology and the expertise in our core electrical business. That\u2019s where we have the right to win. That\u2019s where we have the right to play, and that\u2019s where we can really deliver attractive margins for Eaton. And so that\u2019s really strategically what we\u2019re focused on with respect to the areas of interest that we have in eMobility. So it really is about power distribution, power protection, doing the same things that we do in our core Electrical business. We get scale that we can leverage into eMobility at the same time, leverage that scale back into our core Electrical business. So I\u2019d say today, you could expect us in terms of the thinking about M&A, tuck-ins, things that are very much digestible. Those are the kinds of opportunities we\u2019re looking at in general, and those are the things today that I think makes sense for the company in terms of where we are today with respect to our organic growth opportunities in front of us. Tom Okray : Yes. Just to add a little bit more. The long-term target, as Craig said and we said in the prepared remarks, up 25%. But even since last quarter, our mature year wins was up 145%. That said, we\u2019ve got a ton of flexibility. Net leverage on the balance sheet, 1 5. So we\u2019re always looking, but we do have a lot of food on the table, as Craig said. Scott Davis : That\u2019s helpful. And guys, just to back up a little bit. If you think about Eaton historically, had been a company that always manage price around raw materials, particularly kind of steel and copper. Is the algorithm more likely in the future going to be pricing around the value you\u2019re adding or perhaps pricing kind of dislocates from the underlying commodities? Or is that just kind of a bridge too far from how kind of customers are conditioned? Craig Arnold : Yes. I\u2019d like to think, Scott, that we were always value pricing, but I think I get your broader message with respect to the whole market dynamics around price versus cost. And certainly, when you\u2019re in a capacity-constrained market, it certainly gives you a bit more leverage than you\u2019ve had historically. But I\u2019d just say, in general, as we think about the strategy for the company is that we intend to earn our margin accretion by running our businesses better, by running the company better and eliminating waste and inefficiencies. And we will recover inflation where we see it through price. But the margin expansion for the company, we really intend to rely on volume leverage, improving operating efficiencies in the way we run the company. And those opportunities, by the way, despite record profitability, as I said in my outbound commentary, those opportunities are everywhere. We\u2019re still not running the company nearly as efficiently as we know we can. Scott Davis : That\u2019s very good. Helpful, thank you. Best of luck, guys. Thank you. Craig Arnold : Thanks, Scott. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Steve Tusa : Hi, congrats on the good results. Craig Arnold : Thank you, Steve. Steve Tusa : Just trying to reconcile the $850 million in orders with I think you said 20% of the mega products have started. That\u2019s obviously a pretty big number, but $850 million in orders is relatively small. I mean, I guess that just speaks to where you guys are, the thing starts and then you get the order. Like can you just reconcile those two numbers? Craig Arnold : Yes. And it\u2019s really \u2013 you really can\u2019t necessarily recognize \u2013 reconcile those two numbers and \u2013 because a start doesn\u2019t mean that we\u2019ve even got an opportunity to bid the project yet much less a negotiation or a win. And so you really can\u2019t reconcile those two numbers. And I know it\u2019s such a big number and a very attractive one that everybody is trying to get their head around exactly how it\u2019s going to impact revenue for the organization. But those two numbers, you really can\u2019t reconcile them. What we\u2019re trying to provide is a bit of a framework is this win rate of 40%, which is essentially slightly above our underlying market shares in North America as an indication of what you can expect as these projects play out into the future. But you really can\u2019t link the 20% to the $850 million. Steve Tusa : Well, I mean, I think you just did. You basically said it\u2019s out in front of you. Yes. I think you just explained it. And then just one last one on the kind of stock and ship business, if you will. I know you guys do \u2013 you\u2019re a bit more systems-oriented, but Hubbell today continue to talk about destocking, and there is a lot of other industrials talking about that. Are you guys seeing that in parts of your business, and you just kind of blowing through it because the other businesses, the supply-demand equation is just so strong that you\u2019re kind of weathering some destock in some parts of the business? Maybe just talk about some of those flow businesses and what you\u2019re seeing on the distribution side. Craig Arnold : No, I think you\u2019ve summarized it well. I mean, we are seeing very similar trends in some of the shorter-cycle businesses inside of our company, whether that\u2019s residential or whether what we\u2019re seeing today in the MOM segment or the IT channel. We, too, are seeing a slowdown. And we, too, are \u2013 experienced a bit of destocking in certain aspects of the business. And so that \u2013 those trends that others have talked about are certainly evident in our business as well. But I think you hit the nail on the head when you said that the other parts of the business, our systems and large project business, our data center business, the other pieces where we\u2019re seeing the strength is just overwhelming those spots where we\u2019re having this weakness. Now in Europe, we talked about it in our commentary, we did see weakness in Europe. And those trends clearly showed up in our European Electrical business in the quarter. It\u2019s one of the reasons why we reduced the guidance there. But by contrast, we had this really outside strength. And we continue to see outside strength in the systems and the project-related business in the Americas that offset the weakness in the flow business in North America as well as what we\u2019ve seen in Europe. Steve Tusa : Right. So that would actually be an easy comp for next year in those businesses, assuming things recouple the trend line. Craig Arnold : Well, I mean, nothing is easy. And it\u2019s certainly probably too early to put our hand on the scale and predict what\u2019s going to happen in Europe during the course of 2024. But you\u2019re right. I mean, given the fact that those businesses are weakening, assuming the market stabilizes and the inventory destocking is behind us and we certainly have embedded some of that in our Q4 outlook, yes, it should be a relatively better year for sure in Europe. Steve Tusa : Great. Thanks a lot. Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. And the next question is from Chris Snyder from UBS. Please go ahead. Chris Snyder : Hi, thank you. I wanted to follow-up on some of the data center commentary. So I think you said negotiations up 4x in Q3, so building as the year goes on. Is that increase in conversations all driven by AI? Are you seeing a broadening base of customers that are talking to you on the data center topic? And then when we think about the AI tailwinds, is there any benefit in 2023? Or is the tailwind from that really more 2024? Thank you. Craig Arnold : Yes. No, appreciate the question. It\u2019s obviously a topic that\u2019s gotten a lot of attention. And I\u2019d say that I would tell you, first of all, while AI and ChatGPT have gotten a lot of publicity of late, it\u2019s not new. I mean, it has been around for some time. And so we have historically seen some benefit of AI embedded in the data center market. I\u2019d tell you that, number one. Secondly, as I said in my outbound commentary, yes, the AI-centric bids and orders were up 4x, but we had a 61% increase in hyperscale in general. And that is really across the broad data center market. And so without a doubt, AI will be an accelerator of growth. But the broader message is essentially more data, more information, more insights requiring more data centers. And those numbers are big and growing as well. Chris Snyder : I appreciate that. And then maybe just following up on the intersection of orders and backlog. Orders in the Americas have obviously moderated for about a year now. And your guys have built electrical backlog pretty much every quarter over that time period. So as we kind of look forward, do you expect the company to start meaningfully working into that backlog? Or are we just kind of in a period of maybe sideways backlog levels into 2024? Any color on that would be helpful. Thank you. Craig Arnold : Yes, appreciate the question, and it\u2019s certainly one that we\u2019re spending some time trying to work through ourselves. I mean, orders have moderated. We talked about in the Americas, but we also were comping a 36% increase from last year. And so moderation off of a really big number last year, and the backlog does continue to grow. I think it\u2019s really, in many ways, kind of the $64,000 question. It\u2019s backlog is a function of how much demand you\u2019re getting versus your ability to satisfy that demand. And at this point, I can only tell you based upon what we\u2019ve seen and experienced to date is that we\u2019ve not been able to materially eat into the backlog. We will at some point. I mean, this cannot go on forever. And we are adding some capacity. For sure, that\u2019s going to help resolve some of the lead time issues and the bottleneck issues. And so we would expect backlog at some point to turn negative in absolute terms because keep in mind, we\u2019re up 3x. We\u2019re running a backlog of $9.4 billion in our Electrical business, $3.1 billion in Aerospace, but $9.4 billion in Electrical, and that\u2019s 3x the historical backlog levels. And so yes, one, it\u2019s a function of the fact that markets are good. And \u2013 but secondly, it is a function of the fact we got to get out in front of some of these capacity planning things so that we can satisfy all this demand. But at some point, backlogs will turn negative. Tom Okray : Yes. And this is what I was trying to get at in my prepared remarks, just to amplify it a little bit more. And this is where we\u2019ve modeled the scenarios of meaningful order intake decline on a year-over-year basis. And given how big the backlog is right now in the backlog coverage, the 3x, as Craig said, we think even with meaningful year-over-year order intake decline and robust organic growth, this is going to take us several quarters into 2025 before we get back to historical levels, so... Craig Arnold : And I would say we probably never get back to historical levels if you think about it in terms of absolute terms, right? We will be better, but we will never probably get back to a $3 billion kind of backlog. It\u2019s a bigger business we will need. And so we will run a bigger backlog simply to support the fact that it\u2019s a large, large business. But what we certainly would expect to, at some point, start eating into the backlog. Chris Snyder : Yes. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of Nicole DeBlase from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Craig Arnold : Hi, Nicole. Nicole DeBlase : Can we just talk a little bit about the capacity investments that you guys are making and just the cadence of when that\u2019s going to start kind of phasing and coming online over the next several years? Craig Arnold : Yes. So appreciate the question, Nicole. And I would tell you that some of these investments have been made already. And we already are bringing on new capacity in products like circuit breakers and the like. Other investments are just now in the early phases. If you think about some of the investments that we are making in transformer capacity in voltage regulators, and that capacity is probably order of magnitude 12 months to 18 months out. So, it does vary depending upon which particular piece of the investment that you are referring to. But I would say, in all cases, the commitments have been made. In all cases, we are looking at essentially those aspects of our business where we obviously have more capacity \u2013 more growth, more backlog than we certainly have capacity to serve it. And at this point, our teams are kind of geared up for ensuring that we execute it well and bring this capacity online. It allows us to continue to grow the company and take some market share. Nicole DeBlase : Thanks Craig. And then just on free cash flow, thinking about how this progresses into 2024. Can you talk a little bit about your plans to reduce working capital and other major puts and takes that could influence conversion next year? Thank you. Tom Okray : Yes. Appreciate the question, Nicole. I think the important thing is to look at year-to-date when you are looking at operating cash flow and free cash flow. I mean we had a good quarter, but year-to-date, we are up 73% in operating cash flow and almost 90% in free cash flow. And if you look at the improvement levers for year-to-date, it\u2019s about split between higher earnings and better working capital. And if you recall, last year, we said we were investing in our customers and investing in the growth and believe that was the right decision. In the back half of last year, we started getting more efficient with working capital. We expect that to continue going into 2024. We are happy with our free cash flow margin this quarter of 16%. But we have got a lot of opportunity to improve in terms of inventory days on hand, getting better in terms of DSO, our cash conversion cycle. So, we are not stopping here, we are happy with our progress, but we have got a lot of opportunity for better cash flow going forward. Nicole DeBlase : Thanks Tom. I will pass it on. Operator : The next question is from the line of Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Please go ahead. Julian Mitchell : Hi. Good morning. Maybe I just wanted to ask a quick question about the sort of core revenue or organic revenue outlook. So, you had that very helpful slide on the main end market moving pieces. Should we sort of assume from that, that that blends to about kind of 6%, 7% market growth, and then you are adding about a point or so of share, and that\u2019s kind of how you get that 7% to 8% organic growth number for next year that you discussed, I think in September? Craig Arnold : I appreciate the question, Julian. And obviously, it\u2019s certainly early for us to give you kind of a definitive side on where we think 2024 will be, and we will do that in February. But I do think that kind of the framework and the way you talked about it is very much consistent with the way we are thinking about it. We talked about kind of the exit rate of the year in that 7% to 8%. And that\u2019s kind of a good proxy for the way to think about 2024, subject to whatever changes that we see between now and the end of the year. But that \u2013 those market outlook slides are very much consistent with our current view. And unless things go sideways someplace in the world, which we don\u2019t anticipate, that would be a good kind of starting point to think about it. Julian Mitchell : That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And then just one thing I wanted to circle back to was around the sort of gap between the products and the systems on the electrical side. I guess historically, you had \u2013 those were sort of two sides of one coin, the products, the shorter-cycle piece, systems is the longer cycle piece and sort of where the lag one would follow the other. So, when we are thinking about next year, the gap between products and systems presumably narrows. Is the assumption that they sort of meet in the middle, products improve a bit, systems slows down because of comps, or any kind of way we should think about it maybe projects or mega projects mean the systems piece sustains a very wide outgrowth versus products, for example. Craig Arnold : Yes. I appreciate that question, Julian. And I would tell you from where we sit, I mean this products versus systems view of the electrical markets, we would suggest it\u2019s probably not the most effective way to think about it in general. And it\u2019s one of the reasons why we changed our reporting structure. And we have been so much focused on the end markets that we serve. And so we really do the better model and the way \u2013 better way to think about the company is here are the big end markets that we serve, commercial and institutional data centers, utilities, residential. These are the big end markets that we serve. And in every one of these large end markets for the most part, they will accept \u2013 can take a product. In some cases, we will sell a system or a solution into these same end markets. And so what we tried to do and the framework that we provided is give you a sense of what we think is going to take place in these end markets. And where you see differences in the way our businesses perform, take Europe, for example, versus the U.S., we have today in the U.S., a much bigger percentage of our business that would go into end markets like data center and utility than we would have in our business in Europe, where they would be much more indexed into, let\u2019s say, the MOEM segment, which is in decline in Europe or in the residential section \u2013 segment, which is really in decline everywhere. So, I think that\u2019s a better way to think about how to model the company than this distinction between a product and a system. Julian Mitchell : That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Steve Volkmann from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Steve Volkmann : Hi. Great. Thank you, guys for fitting me in. Just a quick follow-up to go back to this kind of backlog thing, which I think you guys have explained pretty well. But Craig, is it a reasonable planning assumption that we end 2024 at sort of whatever the new normal is for backlogs that\u2019s slightly higher than historical number? Craig Arnold : Yes. I will tell you. And I wish I had an answer to that question definitively, Steve, in terms of what that backlog is going to look like at the end of 2024. I can tell you what we said about this year that we didn\u2019t anticipate this year that we could materially eat into the backlog because, once again, we knew what the underlying orders look like. We understood, essentially have a very good view on what our markets would be and what our capacity is. We are bringing on some new capacity that will come online in 2024. That will help us eat into the backlog. Having said that, are we going to end 2024 at the same level as we are today, we would hope quite frankly, that we can reduce backlog during the course of 2024. We would view that as a successful year all else being equal because it\u2019s given us the ability to shorten lead times and do a better job of responding to customer demand. But sitting here today, I mean to suggest that I would have any visibility into what that number is going to be at the end of 2024, this would not be realistic. And so we hope that we can reduce backlog by essentially shortening up some lead times. But at this point, if the markets continue to be as robust as they have been, that will be challenging. Tom Okray : Yes. Even reducing backlog, it would be hard to imagine based on the scenarios we have looked at that we would get our backlog at the end of 2024 to our historical backlog coverage. Craig Arnold : Yes. Well, we probably will never get back there. But hopefully, we can reduce backlog. Tom Okray : For sure, yes. Steve Volkmann : Great. That\u2019s definitely helpful. And then I am going to pivot to the AI question, but I want to ask it from the other point of view, which is that I think you guys actually capture a fair amount of data from collected IoT devices, etcetera. So, can you just comment on sort of where you are in terms of collecting your own data and providing services and systems that leverage that data into maybe new business models over the next few years? Craig Arnold : No, definitely appreciate that question. And as you know, this is independent of AI, we had been on this journey inside the company to really digitize and digitalize our company. And so that what we said is that every single product, every new product that we develop, we expect it to have a microprocessor to be able to stream and process data and information. And so that has been going on inside of the company for the better part of the last 5 years. And as a result of that, we have been able to create some really attractive and interesting new value propositions around how we essentially can monetize our own data. And it\u2019s one of the things that we wrap up in this term you will hear us talk about called the Brightlayer platform. So, we have Brightlayer for data centers, Brightlayer for utility markets and Brightlayer for residential. So, this data platform that we use today to essentially find ways to monetize our data either in the form of data-as-a-service or software is something that\u2019s happening broadly across the company and all enabled by the fact that all of our devices today, most of our devices today, I should say, are intelligent and have the ability to stream data. I would encourage for those of you on the call, one of the things we are going to try to do next year as a part of our investor meeting is to invite you to our center in Houston and to show you some very real examples of software and data solutions that we are selling today in various applications to our customer base that really monetizes our data and monetizes our software. So, a really exciting piece of this leg that we talk about these megatrends, one of which is digitalization, we see that in the data center market. And we also see that in the way we are bringing new products and new solutions to market as well across the company. Steve Volkmann : Great. I look forward to that. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And the next question is from Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Nigel Coe : Hey. Good afternoon and thanks for keeping that\u2019s going here. Slide 19 is good, obviously, very helpful. Just want to clarify a couple of things. So, data center, the 16% CAGR you are forecasting through \u201825 now, that\u2019s for the market, so not necessarily Eaton, right? So, I know you have got some market share growth ambitions there. So, I just want to make that clear. And then when you talk about data center, are we talking here about the whole market? So obviously, a big chunk of that market is on-prem enterprise data centers, or are we talking about a subset of that market? So, just maybe just clarify that. And then within this end market matrix, I am pretty sure that if you put this up three months ago, you might have had a bit more of an optimistic view on residential. Obviously, with the higher rates, etcetera, I understand why you are cautious there. And I know it\u2019s not a big end market, but I am actually wondering if you are starting to see deterioration real time in that market or whether it\u2019s much more sort of macro-driven? Craig Arnold : Okay. So, I think there is three different questions there, but let\u2019s take the first one around. So, the answer to the question is, yes, it is the entire market. So, that 16% growth rate is reflective of what\u2019s happening in hyperscale, on-prem, colo. So, it is our view of the entire market. And yes, we would expect our businesses to grow faster than market and as a result of that do better than what we think the underlying market is doing. To the point around residential, yes, we have seen the slowdown in residential really around the world. And we have seen it in the U.S. and what happened in single-family first, though single family, quite frankly, had a little bit of a stronger Q4. Single-family starts were actually up some 6% in Q3. Multifamily wallet kind of record levels of units that are under construction clearly saw a slowdown in Q3. But we are definitely seeing the slowdown in residential. You see it most acutely, quite frankly, in Europe. Many of you see the market data coming out of Germany and France where residential housing starts are down quite significantly, and everybody has read about what\u2019s going on in China as well. But to your point, residential as a company is not the biggest piece of our market. And I think the other thing I would add to that is that one of the things we have talked about in prior meetings is that we are seeing higher electrical content in all of the new homes that are built as they meet the latest requirements for UL standards in the U.S. or other standards, IEC standards around Europe or we see smart homes being built, and they are putting in more smart solutions. And so offsetting somewhat of that decline in units is the fact that we are seeing higher electrical content in new homes. And new homes are accounting for, quite frankly, a much higher percentage of the new housing market in general as people hold on to their legacy homes. And so yes, no question, residential has weakened up. We are seeing it in our business. But once again, the strength that we are seeing in the other end markets, big enough to offset those declines in residential. Tom Okray : Yes. Just to add [ph] a little bit, Nigel, on that one. If you look at year-to-date and no question slowing down, but year-to-date for our overall electrical sector, we are actually positive from a residential perspective. Craig Arnold : And I think it\u2019s more a function of electrical content being higher, prices being better, the unit volumes would be down definitely as they would for others. Nigel Coe : Yes, I know there are there parts to that question. But if I can just sneak one more in, I know we are running light. The eMobility 2025 target of 1.5 is a big step-up from the prior 1.2. Does that uplift and that\u2019s sort of like that growth ramp from here to 1.5, does that come to support in \u201825, or do you expect it to be a bit more linear through the next couple of years? And does that \u2013 is there any implications for margins, I think you have got 11% margin for 2025, how do we think about that? That\u2019s two questions. Craig Arnold : Yes. I think that you would expect as you are well aware, and I don\u2019t know this market works in vehicles that when they launch a platform, you will see a big change in the revenue as a function of when these new platforms launch. And so I would say that the volume does tend to be kind of chunky in the space as opposed to being linear. And once the vehicle launches and it\u2019s in the market, then you will see kind of a linear pattern of growth. But once the program first launches, you will see more of a step function change in revenue. And so between now and 2025, that business will grow. And we talked about in some of the outlook numbers that we still expect our eMobility segment to see strong growth. It\u2019s a very strong growth for 2024 in our guidance, but some of this growth will be chunky as we think about bringing on these new platforms that we have won. Nigel Coe : That\u2019s great. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Phil Buller from Berenberg. Please go ahead. Phil Buller : Hi there. Thanks for the questions. Craig, just to follow-up on some of the answers you gave to the prior questions. You talked about the megatrends existing globally, which I get, but how much of the divergence between the U.S. and elsewhere would you attribute to the current economic differences, which I think is the answer you gave to Jeff\u2019s earlier question versus how much of this is just the weighting towards data center and utilities in the U.S. being much larger than Europe, which I think is how we answered Julian\u2019s question? I guess I am wondering if there is a third part to this, which is market share. So, I don\u2019t know if you can comment on the market share changes that you see in the U.S. or Europe, please? Thanks. Craig Arnold : Yes. No. What I would tell you is that in simple terms, I would say no with respect to market share. When you take a look at our growth in our European business in any given quarter, you could find things bouncing around. But if you look at our growth on a 2-year stack or 3-year stack and you look at our revenues versus our peers, I think you would find the numbers to be quite comparable. But I would say that it is mega projects and the scale of mega projects that is driving the differences. It is where we play in, let\u2019s say, the Americas versus where we play in Europe. I talked about our penetration in Europe being a lot of which is in MOEM and industrial equipment. We don\u2019t have today as broad a portfolio in some of these other segments, call it, data center. We played very well in data centers, but we are not as big a player in data centers. We play in utilities, but we are not as big a player in the utility market. So, we just have a broader, more complete set of solutions in the Americas that are supported by these megatrends. And the other big difference is, once again, all the stimulus dollars that are being pumped into the U.S. economy that is essentially driving outside growth. And it\u2019s driving outside growth in these same verticals, reindustrialization of industrial facilities, investments in utility markets, investments in chips and the Chip Act. And so you are finding these kind of broader trends being also turbocharged by government stimulus spending. Phil Buller : Just as a follow-up to that quickly, if I may. What\u2019s your current take on the EU policies these days? Obviously, everyone was quite bullish about the Green Deal and Net Zero Industry Act a year or so ago. Do you think that they will ever lay an egg in a meaningful way like the U.S. ones do, or is that optimistic? Craig Arnold : No. I think \u2013 I mean I think in many ways even more than the U.S., I mean the European government has demonstrated their commitment to essentially moving towards a low-carbon society. And they are putting both dollars behind it and just as importantly, they are putting regulatory changes in place to drive the adoption of these green technologies, right. So \u2013 but as you can imagine, there is a lot going on in Europe today. There is a lot of challenges on a lot of different fronts in Europe that I think are today getting in the way and holding back some of the benefits that you would ultimately see in that space. And as we talk about the manufacturing segment, Europe is much more \u2013 has been much more of a manufacturing engine for the world in places like Germany. And those markets have clearly slowed dramatically. So \u2013 but where we participate, think about data centers, for example, our data center business in Europe is also up dramatically. So, where we have kind of some of these megatrends, energy transition where we play in energy transition markets, those markets are up dramatically in Europe. But the business mix is quite different. And in that case, it\u2019s being held back. Those benefits are not showing up because it\u2019s being overwhelmed by some of these other structural issues in some of the legacy businesses. Phil Buller : Got it. And finally, if I may just squeeze one very quick one in on Aerospace. There is no change to the 10% to 12% range for the year. But at the nine months, I think you are 13% and a bit and so that implies a bit of a moderation in Q4 from somewhere. So, can you talk about what\u2019s happening there, please, I assume it\u2019s defense or perhaps there is something else going on that, please? Thanks. Craig Arnold : Yes. I don\u2019t think \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t over-read that in terms of \u2013 we don\u2019t anticipate a slowdown in Aerospace. As we talked about in our prepared remarks that the orders continue to grow, backlog continues to grow, so I would not over-read an implied number for aerospace in Q4. We still are very much pleased with that market and expect to see longer term kind of growth being quite attractive there. Phil Buller : Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from Joe O\u2019Dea from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Joe O\u2019Dea: Hi. Thanks. I will keep it to one. I am interested in how you are kind of evaluating the opportunities on mega projects and the degree to which you maybe even thinking that it means win rates can\u2019t be as high as they have historically just because of the magnitude of the opportunity that\u2019s out there. And so I am sure it\u2019s inspiring some competitors to invest more in some of these verticals as well. And where are you directing your investment dollars most to maybe position yourself best for at least as good, if not higher win rates moving forward when we think about the verticals that you outlined on Slide 19, where you want your sort of exposure to those to get that much bigger over time and outpace the market? Craig Arnold : I would say that in many ways, it\u2019s quite the opposite. If you think about today where we tend to do well as a company and where our win rate tends to be higher, the bigger the project, the more complicated and sophisticated the project, the more likely it is that Eaton will win and garner higher share. So, if you think about today, the big mega projects and our win rate on a mega project versus our historical underlying market share, our win rate would be higher. It would be higher because once again, if you think about our total ability to deliver a complete solution, medium voltage, low voltage and everything in between, today, we have a much better capability than most of the companies that we are competing against in the North America market where most of these mega projects have taken place. And so yes, without a doubt, the competitive dynamic is such that it\u2019s an attractive space. I will tell you that for the most part, most companies are struggling with the same capacity constraint that we are. So today, with respect to a disruptor coming in and doing something that would somehow change the dynamics around underlying market share, highly, highly unlikely because there is simply not enough capacity to do it. And then secondly, you need the capability. And if you think about the size and the scale of these mega projects, you need a company who has pedigree, a company who you can rely upon and trust to essentially bring these projects home for you. The stuff that we do is mission-critical. And it\u2019s not the kind of place that you would tend to find companies or customers testing or trialing somebody new. Joe O\u2019Dea: Appreciate it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next question is from Brett Linzey from Mizuho. One moment please. Please go ahead with your question. Brett Linzey : Yes. Good afternoon. Thanks. Just back to the billion investment, is there any way to think about the mix of what\u2019s expense versus capitalized? And is this going to be a program you are going to provide some quarterly guidance on like you have done with some of the restructuring programs in the past? Craig Arnold : No, I would say today, we would not intend to provide any particular quarterly guidance or clarity on that, other than we can certainly let you know when the new capacity comes online, I think that\u2019s perfectly fair. But the other thing to [ph] think about is that, yes, it\u2019s a big investment. There is going to be a mix of capital and expense. That\u2019s all kind of embedded \u2013 going to be embedded in our guidance as we go forward. But as the company has gotten bigger and our denominator, revenue and everything else has gotten bigger, yes, we have historically spent about 3% of revenue in CapEx. That number may pop up to 3.5% order magnitude. But so it\u2019s not going to be \u2013 it\u2019s a big number. It\u2019s going to give us the ability to solve a lot of bottlenecks. But in the big scheme of things, you are talking about maybe 0.5 point movement in terms of our CapEx spend here. So yes, there is going to be some expense associated with it as well. But once again, all of that embedded in kind of the 30% kind of incremental numbers that we talked about for planning purposes. Brett Linzey : Got it. I will leave it there. Thanks a lot. Craig Arnold : Alright. Thank you. Yan Jin : Okay. Thanks guys. We reached to the end of the call. I appreciate everybody\u2019s questions. As always, our team will do a follow-up call with you guys if you need to have more questions. Thanks for joining us. Have a good day guys. Craig Arnold : Thank you. Tom Okray : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Teleconference service. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, your conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Yan Jin. Please go ahead. Yan Jin : Good morning. Thank you all for joining us for Eaton's fourth quarter 2023 earnings call. With me today are Craig Arnold, our Chairman and CEO; and Tom Okray, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our agenda today includes operating remarks by Craig, then I will turn it over to Tom who will highlight the company's performance in the fourth quarter. As we have done on our past calls, we'll be taking questions at end of Craig's closing commentary. The press release and the presentation we'll go through today have been posted on our website. The presentation includes adjusted earnings per share, adjusted free cash flow and other non-GAAP measures, they are reconciled in the appendix. A webcast of this call is accessible on our website and will be available for replay. I would like to remind you that our comments today will include statements related to the expected future results of the company and are therefore forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our forecasted projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and the presentation. With that, I will turn it over to Craig. Craig Arnold : Okay. Thanks, Yan. We're pleased to report our Q4 results and record performance for the year. Our team continued to deliver on our commitments, supported by strong markets and good execution. So let me begin with some highlights of the quarter on Page 3. We generated adjusted EPS of $2.55 for the quarter and $9.12 for the year, both all-time records. Adjusted EPS was up 24% and full year was up 20%. And we continued to post strong margins. Q4 was 22.8%, up 200 basis points and above the high end of our guidance. We also delivered strong incremental margins, 42% in the quarter. And we continue to see strong market activity. On a rolling 12-month basis, book-to-bill for Electrical and Aerospace was 1.1 and our backlog increased by 15% for Electrical and 13% for Aerospace. And as you've read, we're initiating guidance for 2024 and expect another year of strong organic growth, double-digit increases in adjusted EPS and continued strength in cash flow. And I'll go through the full guidance details shortly. Lastly, we're announcing a multiyear restructuring program that will eliminate fixed costs and improve our overall efficiency. The program will cost $375 million and deliver $325 million of mature year benefits. So the combination of market tailwinds, our internal growth initiatives and our continued focus on operating efficiency will allow us to deliver outstanding results for years to come. And speaking of market tailwinds, let's turn to Slide 4. In the last couple of quarters, we shared our framework while we think about key growth drivers for the company. The chart reflects the 6 secular growth trends that will positively impact our business today and for years to come. And we're stepping up our investment in R&D and capital to ensure that we're well positioned to capture this growth. We think Eaton is uniquely positioned in that most of our businesses are expected to see an acceleration in market-driven growth opportunities. In our prior 2 earnings calls, we provided a summary of progress on infrastructure spending, reindustrialization, utility and data center markets in Electrical and our Aerospace business. Today, we'll provide an update on the impact from reindustrialization and how it continues to drive a record number of mega projects in North America. We'll also provide you with a framework for how to think about the timing impact on mega projects from when a project is announced, to a negotiation, to an order and eventually, to a sale. So let's take a look at Slide 5 in the presentation. We've shared this data previously and it's a good proxy for the reindustrialization trend we're seeing. You'll recall, this summarizes the number of mega projects that we have announced since January of 2021. And a mega project, once again is a project with an announced value of $1 billion or more and there's been 333 of those through the end of last year, beginning in January 2021. Note that this is North America data but we're seeing a similar trend in Europe, although the dollars are not as large. A few points to note; first, at $933 billion, this number is 3x the normal rate and the increase translates directly into electrical markets. As a reminder, the electrical content on these projects is typically anywhere from 3% to 5%. Second, the number continues to grow and is up 9% from Q3. This will not go on forever, we're sure but there continues to be strong momentum for U.S. industrial projects and we're building a multiyear backlog. And third, about 72% of these projects are still in the planning phases and only 18% have actually started. Some 10% have been canceled or significantly delayed but this number is actually lower than historical rates. For those that have started, we've won over $1 billion in orders with a win rate of approximately 40%. And we're in active negotiations on another $1 billion of electrical content on a small subset of these total projects. So as you can see, mega projects are a compelling reason to be optimistic about the future. Turning to Slide 6; we want to highlight the timing and the duration of these mega projects as they become opportunities for our electrical business. The primary conclusion is we've not seen a significant impact from the large step-up in the number or size of mega projects yet but it's coming. While each project is different, we put together our view of 3 representative examples of reindustrialization projects, including a semiconductor, an EV battery and a health care example. This slide indicates the number of months between an announcement of a mega project and the time we begin to negotiate it, the time from an announcement of an order -- the time from an announcement to an order and from an announcement to a shipment. As you can see, it takes on average 3 to 5 years from when a project is announced to when it shows up in our revenue. So while the gratification is certainly delayed, this is what's showing up in our backlog and providing outstanding visibility to future growth. With over $1 billion of orders that we've already won, we expect revenues to be recognized over the next several years in line with each of these products' individual time lines. And just as a point of reference, our revenues in Electrical America for mega projects in 2023 was only about 3% of our total revenues. By contrast, they represent 16% of our negotiations and 6% of our orders. Hence, the conclusion that most of the impact from the significant step-up in mega projects is still ahead of us. And now let me just turn it over to Tom. But before I do, I do want to take this opportunity to thank Tom. I mean Tom has just been an outstanding leader for Eaton in his tenure with us and I couldn't have asked for a better partner or a more effective CFO. And Tom, we're absolutely disappointed to see you go, we fully understand the reason you made this decision. We wish you all the best of luck and thanks once again for this outstanding leadership over the last 3 years. Tom Okray : Thanks, Craig. I'll start by reviewing how our fiscal year 2023 results compared to our original guidance. Throughout the year, we demonstrated the ability to execute on our commitments and raise guidance for all key metrics. We've delivered our third consecutive year of double-digit organic growth with a 20% increase in adjusted EPS, all-time record margins and a 48% increase in free cash flow. A particular note, organic growth and segment margins were up versus the original guidance, 400 and 110 basis points, respectively. Further, adjusted EPS and free cash flow grew 11% and 4%, respectively, versus the original guide. On the next chart, we have a summary of our quarterly results which includes several records. With respect to the top line, we posted an all-time sales record of $6 billion, up 11%. Organic growth continues to be strong, up 10% for the quarter. We have generated double-digit organic growth in 7 of the last 8 quarters, with the last 7 quarters growing over 20% on a 2-year stack. We posted operating profit Q4 records on both a margin and absolute basis. Operating profit grew 22% and segment margin expanded 200 basis points to 22.8%. Incremental margin was very strong at 42%. Adjusted EPS of $2.55 increased by 24% over the prior year. This is an all-time record and above the high end of our guidance range. This performance resulted in all-time quarterly operating and free cash flow records. Our $1.3 billion of operating cash flow was 9% higher than the prior year, generating 18% free cash flow margin and 103% free cash flow conversion. For the full year, we also set numerous records, including record sales, segment margins, adjusted EPS and earnings and operating and free cash flow. On Slide 9, we detail our Electrical Americas results. The Electrical Americas business continues to execute very well and delivered another very strong quarter. We set an all-time record for sales, operating profit and margins. Organic sales growth remained strong at 16% with broad-based growth in nearly all end markets. On a 2-year stack, organic growth is up 36%. Electrical Americas has generated double-digit organic growth for 8 consecutive quarters. All-time record operating margin of 28.5% was up versus prior year 480 basis points, benefiting primarily from higher volumes, effective management of price cost and improved manufacturing efficiency. Incremental margin was 58% for the segment. On a rolling 12-month basis, orders were down 4%. However, it's important to note that the dollar value of the orders remains high and the decline needs to be viewed in the context of the 34% order growth in Q4 of last year. As discussed in prior earnings calls, order intake is an important metric that needs to be analyzed together with record backlog. Currently, in our electrical sector, we have backlog coverage of almost 3x our historical average. We've looked at multiple scenarios with meaningful order intake decline and are confident in those scenarios, given our backlog coverage that we can generate robust organic growth for several quarters, well into 2025. More specifically, Electrical Americas backlog increased 18% year-over-year and was also up sequentially, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.2 on a rolling 12-month basis. For orders, we had particular strength in data center, MOEM and institutional markets. Also, our major project negotiations pipeline in Q4 was up 55% versus prior year and up 189% since Q4 2021. On a full year basis, Electrical Americas posted 19% organic growth with 26.5% margins, up 400 basis points over prior year. Electrical Americas posted records for full year sales, along with profit on both a margin and absolute basis. With the tailwinds from secular trends, strong execution and robust backlog, Electrical Americas is well positioned as we enter 2024. The next chart summarizes our results for the Electrical Global segment. Leveraging Q4 record revenue, organic growth increased to 4% from flat in Q3. We have strengthened data center, industrial and commercial and institutional markets. Operating margin of 18.8% was up 10% versus the prior year. Orders were up 1% on a rolling 12-month basis, with strength in data center and IT, utility, MOEM and industrial markets. Importantly, book-to-bill continues to remain greater than 1. On a full year basis, Electrical Global posted 5% organic growth and 19.3% margins. The business posted records for both full year sales and operating profit. Before moving to our Industrial businesses, I'd like to briefly recap the combined Electrical segments. For Q4, we posted organic growth of 11%, incremental margin of 51% and segment margin of 25% which was up 320 basis points over prior year. On a rolling 12-month basis, our book-to-bill ratio for our Electrical sector remains very strong, above 1.1. We remain quite confident in our positioning for continued growth with strong margins in our overall electrical business. Chart 11 highlights our Aerospace segment. We posted an all-time quarterly sales and Q4 operating profit record. Organic growth was 8% for the quarter, with a 2% contribution from foreign exchange. Growth was driven by broad strength across all markets, with particular strength in defense aftermarket, in both commercial OEM and commercial aftermarket which were up 26%, 25% and 18%, respectively. Operating margin of 22.4% was down 210 basis points on a year-over-year basis, benefiting from higher volumes and effective management of price cost offset by unfavorable mix and favorable defense programs in the prior year. On a rolling 12-month basis, orders increased 7% and with especially strong growth in commercial and defense aftermarket and commercial OEM. Year-over-year backlog increased 13% and was up 3% sequentially. On a rolling 12-month basis, our book-to-bill for our Aerospace segment remained strong at 1.1. Moving on to our Vehicle segment on Page 12. In the quarter, total revenue was up 2%, all from favorable foreign exchange. Vehicle end markets were down 500 basis points year-over-year but the business was able to deliver outgrowth, primarily driven by higher aftermarket sales, stronger share in heavy-duty transmissions and a new product launch of electrical vehicle gearing in China. Operating margin came in at 17.9%, 270 basis points above prior year, driven by effective management of price cost and improvement in manufacturing efficiency. Throughout 2023, we've demonstrated the ability to execute on operational improvements as shown by our 270 basis point improvement in segment margins from the first half to the second half of the year. On Page 13, we show results for our eMobility business. We generated another quarter of strong growth, including an all-time sales record. Revenue was up 19%, 18% organically and 1% from favorable foreign exchange. Driven by the ramp-up of new product launches, we outpaced the market which grew 7%. However, due to program start-up costs, the operating loss increased by $14 million when compared to the prior year. On a full year basis, eMobility posted 18% organic growth on slightly lower margins as we continue to invest in the business. We remain very encouraged by the profitable growth prospects of the eMobility segment. In 2023, we won new programs with more than $1 billion of mature year revenues. Through these wins, we continue to find opportunities to leverage expertise and differentiated technologies across segments. Moving to Page 14. We show our Electrical and Aerospace backlog updated through Q4. As you can see, we continue to build backlog with Electrical stepping up to $9.5 billion and Aerospace reaching $3.2 billion for a total backlog of $12.7 billion. Both businesses have increased their backlogs by significantly more than 100% since Q4 2020, with Electrical growing almost 200%. Versus prior year, our backlogs have grown by 15% in Electrical and 13% in Aerospace which exceeded our expectations as we began the year. As noted earlier, both Electrical and Aerospace have book-to-bill ratios above 1.1. Our strong backlog to close the year gives us continued confidence in our growth outlook for 2024 and beyond. In addition to our strong backlog growth in 2023, the next page shows the acceleration in growth of our negotiations pipeline which supports our expectation for stronger markets and structurally higher organic growth rate. In Electrical Americas, the pipeline doubled over the past 3 years and increased a further 29% and in 2023. This is even stronger than the 19% organic growth in our Electrical Americas business which suggests continued strength going forward. For 2023, we saw $6.2 billion of projects in our negotiations pipeline in Electrical Americas alone. Now, I'll pass it back to Craig to walk through the guidance and wrap up the presentation. Craig Arnold : Thanks, Tom. Turning to Page 16, we lay out our end market assumptions for 2024. You'll recall that we provided an early look at our 2024 assumptions during our Q3 earnings call at the end of October. Today, we're updating those assumptions. And with the exception of residential markets where we have increased our outlook from down slightly to flat in commercial vehicles where we have decreased our outlook from slightly declining to declining, all of our assumptions have remained the same. In contrast to what we're seeing in the macro economy, we continue to expect growth in about 80% of our end markets. And much of this growth is supported by large backlogs. Turning to Page 17. As you've read, we're announcing a new multiyear restructuring program to reduce fixed costs and enhance our efficiency. While we're structurally positioned to deliver higher levels of organic growth, we also have a vast number of opportunities to improve the way we run the company. And we're at a point in time where we have the organizational capacity to take on a number of these efficiency projects that have been in our pipeline for some time. The program will focus on reducing structural costs through the consolidation of rooftops, increasing shared services and deploying digital technologies. These actions will also free up time and resources in our businesses, allowing them to focus on growth and driving operational improvements. Overall, we expect $375 million of restructuring costs over the next 3 years with $325 million of mature year savings in 2027. This includes approximately $175 million of charges in 2024 and $50 million of savings, both of which are included in our 2024 guide and I'll cover those in the next several slides. While the company is performing well, we see these actions as an important part of how we'll continue to do so for years to come. Moving to Page 18. We summarize our 2024 revenue and margin guidance. Our organic growth for 2024 is expected to be between 6.5% and 8.5%, with particular strength in Electrical Americas and Aerospace, both expected to be up between 9% and 11% while eMobility is expected to grow some 30% as new programs are launched and the electric vehicle market continues to see solid growth. And I'd also add that the healthy end markets, combined with our large backlog provides actually better-than-normal visibility for our 2024 outlook. For segment margins, our guidance range of 22.4% to 22.8% is an improvement of 60 basis points at the midpoint from our 2023 all-time record of 22%. As we've communicated earlier, incremental margins of about 30% are what you should assume and that's what's reflected in our guidance. These incrementals are consistent with our plan to step up investments in R&D and with the investments we're making to expand our manufacturing capacity, all done to ensure future growth. On the next page, we have the balance of our guidance for 2024 and Q1. For 2024, our adjusted EPS is expected to be between $9.95 and $10.35 a share, $10.15 at the midpoint and up some 11% from 2023. And for operating cash flow, our guidance is between $4 billion and $4.4 billion, up 17% at the midpoint. The key drivers here are really a combination of higher earnings and improved working capital. We also expect to repurchase between $1.5 billion and $2.5 billion of our shares outstanding. And given our cash position at the end of the year, at the end of '23 and our strong cash generation this year, we'll still have plenty of room for strategic M&A. For Q1, we expect organic growth to be between 6% and 8%, segment margins between 21.3% and 21.7% and adjusted EPS in the range of $2.21 and $2.31 per share. Let me just close here on Page 20. As we transition into 2024, I think we can all conclude that Eaton has proven that we're a changed company, a company that delivers higher growth, higher earnings and does so consistently. And we're proud of our team's record performance in 2023. But once again, we see opportunities to be better everywhere. As we look forward, we continue to experience powerful megatrends that are driving higher growth in our end markets and we're investing to ensure that we're capturing these opportunities while gaining market share. We're also continuing to optimize the way we run the company, improving our operational execution, leveraging our scale and reducing our fixed costs. This is allowing us to invest like never before in R&D, in capacity expansion and in our people. So our expectations are high and our teams are looking forward to delivering another exceptional year. So with that, I'll open things up for any questions that you may have. Yan Jin : Thanks, Craig. [Operator Instructions] With that, I will turn it over to the operator to give you guys the operation. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Then now this question will come from the line of Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research. Jeff Sprague : Good luck, Tom. Craig, first question for me is just on the restructuring itself. We tend to think of these things being kind of contracyclical, right? Demand is weak. We're in a recession, we do a heavy restructuring. It seems, I don't know, odd or a little risky maybe to undertake a big move like this with such a strong demand pull through both the Electrical and Aero businesses. So can you maybe just address the risk mitigation and how you manage kind of maybe the capacity through this? I assume you're also trying to increase capacity while you restructure but love some additional thoughts on that. Craig Arnold : Jeff. Appreciate the question. And -- I'm not sure for everybody else but I'm getting a little background noise on the call. I'm not sure -- okay, that's better. Jeff, we spent a lot of time as a company sorting this one out in terms of whether or not it made sense to take on these restructuring projects at this time. Because, to your point, things are going very well and we have perhaps more growth opportunities than we've ever had in the history of the company. But at the same time, we actually have more capacity today than we've had in a long time. As you'll certainly be aware, we haven't done many acquisitions over the last couple of years. In fact, we really haven't done any. And so we actually have more bandwidth as an organization today to take on these projects. And one of the things that we do as a company is that we always have a forward view of our opportunities to be better, to improve efficiencies, to eliminate redundancies, to build scale, to essentially leverage some of these new technologies that are coming forth. And so we, today, as an organization, as a leadership team, all agree with that. There's probably no better time than right now to take on these projects, to improve our cost position and really set the company up for margin expansion for the next 3 years on top of the growth that we're going to see as a business. So lots of confidence today in our ability to take it on and we have plenty of capacity as an organization to do so. Tom Okray : And what I would just add, Jeff, is add -- I think it would actually be riskier if we didn't do it. Because the foundation of the restructuring program is simplification as well an elimination of waste which frees up human resource time to focus on the shift that we've been making into growth. So it actually would be riskier if we didn't do it and it's great to lean forward and execute it at a time of strength. Craig Arnold : Yes. That's a great point. I said that in my outbound commentary, this notion that essentially, we're freeing up time in our operations so that they can focus on growth and improving our operational execution, while some of our corporate teams take on a number of these support services. So you're absolutely right, Tom. Thanks for that amplification. Jeff Sprague : Yes. And just a follow-up -- the background noise might be me, I'm dialing through my computer here, juggling multiple phone calls and different cell phones going on; a crazy day here. Unrelated question, just on backlog. Obviously, it does provide a lot of visibility and comfort. But we've seen a couple of companies with big backlogs also have sales disappointments, because the backlog is big but it's not fungible, right? Air pockets develop here and there. Maybe just kind of address that risk. Do you kind of see anything that you need to kind of navigate through from a timing standpoint, particularly given the way you illustrated the long kind of order conversion cycle on some of those project stuff that's in the backlog? Craig Arnold : Yes, no, I appreciate that question, Jeff and understand the nature of it. But I can just tell you, based upon at least what we're seeing and the nature of our backlog today and as I'm sure you're well aware of that, we, as Eaton and really, quite frankly, as an industry, we've had more demand than we've had capacity largely over the last couple of years. And so we think we have plenty of ability to accelerate, decelerate if necessary, backlog conversion to essentially keep the top line growing at an attractive rate in the event that you have some sort of order that would be moving in or out or some sort of lack of linearity in the order book itself. And so not a concern; we've not seen it to date. As we look at kind of the stratification of the backlog and when orders are due, we don't have that concern. Operator : And the next question is from Andrew Obin from Bank of America. Andrew Obin : Seems like you guys are doing great, yes. Just a different way of asking, I guess, Jeff's question. Can you just talk -- you mentioned capacity additions. Can you just -- and I appreciate that some of this is competitive. But what areas are you adding capacity? When will this capacity be available to really move the needle? And -- yes and anything you're doing differently on geographies post the whole COVID experience? Craig Arnold : Yes, no. Appreciate the question, Andrew. And one of the things we tried to do in the last earnings call is add a little bit of color around this $1 billion of investment that we're putting in as a company to support growth. And I would tell you, it's really pretty broad-based. We talked about investments that we're making to support growth in utilities, in transformers, in both regulators and our line insulation and protection equipment. We talked about, obviously, the huge growth that we're seeing in data centers and growth in institutional markets and the investments that we're making there in low and medium voltage assemblies and fitboards and panel boards. We've had to make investments in our core component circle breaker capacity. And obviously, we're making big investments in eMobility as well. So I think it's actually fairly broad-based with respect to the product lines. As it relates to the geography, we're clearly seeing much bigger investments, much faster growth in the Americas and that's really where the -- principally a lot of these big investments have gone. But we -- to your question about timing, what we're assuming in terms of our own capacity, industry capacity is another issue as we work through suppliers and some of the others in the value chain. But we think a lot of this capacity for us begins to phase in this year. And so sometime between, let's say, the second quarter and the end of the year when we'll have most of our investments done -- and it certainly gives us the capacity to do more, assuming there aren't other bottlenecks and restrictions, whether it be labor or others in the value chain. Andrew Obin : Got you. And then just a follow-up, I guess, naturally builds on the first answer. In terms of your supply chain, what are the biggest challenges are you still experiencing? And what has gotten better over the past 3, 6 months? And what's still a problem? Craig Arnold : Yes. What I would tell you, in many ways Andrew, we're really back to where we've been historically and we've never lived in a world where we didn't have the intermittent supply chain issues. So I would say, by and large, we've seen fairly significant progress every place. It used to be that electronics were a major bottleneck and issue. Most of those issues are now behind us. We still have pockets of individual challenges in various suppliers with various components. But I would say today, it is really more episodic and unique than it is, I'd say, a pattern or a broader, let's say, capacity constraint in a particular commodity. And so we, like in our own investments, we've been working hard to build capacity internally. We've also been working with our suppliers, giving them lead time and visibility into our growth over the next multiple years to ensure that they, too, are making investments in capacity to keep up with our demand. And so I would say today, it's largely the episodic issue as opposed to a systemic issue. Tom Okray : Just to jump in Andrew, on the last point. I think that's really been key, partnering with the suppliers so we can grow together with them. And we've gotten much more efficient, probably as a result of the pandemic, understanding what we need on a go-forward demand basis. Andrew Obin : Tom, you'll be missed and congratulations. Operator : Our next question is from Chris Snyder from UBS. Chris Snyder : So obviously, mega projects have become a big driver of the Eaton story and an important driver of the outlook, so I appreciate all the information you guys provided there. But if we step back and look -- and even look through the low single-digit mega project tailwind in 2023, I think you said it was 3% of total of Americas revenue, organic growth has still grown at a double-digit rate for the last 8 quarters. Can you just talk about why underlying demand has been so strong? Because I think when most investors see the huge growth numbers, everyone just assumes it's the mega project opportunity already playing out. Craig Arnold : No, I appreciate the question. And I think I'd say long before we were talking about mega projects, we were talking about secular growth drivers, we were talking about energy transition, we were talking about the electrification of the economy. We were talking about digitalization. You think about -- today, mega projects deal with these big projects above $1 billion announcements but we've seen very similar growth in projects that are well below the $1 billion threshold until reindustrialization of the U.S. and other markets where today, you have production moving back in and big investments taking place. And so the trends are much broader than mega projects. The reason we've put this emphasis on mega projects is because it's a great indicator of the multiyear runway that we have and a chance to give the investor community visibility into the outlook over multiple years. But you're absolutely right. We're seeing broad-based growth in our business much beyond this mega project emphasis but the mega projects will become a bigger piece of our future. That's why we talked about 3% of sales, 6% of orders, 16% of negotiations, that continues to be a tailwind, a real impetus for future growth. Tom Okray : Yes. And Chris, if I could just throw in on that. We talked about in the prepared remarks at a high level, our major projects, our large project negotiations and that's much less than these mega projects. And just some of the numbers, if you look at year-over-year for data centers growing over 160% in terms of negotiation volume; institutions over 40%; government and health care over, 30%. So it's really, really broad-based, as Craig says. The mega projects, if you like, just really put the cherry on top and give us just a long runway going forward. Chris Snyder : Yes, no, absolutely. I appreciate the durability and sustainability that it brings. And then just kind of on that same topic, my back-of-the-envelope math suggests that this ramp in mega projects at least drives about a $25 billion incremental market opportunity over the next few years. So a pretty massive ramp for an industry that is already having trouble keeping up with demand. So I guess the question is, do you see a pathway forward for the industry to meet this demand? And how does that impact your multiyear expectations for our ability to push price and drive margins higher? Craig Arnold : Yes. I think your back-of-the-envelope math is pretty good, actually. It does create a very large growth opportunity for the electrical industry. And I would say to this question around whether or not the industry is going to have enough capacity and bandwidth to capture all of these opportunities, I think one of the restrictions today on growth in general is the fact that there is not enough capacity in the industry which is why we're making fairly sizable investments in our own manufacturing facilities and working with our suppliers to do the same, so that we can try to get out some of this demand and continue to grow the company. And then on top of that, perhaps the greatest limiter on growth may be the labor constraint in terms of finding enough skilled trades people to deal with the significant backlog of demand. And so what we think fundamentally is going to happen is that the growth will be there but the cycle will be extended because we simply will not have enough capacity and labor to deal with all the demand and the time frame in which is requested. And so the cycle will simply be expanded out multiple years beyond where it normally would reside. Operator : The next question is from the line of Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. Steve Tusa : Tom, congrats on going out with a bang here. Great, great results. Just the pricing dynamics, what are you guys assuming for -- in your electrical businesses for price roughly in '24 embedded in your guidance? Craig Arnold : Yes, Steve, as you probably are aware, we don't provide specific price guidance. We don't separate price and volume. I will tell you that on a relative basis, when you compare, let's say, 2024 and 2023, 2022, the price will contribute a much smaller piece of our growth than volume will. And that's -- so we're going to be probably back to more of a historical level of price realization in terms of 2024. And that's really a function of the fact that we're not seeing inflation. We had to essentially work the price lever fairly significantly over the last couple of years as we dealt with this inflation that was in the system. Now we still have some inflation principally on the labor side. So we will still get price but its contributions to our growth will be significantly less than it had been in prior years. Steve Tusa : Right. And I guess just on the cash flow statement, I think like -- I'm not sure if I'm seeing this right but $2 billion of share repo in '24. I mean I think that's a pretty decent-sized number. Anything going on specifically there? Craig Arnold : $2 billion at the midpoint -- okay, go ahead, Tom. Tom Okray : Yes, no, we finished 2023 with $2.6 billion in cash. And given how we're guiding and given how we are doing a better job of managing working capital, given the supply chain constraints are going away, we're going to have a very good year of generating cash in 2024. So we go to our capital allocation tenants and we're very clear, we're not going to collect cash on the balance sheet. So at the midpoint, we've got $2 billion. As was said in the prepared remarks, though, this gives us plenty of dry powder to do strategic M&A., so even with that $2 billion. And the final thing I would end with is our net leverage on the balance sheet which you probably know, Steve, is 1.3. So we've got a very strong balance sheet, just a ton of flexibility from a capital allocation perspective. Steve Tusa : Right. So it's a 2% lift from share count in general embedded in the guidance for EPS growth-ish? Tom Okray : Relatively minor, a couple of pennies versus consensus, yes. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Joe Ritchie : So I think Chris kind of touched on this in his question but maybe to ask it more explicitly. As you think about that first $1 billion plus in mega projects that you've won, just what's the margin profile of those wins and how we should be thinking about that ultimately materializing in the P&L? Craig Arnold : Yes. I would say that the margin profile on these mega projects is not going to be terribly different than the margin profile in the underlying business. It's -- these -- we are in a position, as you can imagine, when your capacity constraint to be selective around where you win. And so we would not expect -- even though they're big projects and oftentimes you find a large project, margins take a bit of a haircut, we should -- you should not expect that as these mega projects translate into revenue. Joe Ritchie : Got it. That's great to hear, Craig. And then I guess, look, the funnel keeps on growing now for the last couple of quarters at a pretty material rate. There's a lot of concern with the election coming that perhaps this first wave of projects that have broken ground continues but maybe you get a stall on the second -- in the second wave. Just any thoughts around that? I know you kind of touched on the potential for labor constraints but I'm really more -- any other thoughts that you would have on just continuing to grow the funnel and then making sure that, that actually -- we'll actually see that ultimately in your outlook? Craig Arnold : Yes, no, I appreciate the question and the concern. I mean given the upcoming elections and in many ways, it's kind of an unknowable in terms of how the election is going to turn out. And then, quite frankly, even with the change in the administration, difficult to know what position they will take with respect to a lot of the stimulus spending that is essentially underlying and supporting these mega projects. And I will tell you, what gives us a fairly high level of confidence that it's not going to change materially, is that a lot of these projects are going into red states. And so despite what may happen kind of on the political front, the benefactor of a lot of these projects are actually those red states. And it's walk to wait and see how it all plays. And we don't think today it's going to have a material impact. Today, we are looking at more demand and we have capacity to serve. So even if there was a little bit of a give back, the business is still in great shape and to support the long-term growth assumptions for the company. But in many ways, it's kind of the unknowable. We just don't know how the election is going to unfold and then what happens afterwards. Operator : The next question is from Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Julian Mitchell : Thanks a lot, Tom, for all the help. Maybe just a first question would be around, when you think about sort of the mega projects and the impact on North America orders, so you've had a sort of a book-to-bill well over 1x in 2023 even with those trading 12-month orders being down somewhat off the high base. When you look at 2024, is it sort of a similar construct where I suppose you could have orders down but the book-to-bill still over 1x just because of the capacity constraints? And then more broadly, any concerns that you and your peers collectively are adding maybe too much capacity in electrical output? Craig Arnold : Yes, no, appreciate the question, Julian. And it's certainly -- it's one of the things that we spend a lot of time thinking about as well in terms of what will the tenor of 2024 would look like. But I think the short answer to the question is, yes. I mean it's very much possible that you could continue to see a moderation of orders and a book-to-bill and a total backlog that doesn't change. In fact, when we came into 2023, we actually expected to be able to eat into the backlog and the backlog grew by some 15%. And so the industry continues to be constrained. And obviously -- but for industry constraints, we would post bigger growth numbers than we provided in the guidance. The demand is there to grow faster than 7.5% that we've talked about as the midpoint of our guidance. So that absolutely is possible that you could essentially -- orders could moderate in your backlog to continue to be record highs or continue to grow. Tom Okray : Yes. And just to add a little bit more color to that. And Julian, we talked about this in previous calls and tried to put it in the prepared remarks but I think it's very important for everyone on the call. We have modeled year-over-year order decline, meaningful order decline. And in those scenarios, given our backlog coverage, as we said in the prepared remarks, we are able to have robust organic growth well into 2025. So that gives us great confidence that even if year-over-year orders continue to decline in a meaningful way, we've still got a good runway. Julian Mitchell : That's helpful. And then just a quick follow-up. Maybe switching to eMobility. You had raised that medium-term revenue guide a few months back. The noise or the news in the EV world is sort of very, very uneven. So maybe just sort of tell us how you see it for the growth rates of that business. We can see a very high growth rate dialed in for eMobility this year. Maybe just any sort of perspectives on that and maybe how you're outperforming the industry. Craig Arnold : Yes. Appreciate the question, Julian. And as you know, as we talked on our guidance, we're anticipating 30% growth in our eMobility business. And I can tell you that 30% number is today dialed back from what our customers are asking us for. We do recognize that the industry itself has gone through a little bit of a, I'd say, a wake-up call with respect to the underlying demand for EVs. By the way, still great demand, still good growth. Some 20%, I think, in the fourth quarter for us. But overall, a slower rate of growth than perhaps what people were anticipating maybe 12 months ago. So we think the industry will continue to grow and grow nicely. And what we try to do as we build our own plans and our guidance is to make sure we're appropriately hedged back to ensure that we're able to deliver our commitments. But at the same time, we have the flexibility to respond in the event that some of these customer forecasts and their outlooks are actually -- they actually come to fruition. So yes, we took about $1.5 billion, 11% return on sales. We are absolutely still -- see line of sight and committed to those goals and our forecasts have not changed. Tom Okray : Yes. And just one other thing I would add, Julian and taking you back to the prepared remarks. In eMobility, the market grew 7%, we grew 18%. So we're winning some good business there. Craig Arnold : Yes. And to your point, Tom, it really is. And I think this was maybe your question, Julian, as well. It really is platform-specific. And our growth really comes from the launching of new eMobility platforms that we have content on. And that's why our growth, we think will clearly be well above the industry's growth rate. Operator : Our next question comes from Steve Volkmann from Jefferies. Steve Volkmann : Great. I want to go back to the cost-cutting program. The $325 million of benefits in 2027, should we think of that as kind of net in terms of the margin? Or will you have some increased investments that offset some of that? Craig Arnold : No, I mean the way we talk about it, we're going to spend $375 million of restructuring to deliver $325 million of mature year benefits. And that is the way you should think about it. We'll spend those restructuring dollars over the next few years. And we had embedded as we talked about, in our 2024 guidance, $175 million of spending and $50 million of benefits but those benefits will fall through to the bottom line with -- offsetting expenses. Tom Okray : Yes. And I was just going to say and the cash associated with it is in our cash guidance as well. Steve Volkmann : Understood. So my guess is it's probably a little more Europe-centric since these things tend to be but any guidance on sort of where we'll see these results most? Craig Arnold : Yes, no, I appreciate the question. I think you can just think about it, it's going to be pretty widespread. And you can think about the total kind of allocation of the benefits being pretty much aligned with the company, 2/3 will be in Electrical, 1/3 will be in Industrial. We'll be focused on taking out rooftops in the company, driving some shared services, leveraging digital. But a lot of these benefits will really cut across the company. Tom Okray : And what I would also say is you've described it as cost cutting and there is an element of that. But I really want to come back to it's a smarter way of doing business as well. I mean we've got a number of sites. We're a very complex organization with 5 reportable segments. And we've got opportunities with our central functions to be more efficient and take work off of the business units and allow opportunity cost for leveraging resources, leveraging talent, leveraging capital as well. So there's -- it's not just pure cost cutting. It's a smarter, more efficient way of doing business as well. Craig Arnold : And it's the way we help fund the growth, right? It's the way we're funding increases in investments, in R&D and other things that we need to do to grow the company. Operator : The next question is from Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research. Nigel Coe : Sorry about. Mute button problems. So to cover a little ground but coming back to this capacity issue -- or capacity expansions. I mean the 9% to 11% growth in the Americas, Craig, I mean, it feels like given the backlog builds, obviously, orders continue to enter there, it feels like that could be relatively conservative. So just wondering if there's any kind of capacity constraints that are gating that growth forecast? And are you assuming there's going to be some backlog burn or conversion as we go through the year? Any sense there? Craig Arnold : Yes, no. And I think I had mentioned also in my commentary, Nigel, that there's certainly enough demand in the marketplace to post higher growth than we're reflecting in our guidance. And we're making investments to eliminate capacity bottlenecks. And we think by the time we get to the end of the year, we'll be in great shape. But as you know, we're participating in an industry where you have a lot of players in the value chain where you have fairly sizable labor constraints around skilled trades. And so I do think it's going to be a governor on growth based upon these factors that prevents us and the industry from growing much faster than that. You think about this 9% to 11%, this is on top of some 30% plus growth over the last 2 years. And so I would say that today, we'll see what happens with in terms of the backlog growth and how much the backlog we can burn or can't. Once again, difficult to really say, there's a lot of variables in that. Once again, we thought we were going to burn backlog in 2023 and we actually increased it, right, some 15%. So the market continues to perform even better than what we imagined. But there are very real capacity constraints in the industry that we think become the governor around this 9% to 11% growth in our Electrical business in the Americas. Nigel Coe : Yes, yes. I appreciate that. And then it just feels like data center is the -- obviously, that's probably going to be your strongest growth vertical in '24. And I think you mentioned negotiations up 160% off a pretty high base. So just thinking about capacity in that single end market. I mean is that a concern? And does the $1 billion you put in [ph], does that cover the kind of growth that we should see coming through in '24, '25 then? Craig Arnold : Yes, no, data centers will certainly be a very strong growth market for us in 2024 as well into 2025. We talked about in terms of our own forecast for the industry; we said the data center market, we think, grows at a compound growth rate of some 16% over the next 5 years or so. And that is certainly more than supported by orders. We grew from 20% in Q4. We -- in revenue, orders in the rolling 12 were up 30%. Negotiations were a lot more than that. So we continue to see just an acceleration in the data center market in terms of rate of growth. And once again, because this industry, too, is capacity constrained, is labor constrained, we think which ultimately ended up happening, is the -- as a growth cycle, that just extends or could be for a decade at very attractive growth levels. Nigel Coe : Yes, exactly. That's a long time. And '24, do you think '24 will be in that 20% there or even better? Craig Arnold : Yes. I mean we'll see. We're not providing guidance per se for individual end markets today but you can certainly assume that within that 9% to 11%, that our assumption for data centers is going to be on the higher end of that. Tom Okray : Yes. Just to add, the chart for the end markets, we have data centers and distributed IT growing strong double digit. So -- and everything from an order perspective, as Craig said, points to very robust growth in 2024. Nigel Coe : Yes, it's vertical. Thanks, Tom and congratulations. Operator : The next question is from Tim Thein from Citigroup. Timothy Thein : Yes, great. I'll just fire one in here. But I guess, to start, after spending some time with Mike Yelton, I guess, it was around this time last year, I guess, I can better understand why it was such a good move. But just on the -- on the mix in Electrical, I would guess just given the strength in these big projects that there has been a trend, I guess, as Americas comment. But you've seen kind of this continued shift from more of the growth coming from systems versus products. How do you -- in years' past, there's been times when that's given you challenges in terms of kind of managing the profitability of that. But I guess, maybe your outlook in terms of that mix dynamic in '24 and again, your confidence in terms of managing to the extent that continues, more of the growth coming from systems relative to products? Craig Arnold : Yes. And I appreciate the question. I know we kind of created this monster a little bit but we're trying to get the investor community to move away from this systems versus product distinction. Because practically speaking, they're all connected. So any time you sell an electrical system, it encompasses all of our products and components. And so for us, we really think about the right way to think about the company is to really take a look at the end markets that we laid out. We have data centers, utilities, industrial facilities, commercial facilities and that will be perhaps the most informative way to think about the company in the context of where growth is going. And I can just tell you; in general, from a profitability standpoint today, there is not a significant difference today between the profitability of systems and the components that go into the system. So now there was a time inside the company back when, let's say, we were -- in the lighting business, for example. And lighting was considered a products business. It was a relatively large business with relatively lower margins than the rest of electrical. And it was a meaningful different perhaps held back by lighting that drove different profitability between the two. But today, we don't have a significant difference in profitability. And we really think the right way to think about the company is really the function of these end markets that we've laid out once again on Slide 16... Timothy Thein : Got it. Okay. Yes, yes, for sure. And real quick, Craig, on the Arrow piece within commercial, is there -- do you expect much difference in terms of the growth between OEM and aftermarket in '24? Or are those both similar projected growth rates? Craig Arnold : Yes, no and it's an important question because, as you know, there is a very different profit profile in OE order versus an aftermarket order. Both will grow nicely in 2024. We do expect OE to grow slightly faster than aftermarket which holds margins back a little bit which is going to be reflected in our guidance. But we expect to see very strong growth in both commercial as well as the aftermarket piece of the business, the commercial OE and aftermarket. Operator : And our next question is from Deane Dray from RBC Capital Markets. Deane Dray : And congrats, Tom, best of luck. And for -- I don't know if you can parse this out but is there any way you can frame your expectations on North America Electrical of what would be going through distribution versus direct ship? I'm not sure how precise you can get there but any color would be helpful. Craig Arnold : Yes. I would say, Deane, that in North America specifically, a lot of what we do goes through distribution. And that number, order of magnitude, I think, is about 70% or so; so it's a fairly sizable piece. And as these mega projects continue to grow, as perhaps data centers, hyperscalers continue to grow, some of that tends to be perhaps more direct by virtue of the nature. But a lot of our business today those through distribution and our distributors are just -- I'd say -- I've always said, they're perhaps our greatest asset. We are committed to distribution. They add tremendous value. We have a very strong distribution network. So yes, it's one of the real assets of the company. Deane Dray : Great. And I don't think I heard the word destocking come up at all today. So -- and it did create a chuckle there. But is there any destocking, any pockets of it? You all seem to have steered clear of any of that over the past 4 months or 4 quarters but just any color there would be helpful. Craig Arnold : We did talk about a little bit of destocking that we saw in our European business which, quite frankly, really began at the beginning of 2023. We started to see destocking in Europe specifically. Fortunately, the good news is that we're beyond that. But in the Americas business, specifically, other than the odd balls and pockets of places, we've not really seen destocking in the Americas. And that's largely because these markets, as we talked about, continue to grow pretty dramatically. But we did have a little bit of it in Europe but it's fortunately behind us now. Operator : Thank you. And at this time, there are no further questions in queue. Mr. Jin, please go ahead with closing remarks. Yan Jin : Okay. Thanks, guys. I know it's a busy day and we do appreciate everybody's questions. As always, the IR team is available to address your follow-up calls. Have a good day. Thanks for joining us. Bye. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T teleconference. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Yan Jin. Please go ahead. Yan Jin : Good morning. Thank you all for joining us for Eaton's Fourth Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. With me today are Craig Arnold, our Chairman and CEO; and Olivier Leonetti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our agenda today includes the opening remarks by Craig, then he will turn it over to Olivier, who will highlight the company's performance in the fourth quarter. As we have done on our past calls, we'll be taking questions at the end of Craig's closing commentary. The press release and the presentation we'll go through today have been posted on our website. This presentation includes adjusted earnings per share, adjusted free cash flow and other non-GAAP measures. They are all reconciled in the appendix. A webcast of this call is accessible on our website and will be available for replay. I would like to remind you that our comments today will include the statements related to the expected future results of the company and are therefore forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our forecasted projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described into our earnings release and the presentation. With that, I will turn it over to Craig. Craig Arnold : Okay. Thanks, Yan. And we'll start with some highlights on Page 3, and I'll lead off by noting that we've delivered another strong quarter this year. Our adjusted EPS was $2.40 in the quarter, well above our guidance range, our record for the quarter and up 28% from prior year. I'd also note that our orders came in ahead of expectations with strong order growth in Electrical, both the Americas and Global. On a rolling 12-month basis, total electrical orders were up 7% and aerospace orders increased by 2%. This led to another quarter of growing and record backlogs up 27% for Electrical and 11% for Aerospace, with strong book-to-bill ratios. The growth in orders and backlog support our point of view on the strength of the mega trends that we're in the early stages and that our market should be strong for years to come. And given our Q1 results, we're raising our guidance for organic growth, segment margins and adjusted EPS for the year. On balance, we're very pleased with our start to the year. In the last few quarters, we shared our framework on how we think about key growth drivers for the company. This chart reflects the sixth secular growth trends that are positively impacting our business today, and quite frankly, for years to come. We continue to think Eaton is uniquely positioned in most of our businesses and are expected to see an acceleration in market-driven growth opportunities for years to come. In the last 3 earnings calls, we provided a summary of progress on infrastructure spending, reindustrialization, utility and data center markets. We also shared the data center -- the data, excuse me, we're tracking on mega projects, including when they are expected to have a material impact on our revenue, and an overview on the growth expectations and drivers for our Aerospace business. Today, we'll once again provide you an update on what we're seeing on mega projects, but we'll also take a moment to show you the momentum that we're seeing in the nonresidential construction project market for those projects under $1 billion. Additionally, we'll provide you with a summary of the growth outlook for industrial facilities and how we're positioned in this market, and lastly, because it's such a dynamic topic, we'll provide an updated view on how our now higher growth expectations for the data center market is unfolding. Turning to Slide 5 in the presentation. We summarized the number of mega projects that have been announced since January of 2021. And as a reminder, a mega project is a project with an announced value of $1 billion or more, and the number is now 415 projects. Once again, this is North America data, but we are seeing a similar trend in Europe, although the dollars are not as large.  Just a few points to note. We've now surpassed $1 trillion in announced megaprojects, double what we saw over the last -- this time last year and 3x the normal run rate. Approximately 16% of these projects have started but it does vary by type of project. For example, a large percentage of semiconductor and EV battery projects have started, but downstream chemical, power generation, renewables and data center projects have some of the lowest project start rates to date. And cancellation rates continue to be modest, around 10% and below historical rates. Using the current forecast, we expect over $100 billion to $150 billion of these projects to start this year. It's also worth noting that mega projects represent 15% of total nonresidential construction starts in 2023, a number that we expect to grow over the next 5 years. For projects that have started, we've won $1 billion of orders and our win rate is approximately 40%. We remain active in negotiations on another $1.4 billion of electrical content. Most of the projects represented here have not yet reached a negotiation stage. Turning to Slide 6. We want to highlight the largest part of nonresidential construction market, projects under $1 billion. This market is projected to be over $500 billion in 2024 and represents around 50% of the U.S. market, 56% increase since 2021 and a 16% CAGR. The market was actually up also 10% through Q1 of this year. So while mega projects grab a lot of the headlines, we're seeing significant strength in projects under $1 billion as well. And for projects less than $100 million, construction starts were up 15%, so once again, strength across the entire market. This momentum is naturally being driven by the same set of mega trends and stimulus spending that we're seeing on mega projects. The primary markets here include utility, power generation, renewable, water, wastewater, manufacturing and data centers. And our win rate in this segment is approximately 35%. Turning to Slide 7, we highlight the industrial facilities end market. As we've reported, this end market accounted for approximately 12% of Eaton's total revenue in 2023. Reindustrialization and nearshoring are having a particularly large impact on this market. Examples include semiconductor fabrication, EV and EV battery plants as well as LNG terminals. At the same time, industrial markets are undergoing growing pressure to decarbonize to lower cost and develop more sustainable operations. These challenges are naturally driving a significant increase in CapEx investment. It's also coming at a time when technology and digitalization are providing more value to data as a service, software, and therefore, the ability to provide operational intelligence. This allows customers to move from being reactive to proactive when managing energy and uptime, saving them time and money. For us, we increased both our content per project and our average selling price. These are the drivers that support our belief that industrial facilities end market will grow by some 7% between now, 2023 and 2026. Slide 8 provides an overview of the products and software that we sell as part of our industrial solutions portfolio. As noted, we think we have the broadest portfolio of products in the market. Our solutions are sold in both process and discrete manufacturing industries and are especially well suited to take advantage of the trends we discussed on the prior page. Our solutions help industrial companies optimize performance by lowering the cost of ownership and reducing complexity. They increase operational predictability with data-driven insights and enhanced safety, protecting people and assets. In addition to hardware and software, we provide a full suite of project management services, including design, specifying, commissioning, training, remote monitoring and obviously, aftermarket service. And our Brightlayer industrial software platform enables customers to preempt operational challenges because of the data and insights that come from our electrical equipment. Moving to Slide 9, you'll see an updated view on the data center market. Last fall, in our Q3 2023 earnings call. We highlighted the data center market and shared our view that we expected the market to grow at a 16% compounded growth rate between 2022 and 2025. We want to provide an update as we've seen continued momentum in this market, driven by the rise of AI, big data and certainly edge computing. As expected, the biggest increase is coming from the very strong demand for AI data centers which is reflected both in our orders and in our negotiation pipeline. Here, orders on a trailing 12-month basis have more than doubled, and our negotiations in the U.S. have increased by more than 4x. We now think the overall market grows at a 25% compounded growth rate between 2022 and 2025. And as you know, we have a strong position in the data center market and the data center/IT channel accounted for 14% of our revenue last year. Now I'll turn the presentation over to Olivier to cover the financials. Olivier Leonetti : Thanks, Craig. I'll start by providing a summary of our Q1 results. We posted a Q1 sales record of $5.9 billion, up 8% in total and organically. This represents 8 quarters of growth over 20% on a 2-year stack. We posted Q1 segment profit and margins record. Operating profit grew 27% and segment margin expanded 340 basis points to 23.1%. Adjusted EPS of $2.40 increased by 28% yet over the prior year. This is a Q1 record and well above the high end of our guidance range. This performance resulted in operating cash flow of $475 million, up 42% on a year-over-year basis and free cash flow of $292 million, up 40% versus prior year. As a percentage of full year guidance, both operating cash flow and free cash flow are improved versus prior year. On Slide 11, we summarize Electrical Americas' very strong results. We continue to raise the bar, setting new all-time records for sales, operating profit and margins. Organic sales growth remained strong at 17%, which reflects broad-based strength in our end markets with particular strength in industrial, data center and institutional end markets. On a 2-year stack, organic growth was up 39%. Electrical Americas has generated double-digit organic growth for 9 consecutive quarters. All-time record operating margin of 29.2% was up 630 basis points versus the prior year, benefiting primarily from higher volumes, effective management of price cost and improved manufacturing efficiency, partially offset by higher costs to support growth initiatives. On a rolling 12-month basis, orders were up 8% demonstrating a positive inflection as a result of the impact of the various megatrends. We had particular strength in data center end market. Also, our major project negotiations pipeline in Q1 was up 169% versus prior year and up 197% since Q1 2022. Electrical Americas backlog increased 31% year-over-year and was up 21% sequentially, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.2 on a rolling 12-month basis. These results underscore the tailwinds from secular trends, strong execution and robust backlog that have allowed us to increase growth and margin guidance for the year, which we will discuss later in the presentation. The next chart summarizes the results for our Electrical Global segment. Coincidently, Global results are mostly flat to last year. Organic growth was up 1%, offset entirely by FX headwinds. We had strength in data center, industrial, as well as commercial and institutional end markets. Regionally, we saw strength in our APAC and GEIS businesses, partially offset by weakness in our EMEA business. Operating margin was 18.3% which was flat to the prior year. Orders were up 4% on a rolling 12-month basis with strength in data center and utility end markets. Book-to-bill continues to remain strong. Q1 was 1.1 on a rolling 12-month basis. Before moving to our industrial businesses, I'd like to briefly recap the combined electrical segments. For Q1, we posted organic growth of 11% and segment margin of 25.3%, which was 430 basis points over prior year. On a rolling 12-month basis, orders inflected strongly positive, up 7% and our book-to-bill ratio for our electrical sector remains very strong at 1.2. We remain quite confident in our positioning for continued growth with strong margins in our overall electrical business. Page 13 highlights our Aerospace segment. We posted Q1 sales, operating profit and operating margin records. Organic growth was 9% for the quarter. Growth was driven by broad strength across all markets with particular strength in commercial OEM and aftermarket end markets, which were up 17% and 15%, respectively. Operating margin of 23.1% was up 60 basis points year-over-year, benefiting from higher volumes and effective management of price cost. On a rolling 12-month basis, orders increased 2%. Commercial OEM and aftermarket orders were particularly strong, and we expect that the military OEM order patterns will normalize in the second half. Year-over-year backlog increased 11% and was up 4% sequentially. On a rolling 12-month basis, our book-to-bill for our Aerospace segment remained strong at 1.1. Moving on to our Vehicle segment on Page 14. In the quarter, total revenue was down 2%, including a 3% organic decline, partially offset by a point of favorable FX. Weakness in the North America region was partially offset by strength in Asia Pacific. Operating margin came in at 16%, 150 basis points above prior year driven by effective management of price cost and improvement in manufacturing efficiencies, offset by lower sales volume. On Page 15, we show results for our e-mobility business. Sales were up 7% on an organic and total basis. Our organic growth significantly outperformed the market, driven by new program ramp-ups. Our OEM customers continue to face execution challenges, and while we anticipate improvements throughout the year, we have remained pragmatic in our volume forecast. As a result, we will discuss shortly that our full year growth guidance of 25% to 35% remains unchanged. Growth programs and investments drove the operating loss of $4 million. We continue to incur launch costs related to our growth programs expected to ramp up over the next coming quarters. In 2023, we won new programs with more than $1.3 billion of mature year revenue, and we continue to expand our pipeline of new opportunities in 2024 with our unique technologies, driven by our electrical pedigree. This will continue to drive our growth well above the market. Moving to Page 16, we show our Electrical and Aerospace backlog updated through Q1. As you can see, we continue to build backlog with electrical stepping up to $11.3 billion and Aerospace reaching $3.4 billion for a total backlog of $14.7 billion. Versus prior year, our backlogs have grown by 27% in Electrical and 11% in Aerospace. Electrical backlog benefited from acceleration in order intake from tailwinds from the secular trends, including hyperscale orders within the data center end market. As noted earlier, book-to-bill ratios for Electrical and Aerospace are 1.2 and 1.1, respectively. The continued growth in our backlog underscores our confidence in 2024 and beyond. Now I'll turn it back to Craig for the end market outlook and financial guidance updates. Craig Arnold : Thanks, Olivier. Turning to Page 17, we show a summary of our end market growth assumptions. Overall, our markets continue to perform as expected, and most of these indicators have not changed from what we shared in our Q4 earnings call. We are, however, seeing stronger-than-expected growth in data center and in commercial and institutional markets in the U.S., which is why we're raising our revenue guidance for the year. In contrast, what many are seeing in the macro economy, we continue to expect growth in 80% of our end markets, and much of this growth is supported by the large backlog numbers that Olivier shared. Moving to Page 18, we show our financial year organic growth and operating margin guidance. Overall, our 2024 organic growth is now expected to be between 7% and 9%, which is an increase of 50 basis points at the midpoint. We're raising our organic growth guidance in the Electrical Americas to 10% to 12% from 9% to 11%, and we're reiterating the growth guidance for the remaining segments. For segment margins, we're increasing the company's margin guidance range by 40 basis points at the midpoint to 23%. This is a result of the improved outlook in Electrical Americas, where we're seeing strong demand and strong performance. Here, we're increasing our margin outlook to 28% and a 100 basis point increase at the midpoint, and we're reiterating our guidance for the remaining segments. On the next page, we have the balance of our guidance metric for 2024 and Q2. For 2024, our adjusted EPS is expected to be between $10.20 and $10.60 a share. The $10.40 midpoint represents a 14% growth in adjusted EPS over prior year and a $0.25 increase over the initial 2024 guidance. The other elements of our guidance are unchanged. For Q2, we expect organic growth to be between 6.5% and 8.5%, segment margins to be between 22.4% and 22.8%, and adjusted EPS to be in the range of $2.52 to $2.62 a share. So let me just close with a summary on Page 20. Once again, the trends driving growth in our end markets continue to play out as expected and even better in our Electrical Americas business, driven by the data center market. We also delivered a strong quarter of financial results on the back of strong execution across the company. As a result, we raised our guidance for organic growth by 50 basis points, segment margins by 40 basis points and adjusted EPS by 25% at the midpoint. And in the quarter, we were especially pleased to see strength in our negotiations, our orders and the growth in our backlog, all of which hit all-time records, validating our medium- and long-term growth outlook. So we leave the quarter with a high level of confidence. Eaton will deliver higher growth, higher margins and consistent earnings growth for years to come. Our expectations are high, and that's exactly where they should be. With that, I'll open things up for any questions you may have. Yan Jin : Thanks, Greg. [Operator Instructions] With that, I will turn it over to the operator to give you guys the instruction. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question will come from the line of Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Joseph Ritchie : Craig, look, it's incredible to see the pipeline now over $1 trillion on the mega projects. I'm just curious, like as you talk to your customers, if you think about maybe labor as a constraint like how do you see this all playing out over the next couple of years? And like what are you -- what are you hearing from your customers in terms of like whether there are either additional products that you need to come to market with just given all the activity that's happening here? Craig Arnold : No, we appreciate the question, Joe, and it's obviously one that we're spending a lot of time internally looking at, and it's one of the things that's quite frankly, tempering our outlook for the year is the fact that we do believe that labor continues to be a bottleneck in certain industries and really in the economy overall. And so at this point, I think it's really too early to say to what extent it's going to resolve itself. One of the things that we're looking at as well is particular -- total labor participation rates. In general, those numbers, I would say, have been growing over time at a rate of 2% to 3%. I will tell you that the construction industry, the industry that we're participating in, really reversing what had been a long-term trend are actually growing at a faster rate. And so our industries are, in fact, growing at a faster rate in terms of labor participation than the underlying economy, which is really an encouraging sign. I mean, I think, in many ways, skilled trade today whether it's plumbers, contractors, electricians, welders, these are really good jobs and jobs that are going to be around for a long term. And I think some of that is playing out in the shift that we're seeing. But it's one of the things that we continue to watch. And it's one of the things, like I said, once again, that really tempers our outlook. We could obviously grow faster if these constraints are fully resolved and don't become a gating item for the industry overall. Joseph Ritchie : Got it. That's super helpful. And then I guess maybe -- I know you've got a bunch of growth questions from others. So maybe I'll turn to margins for a second. So you announced a restructuring program last quarter. There's a pretty wide gap right now between the really stellar margins you're putting up in the Electrical Americas business versus the Electrical Global business. Can you maybe just elaborate a little bit more on the restructuring plans? Is there some sense that you're going to try to maybe narrow the gap on the margin trajectory for those two businesses today? Craig Arnold : Yes. I mean I think the short answer is absolutely. We would intend and anticipate to narrow the gap between those two businesses and narrow the gap the right way, which is the Global business needs to do significantly better. We have no expectations at all that we'd see retrenchment in our Americas business. And so -- but I will say, as you think about the restructuring program that we launched, $375 million of spending, $325 million of benefits. 2/3 of that, more or less, will be in the Electrical segment with a heavy concentration in Global. So we are clearly working hard to improve margins in the Electrical Global business. One of the reasons why this gap kind of widened and opened up is that as we're all aware, in the U.S. market, the North America market is doing very well right now. There's a lot of activity. There's a lot of growth. We have a very strong strategic position in the North America margin -- market overall. And so there are just a lot of things today that are really positive in the Americas markets that are allowing us to continue to expand margins there. And as you know, a lot of the European markets have been much weaker than we anticipated. You see some of the macroeconomic data coming out of Europe, Germany specifically, and a lot of the market segments in Europe where we have a strong position are some of the weaker parts of the market. If you think about the MOEM segment, you see it in some of the automation data from some of the other electrical peer companies, the residential market. And so I think today, those margins will get better. If we look forward, we're obviously anticipating margins getting better, there's easier comps in the second half of the year as well. But without a doubt, there's plenty of opportunity to expand our margins in our Global segment. Operator : The next question is from Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research. Jeffrey Sprague : Just curious on data centers, Craig, your comment about like some of the mega projects haven't started yet there. Obviously, data center has been strong and a revenue driver for you there. So can you just elaborate on that? Are you kind of talking about you really haven't seen maybe kind of the AI-oriented investments coming through? Just kind of an interesting curious comment. And in last quarter when you did provide that kind of order conversion data for semi and other related investments, you didn't put data centers on that slide. So maybe you could address that element of the question also. Craig Arnold : Yes, I'd say that, to your point, Jeff, data center markets have been good and strong for a long time. And I think our data center numbers, I think we talked about growth in excess of 20%. But the order growth in the data center market, as we talked about, is much higher than that, much, much higher than that. And so if you think about a lot of these big mega projects, and where we're seeing this outsized growth in projects announced, in our negotiations, data centers is obviously one of the big contributors and the underlying rate of growth that we're seeing in negotiations and in orders is outstripping the very strong growth that we're seeing in our business. And so we were just trying to find some color in terms of mega projects and which of those are already showing up today in orders, which of those are already showing up somewhat in revenue, although most of it is not revenue yet and where we expect to continue to see even outsized growth as we move forward in the ensuing years, and data center is clearly going to be a big contributor. We talk about negotiations up 4x. So it is -- if the market just continues to grow, and we expect that market to be a much bigger piece of the total company as we look forward. Jeffrey Sprague : And then... Craig Arnold : What was the second question? I didn't... Jeffrey Sprague : Yes. When you provided that handy chart last quarter showing kind of the negotiation to order to sales conversion timeline. Actually, you did not put data centers on that chart. Does it differ significantly from those... Craig Arnold : I think -- and correct -- the team can correct me around the room if I'm wrong, I think data centers were embedded in that data. We gave you the aggregate data, I thought data centers were embedded in what we gave you. Jeffrey Sprague : Yes, I'm looking at slides... Craig Arnold : Different kinds of projects. And we were showing you some examples of different kinds of projects, but embedded in the overall data, I think that definitely included data centers. Yan Jin : Yes, we can follow up after this call. Jeffrey Sprague : Yes. And then just a second question, I'm sorry. Just on Electrical Americas margins, what would cause the margins to go down sequentially, right? Usually, Q1 is actually the lowest margin quarter of the year. It's the lowest revenue quarter in dollar value. Is there something in mix or otherwise that would cause it to step down from these levels? Craig Arnold : I'd say, as we look forward, as you know, we've made a number of announcements around capacity expansion. We're making some investments in commercial front end. We're making investments in technology. So there's a number of programs that we've made announcements last year and that we're investing in this year that will certainly be a bit of a gating factor in terms of margin expansion. I think the implied number is close to what it was in Q1, but I do take your point that we typically see margin expansion, we'll certainly see volume expansion in terms of the absolute revenue in the out quarters, but really it's more a function of spending and investments that we're making in the business. Operator : And the next question is from Deane Dray from RBC Capital Markets. Deane Dray : Just want to circle back on the data center demand here. And the idea here is you talk about labor constraints. But the industry and the folks that we're talking to on the data center planning side is they're nervous about the bottlenecks in some of the basic electrical backbone that you all providing. And so we saw this quarter an announcement in Europe with one of your European competitors signing a 5-year supply agreement to one of these data center operators. So -- and then they've also -- we've heard about transformers being backlogged for 2 years. So are there opportunities for you? I know you're increasing capacity in transformers, but are you looking at any of these longer-term supply agreements? Craig Arnold : Yes. The short answer is, Deane, it's absolutely yes. We are living in an environment right now where the market has a number of constraints, including electrical equipment. It's one of the reasons why we announced $1 billion of incremental investments that we're making in the company to deal with the specific bottlenecks that we have in our own manufacturing operations so that we can address the demand that we see in front of us. And quite frankly, given the demand that we're seeing even today in the business, those numbers will likely go up. So data centers continues to grow. I was responding to a specific question earlier around labor. But to your point, there are other constraints around electrical equipment, and we are, in fact, signing multiyear agreements with our customers to ensure that we have capacity in place to support the demand that they need from us. And so we are fully confident that we will not be the bottleneck in the industry. We will resolve the bottlenecks that we have in terms of our own electrical equipment, difficult to say where those other constraints will surface. Deane Dray : All right. That's really helpful. And then just away from data centers, just the idea of these mega projects, do you anticipate any mix change in what you are doing for direct ship versus going through distribution? Craig Arnold : I'd say distribution is really an important part of our go-to-market strategy, and we have really strong distributor partnerships that will always be an important part of our formula in terms of the way we go to market. Now there are, in fact, some market dynamics that suggest that there are certain kinds of projects in certain markets that do tend to be more of a direct-serve market than a market that is served through distribution. In some cases, data centers are a great example of that, where there are certain data center customers who want to be served direct. And so I do think there'll be a bit of a mix shift, not so much because it's a function of strategically, we're changing our approach as much as it is because there are certain market segments that are growing, big mega projects being a piece of that, that tend to be more direct served markets. Operator : Next question is from Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Julian Mitchell : Maybe I just wanted to start with Electrical Global. You started out the year with a sort of fairly soft topline there. Just maybe help us understand sort of the confidence of getting to that low mid-single-digit organic growth for the year. How quickly do we expect that acceleration, say, in the second quarter in EG? And if there's any particular region or end market that's doing the sort of heavy lifting on that sales growth improvement? Craig Arnold : Yes. I appreciate the question, Julian. I mean I'd say that we have, I would say, relatively modest growth assumptions for our Electrical Global segment. And we really, in Q1, performed largely in line with our expectations, a little weaker, quite frankly, in Europe than what we expected, but largely in line. And as I mentioned, in my outbound commentary, the comps get a bit easier as well in the second half of the year for Global. But today, I'd say we're growing in Asia. We had nice growth in our China and Asia Pacific business overall. Our GEIS business is growing, doing just fine. The weak spot, as we talked about, is what's happening today in the European Electrical business where very much like you saw in some of the peer data. Those markets have been weaker than what we anticipated. But I would say today, fairly conservative set of assumptions that we're using internally in terms of what we're anticipating from our Europe business overall, our global business overall, and really, it's largely a function of the comps getting easier as we continue throughout the balance of the year. We're not anticipating a significant change in the trajectory of the business but some modest improvement in the second half. Julian Mitchell : That's helpful. And just my second question was really to circle back on the margin outlook. So yes, your second quarter, you've got the implied sort of total company margin down 50 bps sequentially with some sales growth sequentially. So is the delta all in that sort of higher investments in Electrical Americas pulling down that margin sequentially. Is that what's going on there in Q2? Craig Arnold : Yes. No, I'd say that that's really what the difference is. There's nothing else -- it's embedded in our assumptions that would suggest that margins should fall off other than the incremental spending and investments that we're making in the business. As you saw in our Q1 results, very strong execution by the team, 60-plus percent incrementals. And so the team is really executing well. We anticipate that that execution will continue for the balance of the year, and it really is simply a reflection of the investments that we're making in the business for future growth. Operator : Our next question is from Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. C. Stephen Tusa : Just on that last question, can you maybe just be a little bit more specific about what you mean there on the amount of headwinds from these investments. I mean, you guys -- is there like an abrupt start-up cost in one of these facilities or something? Maybe just a little more color and maybe quantify that headwind. Craig Arnold : Yes. I wouldn't call it an abrupt start-up cost. But as you know, we made some announcements last year around capacity expansions. And those new capacity expansions start to come online. So obviously, you turn on all the depreciation, you have start-up costs associated with commissioning new lines and new plants. We're making additional investments in some of these commercial opportunities to deal with the better growth outlook that we've talked about. And so in terms of the specifics, obviously, we're not going to give you an exact dollar amount. But I would tell you that it's really tied specifically to supporting the outlook for growth. And quite frankly, we could do better. I mean the reality is we did better in Q1. Our team is executing extremely well. So we could do better than what's currently reflected, but it is today reflective of our best thinking. C. Stephen Tusa : Got it. And then just on the order front, one of your peers talked about some of these orders being delivered a little bit further out. You're adding the capacity. So maybe you can deliver in a bit more of an expedited way over the next couple of years. Should we think about this orders quarter converting further out than normal? Or are we now at kind of a more of a consistent lead time, albeit still probably a relatively long lead time, but are we still at kind of a consistent lead time that's been established over the last couple of years? Craig Arnold : I would say that lead times have not pushed out further. We talked over the last couple of years, the fact that the surge that we're seeing in orders has, in fact, extended lead times and for many of our markets overall. And I would say today, depending upon the product line, we've made some progress in terms of lead times, but we've also seen, as you saw in the data, also a resurgence quite frankly, of orders with very strong orders in Q1 that I would say in backlogs that continue to grow. So I would say, in general, lead times have not changed materially. They've gotten not materially worse, they've gotten not that materially better. C. Stephen Tusa : Yes. So in other words, the orders that you booked this quarter should kind of convert at the same lead time as we've seen in the last 1.5 years type of thing? Craig Arnold : Yes. I mean I'd say it varies depending upon which market segment. I mean there are -- in some cases, we are getting for some of the hyperscale data center guys are trying to get out in front and maybe placing some orders earlier than they normally would. But for the most part, there's been no significant change in the order pattern. Operator : The next question is from Scott Davis from Melius Research. Scott Davis : Kind of intrigued by this concept of long-term supply agreements because I don't believe that's really been something that we've seen in the past in this industry. But can you -- for whatever you're willing to share here, help us understand, are these like take-or-pay type contracts? What is kind of the vision in forming these type of partnerships. I saw the Schneider Compass announcement a few months ago, but haven't -- not exactly sure what you guys are doing. Craig Arnold : I mean, and as you can imagine, Scott, we're living in an environment today where these industries are growing much faster than they have historically, and the outlook for growth continues to strengthen and, in many cases, get better and where -- and you have capacity constraints. And so we are in a very different world today with respect to ensuring that we work with our customers and our suppliers on a multiyear basis to ensure that we have capacity to support the demand that's out in front of us. And that's really what's driving this change in the way we contract and partner with many of our customers. So I think it's a perfectly logical thing to do. It's a needed thing to do in this environment. And to your point, I mean, most of these contracts are contracts that are structured in a way that ensures that while they won't necessarily be exactly take or pay, but they ensure that we have protections for the investments that we're making so that we're not putting capacity in that's not needed. So we feel very good about the nature of the contracts, the way they're structured, to ensure that the company is protected. Scott Davis : Wow, that's interesting, and congrats on that. So  this is -- I'm not looking for an exact number. I'm just trying to get a sense. If you think about -- we all know transformers are lead times along. But when you think about the percentage of your SKUs that are sold out right now, is there some sort of number that you could guess 30%, 40% of your SKUs? I mean I know it's broader than just transformers and switch gear, but any estimate there? I'm just kind of curious to see if that's the majority or it's still kind of sub-50% of SKUs? Craig Arnold : Yes, I'd say that we really haven't run the math, to be honest with you, Scott, in terms of what percent. I will tell you that maybe an easy way to think about it is that the long cycle parts of our portfolio generally today, we have capacity constraints on the long-cycle stuff and on the short-cycle stuff, not so much. And I think our split is roughly 75-25 between long cycle and short cycle. So maybe that's a good proxy for where we're actually at capacity or close to sold out and where we're not. Operator : And the next question is from Nicole DeBlase from Deutsche Bank. Nicole DeBlase : Just maybe starting with Electrical Americas, obviously, really impressive 17% organic growth this quarter. You guys raised the guidance but still embeds pretty big decel throughout the year. So is that just -- can we kind of chalk that up to conservatism, Craig? Or is there something that you guys are seeing with respect to growth in the rest of the year, that kind of causes that step down? Craig Arnold : I appreciate the question, Nicole. And obviously, it was a really strong start to the year for our Electrical Americas business, and they posted really, really positive numbers. And I'd say maybe it's early in the year. And we have one quarter behind us, and we just thought it's prudent at this point, given the fact that it's early in the year to let's see how the rest of the year unfolds. Certainly, if things continue with what we've seen, there could be upside to that number. I would say as well that as you think about as the year goes on, the comps get in some cases, a little bit more challenging. There's a little bit less contribution from price in some of the subsequent quarters. But once again, the business outperformed our expectation across the board most of which is obviously on the volume side in Q1. And so there is certainly the potential that the business does better than what we're currently forecasting. Nicole DeBlase : Got it. That's very fair. And then similar question on free cash. You didn't raise the guidance for the full year despite higher earnings. Is there something going on with net working capital or some other line item that causes the offset? Or is it just a bit early in the year, and you kind of want to see how that line item trends? Craig Arnold : No, I'd say largely, it's early in the year. And just really, we just thought it's prudent at this juncture not to take the number up. We'll obviously revisit it as we get through Q2, but it's just early in the year. Operator : And the next question is from the line of Andrew Obin from Bank of America. Andrew Obin : Yes. I guess the question is everybody is asking about data centers, but maybe a slightly different direction. China, what are we seeing? How is your Electrical business in China performing within Electrical Global? And you have a very specific strategy there on JVs. Just maybe -- just talk about how the deals are performing relative to your expectations. So the two-part question. Craig Arnold : No, I appreciate the question, Andrew. And I would say our China business continues to perform very well. In fact, we grew high single digits in Q1 in our China business. And to your point, we do have a very specific strategy for how we play the China market specifically through joint ventures. And in many cases, as you know, these are minority joint ventures. And our joint ventures, by the way, if you just take a look at our joint venture performance, we obviously don't consolidate this revenue, but they grew some 35% in 2023. So we're getting a lot of great growth in the joint ventures in China. And as you know, strategically, what we tried to do there is really finding a way to partner with local Chinese companies who then give us the ability to broaden our portfolio to compete in Tier 2 and Tier 3 markets, both in China and around the world. And so we're absolutely thrilled with how well these JVs are playing out, and our team is executing, and it just gives us a lot of additional capabilities as we think about future growth of the company. Andrew Obin : Excellent. And just a more technical question. I don't know if -- I apologize if I missed it, but can you just talk about electrical channel inventories on the product side? Where are we? Craig Arnold : Yes. I would say that, once again, I think inventories are largely well balanced and well aligned right now. I mean, as you can tell by the growth in our backlogs, our backlogs continue to grow and lead times are not getting better and our book-to-bill, 1.2 in Electrical, which I think is a great indicator of where we sit today with respect to inventory in the channel. So today, I would say that it's obviously going to be the odd product line or 2 where the dealer inventories could be a little long. But overall, inventories, I think, today are very well balanced and given the backlogs that we continue to build and certainly all the conversations that I'm in with our distributors and customers is that they're looking for more stuff sooner, and they're looking for shorter lead times than we can currently deliver to. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Jeff Hammond from KeyBanc. Jeffrey Hammond : Craig, just on this data center growth curve, in the slides, you kind of bump it from 16% to 25%. And I think the technology there you had a different time frame, but I think the pushback of the 11 -- 10.8% growth was like why isn't it higher? So just wondering how maybe we should think about that 10.8% differently and how to kind of incorporate capacity constraints or labor constraints versus kind of the numbers you put in the deck today? Craig Arnold : I would say that what we've seen since we posted those other numbers, which were quite frankly a little bit stale, was that we certainly have seen just fundamental data center market independent of what's happening with AI has been accelerating. The world, as we've talked about before, just continue to generate processed or increasing amounts of data. And then on top of that, you have this explosive trend in AI and these AI training data centers just require and consume just orders of magnitude more power than a traditional data center, and we're obviously starting to see those orders and those negotiations come through now. And so that's really what's driving the change in the outlook for the market, not so much that we've decided that the labor constraints have been resolved, particularly or any particular power constraints overall have been resolved. It's really simply a function of the fact that what we're seeing in our negotiations, what we're seeing in our orders have just accelerated that much between the old number and the new number. Jeffrey Hammond : Okay. That's helpful. And then just on the capacity expansion, I think in 3Q, you laid out kind of the areas you're bucketing for investment. Can you just talk about what starts to phase in earlier? Do you get any capacity online this year? Or is this more into '25? And then if anything is kind of baked into the guide for these capacity adds this year? Craig Arnold : We do start to see, as I mentioned, in terms of kind of what holds the margin expansion back a little bit is the fact that we are, in fact, bringing on and starting up new lines and new facilities beginning certainly, a lot of the spending in Q1, but certainly in the second half of the year, we start to see some of that capacity come free to the point where we actually have the ability to deliver more. So it's really second half of this year and then into 2025 in earnest. Operator : Our next question is from Phil Buller from Berenberg. Philip Buller : We've talked about capacity constraints several times. It sounds like you're pretty much at capacity in places. And I know you flagged this $1 billion of investment. I guess I'm wondering if $1 billion is actually sufficient to capture with that -- that growth that's yours to lose, I guess, as I'm sure you get a really nice return on making those kinds of investments. So do you see an opportunity to invest more beyond $1 billion for CapEx expansion? Or are you choosing not to do so because of these bottlenecks like other people's labor, perhaps meaning you don't necessarily need to invest today and instead can do a bit more on the pricing side? That's question one. Craig Arnold : I appreciate the question. And as you can imagine, we're spending a lot of time right now internally reassessing and reevaluating whether or not we're doing enough. The $1 billion, by the way, that's an incremental number that's on top of the base. So I just want to make sure I clarify that. But we don't -- we don't intend to be the bottleneck here. We want to make sure that we have all of the capacity in place to deal with the growth that we see, the forecast that we're getting from our customers. So we are not constraining ourselves with respect to the investments. .  One of the good things about our business model overall, and I remind the group is that we do tend to be relatively asset light. A lot of what we do in the electrical business is assembly and test. So we can bring on relatively significant amounts of capacity for relatively speaking, not a lot of CapEx dollars. And so we do intend to revisit the number given the fact that our forecasts are going up especially in certain verticals like data center to make sure that we do have enough capacity. Philip Buller : And on that topic, I guess, an extension of it, the competitive landscapes when markets are as great as this, normally someone tries to find a way to play perhaps by adding capacity. Are you seeing any shift in market shares either from traditional players or from new entrants, please? Craig Arnold : Yes. No. I mean, not particularly. I mean everybody is obviously adding capacity. The market is good for everyone right now. One of the things that we tried to give you a sense for how we're doing is that by providing some of these win rate numbers that we showed you from mega projects, some of the win rate numbers that we showed you for non-res construction projects is an indicator of the fact that we think we're doing very well in the context of this expanding market. And so I'm not -- I don't anticipate dramatic share shifts in the market, especially in a period of time when the industry is sold out in so many places.  And the other thing I would tell you in terms of -- we oftentimes get the question around new entrants, Chinese competitors and others coming into our market. And I would say that we really are not seeing any material impact from, let's say, the Chinese or other electrical equipment providers in the North America market. We have a strong position here. We have an outstanding channel. We're absolutely well known in the market. The bigger, the more complex the project, the more likely they are to pick a company like Eaton. So I think we're just very well positioned for the future here. Operator : Our next question is from Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research. Nigel Coe : The piece negotiation numbers are just extraordinary. I just want to make sure I understand the definitions. So would a negotiation be where you have an active negotiation or RFP in place with a -- and this represents the dollar number of potential contracts under negotiation. And then, when you think about, say, a data center or especially data center given the permitting and power challenges, would that project be fully permitted before you get into a negotiation situation? Craig Arnold : Yes. The answer is yes and yes. Negotiation would be a place where we are actually in an active negotiation in response to an RFP, request for proposal a request for quote. And certainly, if you think about data centers and others, once again, these projects tend to be already permitted down the road. As I did mention in some of the outbound data, there's always been a level of cancellations, especially when you look at some of these mega projects, and we talked about in my outbound commentary that the cancellation rate that we're seeing is around 10%. That rate is actually below what we've seen historically, but there's always going to be a certain level of cancellations in any of these projects, but they -- absolutely these tend to be or generally approved projects before we get to a negotiation. Nigel Coe : Okay. And I know you've got about 10 questions on capacity. So let's throw another one. Get away from the new greenfield capacity, but thinking about your existing footprint, are there opportunities to add another line or another shift extend over time to increase capacity in existing footprints? Or is there just to be constraint and that's just not on the table? Craig Arnold : Yes. I mean I think it varies depending upon which product line you're talking about. In some cases, it is, in fact, us adding a line in existing footprint because we do have capacity to do it. In some cases, it's adding additional shifts, utilizing existing assets. But in some cases, it means a new greenfield facility, and we've had to, in fact, stand up some additional manufacturing plants to deal with the growth that we're seeing. So it's really a combination of all of those and varies depending upon which particular product line or business you're referring to. Yan Jin : Okay. Thanks, guys. We have reached to the end of the call. As always, our team will be available to address any follow-up questions. Thanks for joining us, and have a great day, guys. Craig Arnold : All right. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T TeleConference. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host,. Please go ahead. Yan Jin : Good morning. Thank you all for joining us for Eaton's second quarter 2024 earnings call. With me today are Craig Arnold, our Chairman and CEO; and Olivier Leonetti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our agenda today includes operating remarks by Craig, then he will turn it over to Oliver who will highlight the Company's performance in the second quarter. As we have done in our past calls, we'll be taking questions at the end of Craig's closing commentary. The press release and the presentation we'll go through today have been posted on our website. This presentation, including adjusted earnings per share, adjusted free cash flow and other non-GAAP measures. They are reconciled in the appendix. A webcast of this call is accessible on our website and will be available for replay. I would like to remind you that our commentary today will include statements related to the expected future results of the Company and are therefore forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our forecasted projection due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and the presentation. With that, I will turn it over to Craig. Craig Arnold : Okay. Thanks, Yan. We'll start with some highlights on Page 3. And I'll lead off by noting that we delivered another strong quarter, and we're pleased with the first half of the year. Our teams continue to deliver on our commitments propelled by strong markets and good execution, exceeding our expectations and consensus on strong revenue, margins and earnings per share growth. We generated adjusted EPS of $2.73 in the quarter, an all-time record and up 24% from prior year. We also delivered record segment margins of 23.7%, up 210 basis points from last year. And our markets continue to be strong. On a rolling 12-month basis, electrical orders were up 9% and aerospace orders increased by 4%. This led to another quarter of growing and record backlogs, up 27% in Electrical and 14% Aerospace with strong book-to-bill ratios. The strength in our orders and backlogs continue to support our view that the megatrends will keep the Company growing for some time to come. We're in the early stages and once again, our markets are well positioned for the future. And our growing backlog allows us to once again raise our full year guidance. We're raising our guidance on organic growth, segment margins adjusted EPS and cash flow for the year. On balance, we're very pleased with our results, and we're well positioned for the second half of the year. Turning to Page 4. We once again are sharing the key trends in end markets that are expected to drive Eaton's long-term growth. The broad number of megatrends noted on this chart have created and will continue to create a strong growth environment for the above end markets. And Eaton is uniquely positioned in that these are our primary end markets. As a reminder, we're in the early phase and expect to see growth for years to come. Today, we'll continue our practice of covering one of these megatrends and how it's impacting growth in one of our key markets. Last quarter, we gave an end market update on our industrial facilities and markets as well as our latest view on growth expectations in the rapidly growing data center market. Today, we'll once again provide an update on reindustrialization through the lens of mega projects where the activity just remains extremely robust. And we'll provide a summary of our growth outlook for our single largest end market commercial and institutional facilities. Before turning our attention to a specific market, we did want to once again remind you of the broad-based nature of our growth expectations. So, turning to Slide 5. We summarize the growth rates in our key end markets. This data has not changed from what we shared in recent quarters or at our technology showcase earlier this year. And I'd say, in many ways, this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. in that the megatrends we shared are having a broad and significant impact on the growth outlook for most of our end markets, and we're seeing the benefit in our sales results, and more significantly in our orders, backlog and negotiation pipeline, all of which are at record levels and growing. And we'll share in a few slides, we're investing to support the orders and commitments that we received from our customers. Turning to Slide 6 in the presentation. We once again provide a summary of mega projects that have been announced in January of 2021 in the North America market. And as a reminder, a mega project is a project with an announced value of $1 billion or more, and the list now includes 444 projects and $1.4 trillion of cumulative value. This is double where we were this time last year, and the backlog for mega projects now stands at $1.6 trillion, up some 25%. It's important to point out that we have not seen any slowdown in the number of announced projects. In fact, Q2 was one of the strongest quarters ever. Recently, we've seen data center and power generation/renewable projects take the lead in new project announcements, these two project types represent some 40% of announced projects in the last 12 months. And the cancellation rate continued to be modest, around 11% which is well below historical levels. Note that only 15% of these projects have started, and for projects that have started, we've won over $1.4 billion of orders and our win rate has been approximately 40%. We're actively negotiating another $1.3 billion of electrical customers. There's lots more to come here. Turning to Slide 7. We continue to highlight the commercial and industrial end markets. For 2023, commercial and industrial institutional end markets represented 20% of total Eaton sales and 28% of our electrical sales. And for Eaton overall, we estimate that new office real estate exposure is only 2% to 3% of our revenues. We noted this has been a concerning point for some of you, but as you can see, it represents a very small part of our sales. While the entire category is growing, we expect to see significant strength in the institutional infrastructure segments, which represent 50% of our C&I exposure in Electrical Americas. Institutional infrastructure includes education, health care, government and includes waste and wastewater. I'd also point out that the electrical content in these two segments is much higher than office buildings and other light industrial projects -- excuse me, light commercial projects. And as noted, the same set of megatrends, including digitalization, energy transition and stimulus spending are also driving out growth in this segment. and something that we expect to continue for years to come. On Slide 8, we provide an overview of the products and software that we sell as part of our commercial and institutional building portfolio. We include this slide to provide a perspective on how broadly we play across the electrical infrastructure and buildings. In fact, we have the industry's broadest set of electrical solutions. Some of the newer categories for us include energy storage, EV charging network managers, microgrid controllers that control energy behind the meter. In addition to the entire suite of digitally enabled hardware, we have our bright layer software suite that does energy management across the building and campuses, all of which are supported our comprehensive service organization. On Slide 9, we want to provide an update on our incremental growth investments. As a reminder, we're investing more than $1 billion of incremental capital to support growth with $750 million in North America over the next few years. These investments expand our production capacity for a variety of products and support most of our electrical end markets. As you're aware, the market has several capacity constraints. So, we're working closely with customers to ensure that our capacity additions are in line with the demand and in many cases, our contractual agreements. To provide you with a feeling of the magnitude of these investments, will impact 25 of our sites and add over 2 million square feet of manufacturing space. Overall, these projects remain on track with many sites already ramping up new capacity, additional production capacity will be coming online later this year and into the first half of 2025. To note a couple of recent milestones, we recently opened a new state-of-the-art campus in Helsinki to increase capacity of UPS systems, and this obviously includes our latest energy-aware UPS. This is actually the industry's leading UPS and is 30% smaller than most of the competitive products. And most recently, we signed an agreement to build a new electrical campus in Dubai, to expand our commercial, manufacturing and support functions in the rapidly growing Middle East region. Turning to Page 10. We're excited to have closed a strategic investment in NordicEPOD. NordicEPOD designs and assembles standardized power modules for the European data center market. What's unique about their solution is that it's designed to standardize and it's a pre-engineered system that allows for faster market response. The standard power module or EPOD, contains all the critical power, electrical gear, backup power, cooling and control systems needed to support a data center. The EPODs are manufactured in Norway are designed to operate in harsh weather environments, and can supply up to 2 megawatts of electrical power. I'd also note that the power modules are an increasingly preferred approach for many of the data center customers in Europe. And Eaton will naturally supply a significant amount of the electrical equipment and services. This is an outstanding new platform that will allow Eaton to increase our participation in the rapidly growing European data center market. Now I'll turn it over to Olivier, who will take us through the financial results for the quarter. Olivier Leonetti : Thanks, Craig. I'll start by providing a summary of our Q2 results. We posted record sales of $6.4 billion, up 8% in total and up 9% organically. This represents nine quarters of growth of 20% on a two-year stack. We posted record segment profit and margins. Operating profit grew 90% and segment margin expanded 210 basis points to 23.7%. Adjusted EPS of $2.73 increased by 24% over the prior year. This is a quarterly record and well above the high end of our guidance range. This performance resulted in Q2 record operating cash flow of $946 million, up 11% year-over-year, and Q2 record free cash flow of $759 million, up 10% versus prior year. On Slide 12, we summarize Electrical Americas, very strong results. We continue to raise the bar, setting new records for sales, operating profit and margin. Organic sales growth remained strong at 13%, which reflects strength in data center and industrial end markets. On two-year stack, organic growth is up 32%. Electrical Americas has generated double-digit organic growth for 10 consecutive quarters. Record operating margin of 29.9% was up 300 basis points versus prior year, benefiting from higher sales and manufacturing efficiencies that were partially offset by higher costs to support growth initiatives. On a rolling 12-month basis, orders were up 11%, demonstrating strength across the various megatrends. We have particular strength in the data center end market. Also, our major project negotiations pipeline in Q2 was up 18% versus prior year and up 42% since Q2 2022. Electrical Americas backlog increased 29% year-over-year with a book-to-bill ratio of 1.2 on a rolling 12-month basis. These results underscore the tailwinds from secular trends, strong execution and robust backlog that have allowed us to increase growth and margin guidance for the year which we will discuss later in the presentation. This chart summarizes the results for our Electrical Global segment. Organic growth was up 3.5%, partially offset by FX headwinds. We have strength in data center markets, partially offset by weaknesses in residential end markets. Regionally, we continue to see strength in our APAC and GEIS businesses, partially offset by weakness in our EMEA business. Operating margin of 19% was up 50 basis points versus prior year, driven by higher sales and operating efficiencies, partially offset by wage inflation. Orders were up 7% on a rolling 12-month basis with strength in data center and utility end markets. Book-to-bill continues to remain strong. Q2 was 1.1 on a rolling 12-month basis. Before moving to our industrial businesses, I'd like to briefly recap the combined electrical segments. For Q2, we posted organic growth of 10% and segment margin of 26% which was up 260 basis points over prior year. On a rolling 12-month basis, orders were up 9%, and our book-to-bill ratio for our electrical sector remains very strong at 1.1. We remain confident in our positioning for continued growth with strong margins in our overall electrical business. Page 14 highlights our Aerospace segment. We posted record sales and a Q2 record operating profit. Organic growth was 13% for the quarter, driven by strength in commercial OEM, commercial aftermarket and military OEM. Operating margin of 21.5% was down 100 basis points year-over-year, driven by operating inefficiencies and higher costs to support growth initiatives that were partially offset by higher sales. On a rolling 12-month basis, orders increased 4%, driven by commercial OEM and aftermarket. Within the quarter, orders increased 21% year-over-year with commercial OEM up 22% and military OEM up 53%. Year-over-year backlog increased 14% and was up 3% sequentially. On a rolling 12-month basis, our book-to-bill for our Aerospace segment remains strong at 1.1. And we are pleased with more than $2 billion Life of Program wins in the quarter. Moving to our vehicle segment on Page 15. In the quarter, total revenue was down 4%, including a 3% organic decline and 1 percentage point of unfavorable FX. Weakness in the North America light vehicle market and a European truck was partially offset by strength in South America. Operating margin came in at 18%, 270 basis points above prior year, driven by operating efficiencies offsetting lower volume. And we are pleased to have won $83 million in mature year sales across our commercial and passenger vehicle portfolio. On Page 16, we show results for our e-mobility business. Sales were up 18% on an organic and total basis. Our organic growth significantly outperformed the market, driven by new program ramp-ups in the European market. Operating profit was $2 billion, and we continue to incur large cost related to new programs expected to ramp up over the next coming quarters. In the quarter, we also launched major power protection programs, battery disconnect units and Breaktor and were awarded additional $82 million in mature year sales. Moving to Page 17. We show our Electrical and Aerospace backlog updated through Q2. As you can see, we continue to build backlog with electrical stepping up to $11.4 billion and Aerospace reaching $3.5 billion for a total of $14.9 billion. Versus prior year, our backlogs have grown by 27% in electrical and 14% in Aerospace. Electrical backlog benefited from acceleration in order intake from tailwinds of the secular trends, including hyperscale orders within the data center end market. As noted earlier, book-to-bill Electrical and Aerospace are 1.1 and 1.1, respectively. The continued growth in our backlog underscores our confidence in 2024 and beyond. Now, I'll turn it back to Craig for the end market outlook and financial guidance updates. Craig Arnold : Thanks, Olivier. Turning to Page 18. We show a summary of our end market growth assumptions for the year. Overall, our markets continue to perform as expected, and most of these indicators have not changed from what we shared during our last two earnings calls. We are, however, seeing stronger-than-expected growth in data centers and in commercial and institutional markets in the U.S., which is why we're raising our revenue growth guidance for the year. We continue to expect growth in about 80% of our end markets supported by the key megatrends of electrification, energy transition, reindustrialization and digitalization. Moving to Page 19, we show our fiscal year organic growth and operating margin guidance. Overall, our 2024 organic growth is now expected to be between 8% and 9%, which is an increase of 50 basis points at the midpoint, raising our organic growth guidance in Electrical Americas by 150 basis points to 11.5% to 13.5% from 10% to 12% and in Aerospace by 100 basis points to 10% to 12% from 9% to 11%. We're lowering and tightening the range of our e-mobility organic growth guidance to 17% to 23% given the well-reported softening in some of these end markets, and we're reiterating the growth guidance for the remaining segments. For segment margins, we're increasing the Company's margin guidance range by 50 basis points at the midpoint to 23.5%. This is driven by the improved outlook in Electrical Americas, where we're seeing strong demand and strong operational execution. In this segment, we're increasing our margin outlook by 90 basis points to a midpoint of 28.9%. We're also reiterating our guidance for remaining segments, and we're well positioned to continue to deliver strong financial performance for the balance of the year. On the next page, we have additional guidance for metrics for 2024 and Q3. For 2024, our adjusted EPS is expected to be between $10.65 and $10.75 a share, the $10.70 midpoint represents 17% growth in adjusted EPS over the prior year, a $0.55 increase over the initial 2024 guidance and a $0.30 increase over the prior guidance. We tightened the range for free cash flow and now expect $4.2 billion to $4.4 billion for operating cash flow and $3.4 billion to $3.6 billion for free cash flow, an increase of $100 million at the midpoint on both measures. For Q3, we expect organic growth to be between 8% and 9%, segment margins to be between 23.5% and 23.9% and adjusted EPS in the range of $2.73 to $2.83 a share. So let me just close with a summary on Page 21. Once again, the trends driving growth in our end markets continue to play out as we expected, even better in our Electrical Americas business, driven by data center markets and the reindustrialization trend that we're seeing across multiple markets in North America. We also delivered a strong quarter of financial results and continue to see outstanding execution on our key initiatives across the Company. As a result, we raised our guidance for organic growth by 50 basis points our segment margins by 50 basis points and our adjusted EPS by $0.30 at the midpoint. In the quarter, we were especially pleased to see the strength in our negotiations, our orders and our growth and backlog, all of which are at record levels, validating our medium- and long-term growth outlook. So, we leave the quarter with a high level of confidence when we say Eaton will deliver higher growth, higher margins and consistent earnings growth for years to come. And with that, I'll open things up for any questions you may have. Yan Jin : Thanks, Craig. [Operator Instructions] With that, I will turn it over to the operator to give you guys the instructions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question will come from the line of Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Joe Ritchie : Craig, I want to start with, I guess, maybe just a longer-term question on. I'm sure you witnessed what happened with the PJM auction this past week and how they saw record high prices. I'm just trying to get an understanding for ultimately what that means for your utility business going forward and when you can maybe start to see an inflection. I know that business has been growing well, but maybe see a further inflection given how tight capacity is. Craig Arnold : Yes. I mean, as we've talked about, Joe, and I appreciate the question that the utility market is just one of many markets for us that we're absolutely thrilled about the growth prospects on -- I mean, as we talked about these big trends of beginning with energy transition, the electrification of the economy, climate change and the need to build grid resiliency. All of these factors converging at the same time are just creating a pretty unique set of conditions in terms of those opportunities into utility markets. And as we talked about before on this call, in one of the longest lead time products that probably exist in the electrical industries is getting an electrical transformer. So, I'd say that business for us is it is a big part of the Company, some 15% as we set up our total market exposure. We talked about our long-term growth rates being in the kind of the low teens for that business. And so, we are already seeing quite attractive growth in the utility market, including in this current quarter, and we expect it to go on for some time to come. Joe Ritchie : Yes, that's helpful, Craig. And I know I like that you guys highlighted the investments that you're making to increase capacity I guess if I take that 2 million plus in additional square footage, like what does that represent as a percentage of your total capacity today? And then as you think about how much leeway that gives you flexibility that gives you in the coming years, does that make you good through 2027, 2028, like how much flexibility does this give you? Craig Arnold : I appreciate the question. In terms of a percentage ad, I don't have that number off hand. So, we can certainly get that number for you. But I think the way to think about it is that in every one of those businesses where we are capacity constrained, we're making investments in capacity to deal with, let's call it, today, our midterm outlook. Obviously, depending upon which piece of the business you're talking about, the response time to put on new capacity varies widely. We can do it relatively quickly in our electric assemblies\u2019 businesses in a business-like transformers for example, that go into lots of different markets, not just the utility market, the lead times there tend to be longer given the type of manufacturing. And so, I would just tell you that today, we're investing to win here. We're making the investments that our customers expect and need us to make. And in many cases, we're getting long-term commitments for customers to ensure that we're not putting in too much capacity. But I can just say it's something that we've done for a long time. We know how to do it well, and we're going to be ready to support our customers as they continue to grow. Operator : The next question is from Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead. Jeff Sprague : Craig, really solid results and outlook. As you may or may not be aware because you're not watching everybody else's prints like we are. But sort of the takeaway from the week has been companies, kind of missing and lowering or making the numbers but cutting organic growth on weaker project-related outlooks. And I'm not surprised you're outperforming given kind of the secular exposures you have. But where you have exposure to smaller projects or machine OEM and things like that. Are you seeing pockets of weakness underneath the surface, again, obviously being masked by data centers and other things, but just kind of the general lay of the land and the industrial landscape out there? Craig Arnold : Jeff, appreciate that question. And one of the things, if you recall that we've reported on during the last earnings call because one of the things we wanted to convey is that, we're spending a lot of time focusing on mega projects because it is a fundamental change from the historical patterns in the industry and the sheer number and size of them, and it is changing the dynamics of the business in terms of our order flows. But the small projects as well, those projects that are under $1 billion, what we reported on the last earnings call is that we're seeing a very similar pattern of growth in projects under $1 billion. In fact, I don't recall the number off hand, but... Olivier Leonetti : 16%. 16%. Craig Arnold : 16%, roughly, up 16%. So, we are really seeing a broad-based increase in our project-related business, whether it's the mega projects that we spend a lot of time talking about or the stuff that tends to be more of the smaller flow projects that we've always seen inside the business. And so, no, I would say today, we have not seen any let up at all in the level of activity. And as we talked about in the mega project slide, Q2 was one of the biggest quarters ever. Those projects continue to come in at a significant rate. Our negotiations overall, in our electrical business continued to be at record high levels. And so, we're obviously mindful and watchful but we've not seen a slowdown. And by the way, I'll assure you, by the way, we do to all the other prints as well. We are obviously staying attuned to what's going on more broadly in the marketplace and our business continues to do well. Jeff Sprague : Interesting stuff. And then maybe just a little bit more color on the global side of electrical, Olivier, hit some of it in his prepared remarks. But some of these secular forces ought to come to bear in Europe and elsewhere, eventually. Is it just resi weakness and kind of general kind of macro-related pressures that hold it back? Obviously, I'm not expecting it to grow like Americas, but it just seems like there should be prospects for growth there to pick up maybe perhaps as we move into next year. Craig Arnold : Yes. I think, I mean your statement is largely accurate that the megatrends that we talk about of energy transition, electrification, digitalization, all of those trends are just as relevant in Europe as they are in the North America market. I will say, though, if you think about some of the big differences in what's driving perhaps this outperformance in the U.S. is really a lot of reindustrialization, a lot of investments in manufacturing and LNG and other sectors, data center, where you have manufacturing that is historically taking place in other regions of the world. Now, those investments are being made in the U.S. Obviously, these investments are also being helped and supported by a number of these stimulus programs as well. And so over time, we would clearly expect Europe to see more significant impact, although within those same verticals, data centers, for example, utilities, we are seeing good growth in our global businesses. not at the same extent as the U.S., but it's being overwhelmed by the macro market for sure in terms of the overall economy that we see in Europe, and you don't see the same reindustrialization trend taking place there. And the markets overall doing well, and we're pleased. Operator : The next question is from Andrew Obin from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Andrew Obin : I just want to touch on maybe just digging a little bit more into AI data centers. Can you just talk about sort of the pace of electrical orders and your win rate on -- specifically on the AI data center side? Craig Arnold : Andrew, I appreciate the question because, obviously, this is perhaps the hottest topic in the world right now in terms of what's going on with AI and how that's driving increased investments in data centers. And as I think this group is well aware, these AI-centric or training data centers consume a lot more power and a lot more electricity than your conventional data center, so the basic cloud-based data centers. The first thing I would say is that when you think about the growth that we're seeing today in our data center business, and you think about the growth projections over time, very little of this today is a result of specific investments in AI. It's coming. We're quoting a lot of projects. I think if you take a look at what the industry -- some of the industry leaders talked about last year, that 5% to 10% of their capital spending is an AI-related data centers. So, I would say most of the growth related to this expansion that we expect to come is still out in front of us with respect to AI data centers. It's coming. And I'd say, in terms of its contribution to our orders, is very much aligned with that. Most of the orders that we're getting, 90-plus percent of the orders that we're getting are really tied to your conventional data centers as more and more companies like our zone, move applications to the cloud from on-premise. If you think about this, this massive increase in data that we're all generating, consuming and storing, that's really what's driving the growth in data centers today. In AI, I would tell you, it fell largely a future. And in fact, when you look at the total backlog today, of data center projects close to $140 billion. And if you look at that in the context of historical build rates, that's eight years of production, and we haven't hit the inflection point yet for AI. So, we think what happens ultimately is that this market expansion and this build-out cycle just gets extended for quite a number of additional years. Andrew Obin : Great to hear. Thank you for a comprehensive answer. Another question, just a follow-up on capital allocation. Just buybacks, you bought back, I think, $740 million in the first half. So how should we be thinking about the cadence of buybacks for the balance of the year? Olivier Leonetti : Andrew, we see today based upon what we see in the market, a strong upside in the value of our stock. So, we will continue to buy back shares. We have said that we would buy back about 2 billion for the year. That's what the midpoint of our guide implies. But based upon where we see the stock price today, we believe we would be more at the high end of our guidance range, and we would balance this buyback between Q3 and Q4, but we will remain obviously opportunistic, Andrew. Operator : The next question is from Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Steve Tusa : Congrats on another strong print here, good execution. Just on the backlog, can that continue to grow in electrical through the rest of this year? Craig Arnold : I think it's a great question. And if you'd ask me that question at the beginning of the year, I would have imagined that we would start to see a leveling out in the backlog and perhaps even eating some backlog this year. But given how strong markets have remained, the backlog, as we talked about, up 27% year-over-year, growing still quarter-over-quarter. From where I sit today, Steve, and based upon the activities and negotiations we're seeing, my guess is we'll probably continue to build backlog. The industry as well is it's reached a level where there are some constraints today that are, quite frankly, limiting our ability to produce at the rate at which we're receiving orders. And at some point, those will certainly converge. But I would say tough to tell for sure, given the -- especially the advent of these big mega projects and what they do to your backlog, and the other dynamic that we've talked about before that's taking place in the industry is that we are having some of these big hyperscale data center customers giving us multiyear orders. So, it wouldn't surprise me at all that the back -- continue to grow. Steve Tusa : So, like sequentially for the next couple of quarters, effectively you can grow backlog for 3Q and 4Q? Craig Arnold : I think the truth is, I don't have -- I don't know I can't really give you a definitive answer. I mean the negotiations are up about 18% or so in our Electrical business. And so, we continue to grow our negotiations, and we're growing our negotiations at a faster rate than we're growing our sales. That math would suggest that it's certainly possible that we're going to continue to build backlog. But we'll just have to wait and see how it all plays out. Steve Tusa : Okay. And then just one more on the electrical margins. I think last quarter, you guys talked about some estimates hitting the margins, but here we are again with another pretty nice upside print on that front. You raised the guidance for the year, it does show a bit of a step down in incremental, still very strong in the second half, no doubt about it. What's driving the step-down in incrementals? Again, I'm not saying it's negative or anything like that. I'm just saying it's -- I want to kind of understand as things mature in the back half, what's the bit of the step down in incrementals? Craig Arnold : No, no, I appreciate that question. And without a doubt, a very strong first half of incrementals in our electrical businesses, and I'd say that lots of contributions from our team's execution. And quite frankly, we've had on a relative basis, more to higher contribution of price in the first half than we had we'll have in the second half of the year and very much consistent with what we mentioned last quarter. We are ramping spending. We have capacity coming online that brings, obviously, depreciation and obviously, the work that we need to ramp up new capacity, and we continue to make growth investments in the business, and those tend to be more heavily back and loaded. And so clearly, those margin numbers that we provided to you is our best view. But our teams have continued to surprise us as well with their execution. And so, if you think about the electrical margins, the range that we provided, I think the range is a good range, and we're hopeful that they can be at the end of the range. But at this point, that's the best view. Operator : The next question comes from the line of David Raso from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. David Raso : Electrical Americas, price cost. Can you give us some update on where we stand on that right now, particularly if you can give us any sense of volume versus price in the Electrical Americas growth, which 13% this quarter, 17% last quarter? And then also, given some of long lead times, how should we think about, as we sit here today, pricing power into 25? Craig Arnold : I appreciate the question. And I would say that certainly, as we come through this inflationary period over the last couple of years, we were a little bit upside down for a period of time on price versus cost. Today, I'd say the equation is back balanced, which means not only that are we recovering the inflation but the incrementals that we need to maintain our margins. And so probably balance today between what we'd expect to see from the business in terms of the relationship between price and cost. On volume versus pricing, as I mentioned a moment ago, Obviously, we -- pricing in the second half of the year will be less on a year-over-year basis than we saw in the first half. And that's simply a function of timing of when prices went in last year. So, it's kind of in the base already. And so, I would say today, volume versus price, specifically in terms of separating those two pieces. As we've said before, we don't provide that number, and we don't provide that number for, we think, a lot of the right reasons in terms of the variability, depending upon who the customer is and inflation varies by customer and our ability and need to recover varies by customer. So, we don't want to create an unintended problem for us is by separating the two when that number could be different from one customer versus the other. To your point on this balance between pricing power today within the business, I'd say we continue to be in an advantageous position with respect to our overall demand versus capacity. And so, I would expect as we go forward that we continue to be in an advantageous position. What we've said historically and continue to believe that we have tremendous opportunities to expand our margins by running the Company better. And as we think about the margin expansion that's in front of us and there is plenty of opportunities to expand margins every place, it will largely come from our abilities to run the Company better. David Raso : Quick follow-up. Electrical Global. The rest of the year, the revenue growth organically has to accelerate to up five after the first half was two, two and change. Is that simply the function of the easier comps in the second half? Or is there anything you're seeing that would suggest that could accelerate? Craig Arnold : No. And it's largely a function of comps. The European market, the electrical Europe market, if there's been a market that's been a little bit of a disappointment this year relative to our expectations. Coming into the year, it would have been the electrical business specifically in Europe that's embedded in our Electrical Global segment. Asia is doing great. high single-digit growth. We're doing fine in our guides business, but we have had some -- a little bit weaker results in markets specifically, and you see all the data coming out of Europe. So, we're not at all unique in that regard. But we think pretty much -- it's really a function of comps more than it is. We expect a second half turnaround in the European electrical market. Operator : The next question is from the line of Deane Dray from RBC. Please go ahead. Deane Dray : I wanted to stay in Electrical Global, if we could. And could you put the spotlight on your data center business outside of the U.S., talk about win rates and market share because -- and how much of that is in that segment today? And I would have thought that would be lifting the growth rates a little bit more. But just some color there would be helpful. Craig Arnold : Yes. I appreciate the question, Dean. I will tell you that today, very much consistent with the balance of the Eaton franchise. We don't today have as much let's say, electrical content in a data center in Europe as we would have in North America. And that's just largely a function of the share position that we have in North America and not just UPS, but in electrical switchgear in products like transformers. And so, in the North America market or in the Americas market, we have the ability to sell a complete suite of solutions end to end into data centers. And in the European market, we don't have the same strength. We have the same strength, for example, in UPS but we wouldn't have the same, let's say, position of strength in the electrical switch gear. The other thing I would add is that when you look at the data center market in Europe as a percent of the total market, it represents a much smaller share of the total business. And so those are really the factors that I'd say are really holding back the relative results of global business versus Americas one, just the breadth of the portfolio; secondly, the size of the relative market. As you know, historically, Europe has been much more focused on manufacturing and machine OEMs and automation in the data center space. Deane Dray : That's really helpful color, and thanks for that distinction. And just sticking with data center, if you think about your backlog today on your quote activity, how far out are the deliveries. Are you -- I would imagine it's over two years now, especially in transformers, but any kind of color there, please? Craig Arnold : I'd say that when you think about it, I guess it depends upon your perspective on -- I think I told to the industry in data centers is looking at perhaps as much as an eight-year backlog unless fundamentally we find a way collectively across the industry to step up what we do in building out data centers at a much faster rate. It's one of the reasons, for example, we talked about the deal that we did in Europe due to these EPODs, which is a standardized modular design, something that enables you to stand up a data center in a much shorter period of time than we have historically. So, I think the question comes, as I think about Eaton in terms of our constraints, the bigger constraints will not be what comes from Eaton. It will largely what comes from the industry and the industry's ability to find the land, to find the power, to build out the data centers at a faster rate than they have historically. So, we're going to be fine in terms of what we do. We're not going to be the bottleneck for the industry. But the industry will have challenges to keep up with this growth rate. Operator : The next question is from Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Please go ahead. Julian Mitchell : Maybe just a question on the electrical sort of products side of things. And I think that when we look at that business, for example, in the Americas, it's been fairly sluggish the last kind of nine months versus very, very high growth in systems. And there was maybe some destocking that had weighed on that that's now passed. And then to a degree, a similar phenomenon in the electrical global side with weaker products and pretty good systems growth. So, I just wondered sort of how you're thinking about that products piece from here? I think the systems revenue growth, we could sort of rightly or wrongly take for granted for a few quarters because of the very large backlogs. But products, I suppose you have this mix of easier comps in the back half, but also maybe the short-term macro numbers per the ISM this morning and so forth are worse. So maybe help us understand kind of how you see that product side of things, revenue-wise in EA and the EG playing out? Craig Arnold : Yes. I appreciate the question, Julian. And I know it's time I know [indiscernible] challenge, really got insight to what's going on in these individual markets. And as I think most of you are aware, we really don't look at our business anymore by product versus systems. We really look at it largely around the various end markets that we sell into. And to your point, Julian, there are certain end markets that we sell into that tend to be more product-centric versus system-centric. But that -- but we really do look at it by end market, if you think about an end market of resi, the residential market, which today would account for maybe 12%, 13% of our total business. That market has clearly been slow. We think we've seen some evidence of bottoming in general, but that business today comps get much easier going forward. And we think perhaps with some cuts in the federal rate, the federal funds rate that we'll see that business start to take off. But once again, it's a smaller part of the Company. The same thing could be said for what's happening today and what we call OEM, the machine builders. We do sell components into that market, and that market has been weak, especially in Europe, which tends to be more manufacturing-centric. Once again, as that market bottomed, we think so, the comps do get easier. So, let's have to wait and see. But most of our businesses, if you think about it in the context of the end markets that we sell into, be that data center, utility, industrial, commercial, institutional, which is the way we think about the business. We're not seeing any sluggishness. And obviously, whatever sluggishness we're seeing in these smaller pieces of the portfolio are being more than offset and overwhelmed by the mega trends and what's going on in the biggest part of our business. So hopefully, that's helpful to you in terms of as we think about it, it's really if you want a proxy for products and the way you think about it, it's what's happening in resi and what's happening and, let's call it, MOEM, machinery OEMs would be probably the best two proxies for products inside of Eaton. Yes, it has been slow. Maybe we're reaching a bottom, comps do get easier going forward. Julian Mitchell : And then just a more sort of short-term question looking at maybe margins for a second. So, I think the guidance seems to imply sort of midpoints and so on and where there's some rounding no doubt. But it seems to imply the operating margins are sort of flattish sequentially in Q3, I think, and then sort of flat year-on-year. And then in Q4, it looks like they're sort of flattish again sequentially. So just trying to understand that because I suppose normally the operating margin goes up sequentially, Q3 down sequentially in Q4. And then as we're thinking year-on-year, I understand your investments are stepping up a bit, so that's crimping the firm-wide operating leverage in Q3. And but it's sort of interesting that the margins are guided to be flat despite the 8%, 9% growth. Craig Arnold : Yes. What I would tell you, we talked about this a little bit already, Julian, is that we are investing. We are bringing on additional manufacturing capacity, and that brings on, obviously, start-up expenses. It brings on depreciation. We are investing in commercial front-end resources to essentially deal with the growth that we're seeing. And so yes, I mean, margins on balance in the back half of the year, flat. We'll see where we end up. but that's essentially our current view. And our team continues to execute as well as they have, there could be some upside there, but it's our current view from where we sit today. Operator : The next question is from Nicole DeBlase from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Nicole DeBlase : So, another really strong set of results. I guess maybe the one blip was Aerospace margin down year-on-year. I guess I'm a bit surprised that you maintained the full year guidance. It embeds a pretty big step-up in second half. So, can you just talk about what happened with Aero margins in the second quarter? And then what drives the implied step up in the back half? Craig Arnold : Yes. I appreciate the question, Nicole. And I would just say that in Aerospace, margins can be lumpy. And that's largely because there's such a big difference between margins in aftermarket and margins on OEs and which OE platform do you ship and how much in a given quarter. So, I would just say -- I would just think about it as noise. We're confident in the second half outlook is based upon essentially orders that we have in-house and have pretty clear visibility. So, we're confident in the outlook, and I would just look through the noise in the quarter and attribute it largely to -- yes, we had some operating inefficiencies in the quarter. They will go away, but mostly, it's a function of mix that we shipped in a given quarter that really drives the margin outlook. Nicole DeBlase : Got it. That makes sense, Craig. And then I guess on the NordicEPOD investment, is there opportunity to bring that modular solution to the U.S.? Or do you view that as more as a European-centric opportunity? Craig Arnold : Yes. We'll have to see how the North American market evolves. I mean, modular solutions. We see it in Europe for sure. We see it in Asia, two regions of the world where we're seeing more of this modular approach to data center build-outs. The U.S., especially the hyperscale customers tend to be more specific and customized in their build. So, we'll have to wait and see how that plays out. But as of today, it does tend to be more what's taking place outside of the U.S. versus what's in the U.S. Operator : And the next question is from Scott Davis from Melius Research. Please go ahead. Scott Davis : Congrats on the results. [indiscernible] the last couple of years. Craig, a couple of kind of small things. I mean you quote the 40% win rate. I don't recall what that was historically, but if you went back like five years or something, would it be in that ballpark? Is this meaningfully higher than that than maybe where you guys were historically? Craig Arnold : Yes. I would say that the win rate, and once again, we're relatively early, right, in mega projects overall, with some 15% of them having started. And so, it's a good start at 40%, and that would be higher than our underlying market share in North America. And so clearly, we're encouraged by the start that we're seeing it. And -- but I would say, in general, the bigger and the more complex project in general, the more likelihood that Eaton is going to win and our market share in general tends to be higher in larger, more sophisticated projects. Scott Davis : Yes. That makes a lot of sense. And then Craig, not that anybody is chasing you out the door, you've done an amazing job, but any update on the CEO succession? Craig Arnold : No. I'll just say thank you, first and all for the acknowledgment. It's been a pleasure, and it will continue to be a pleasure. As everybody on the call is probably aware, we have a mandatory retirement age of 65. I'll turn 65 in May of next year, and I'll leave at the end of May. In the meantime, continuing to enjoy the job and having a lot of fun and I can't think of a better time by the way to be in my chair and be a part of these industries that we're associated with. But the Board is very busy working on that particular question. And we certainly we'll announce things as soon as the Board is ready to share their feedback and their decision on who's going to be the next leader. Operator : The next question is from Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Nigel Coe : Craig, what an amazing career you've had. So, I know you're not leaving. This is not the last call, but also I just want to acknowledge you've done a fantastic job here. So, on the investment spending, the $1 billion, 2 million square feet of additional capacity, can you just remind us where are we in that ramp up? When does that capacity come online? And I know it's coming on in sequences, but can you just give us a sense there. And this investment spend sort of sequentially in Electrical Americas. Is that mainly depreciation? Or are there some other cash expenses to think about as well? Craig Arnold : Yes. So, the first question around when, and I'd say, really, I would tell you that it really starts beginning in the second half of this year, where some of the investments that we announced in the early part of that $750 million North America spend. It really starts to come online this year. Some of the other investments that tend to be a little longer term maybe towards the end or so of next year or even some into 2026. But I'd say it really does begin beginning in the second half of the year. where we're adding capacity that allows us to obviously address the overall market demand and some of the backlog efficacy. I'm not sure I understood the second part of the question, though. Maybe, Nigel, you can [indiscernible] [Multiple Speakers]? Nigel Coe : Yes, just -- yes, so the spending, the kind of the investment headwinds in Electrical Americas that you're referencing, is that a depreciation on this new capacity? Or are there other investments that we should think about as well? Craig Arnold : Yes. No, there's certainly -- it's depreciation and then it's also the ramp-up cost, right, when you ramp up a new manufacturing facility or a new line, there's obviously inefficiencies that you have to absorb until these lines come up and reach their targeted capacity levels. And so, there's manufacturing inefficiencies, it's depreciation. And then the investments that we're making in our commercial front end to really address some of this growth that we're seeing both now and into the future. Nigel Coe : Okay. My follow-up question is, I guess, related in some ways, but the announcement by Cleveland-Cliffs, can't believe I actually mentioned Cleveland-Cliffs on this call, but they have announced a transformer manufacturing investment of $150 million three-phase transformers, which I thought was kind of random, but I'd be interested to kind of get your view here in terms of kind of a new entrant in this market kind of how much capacity are we seeing coming online in transformers? And how long do you think this market is going to be undersupplied for? I mean are we still undersupplied for the next couple of years? I mean any thoughts there would be great. Craig Arnold : Yes. I mean, we obviously saw the announcement as well from Cleveland-Cliffs. I mean they have not historically been a supplier to transformers it into the market. They, at one point, had rumored to be partnering with another transformer manufacturer in that investment. I can just tell you, based upon the size of the investment and what we know about transformer manufacturing, we're not worried about Cleveland-Cliffs and what amounts to a very modest investment in transformer manufacturing. So, we're not -- we've seen it. but we're not worried about it. I don't think it's going to have any impact at all on our growth rate and very little of any impact on the industry given the size of the investment. And how long? I'd say that we talk about these trends. And as you can imagine, transformers go everywhere. I mean they go into data centers. They go into industrial buildings that go into utility applications. And so, transformer demand that we're seeing today is comprehensive across every one of our end markets. And I would imagine what they're doing is focusing perhaps on maybe one of these verticals, I'm not sure. But I don't see transformer demand and capacity coming into alignment for a number of years. I think that market is going to be good for a long time, and we'll have to wait until it all plays out. But our markets as we've articulated, are expected to continue to see very attractive growth for a long time for now. Operator : Our next question is from Joe O'Dea from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Joe O\u2019Dea: Actually, on that topic, Greg, could you just provide a little bit more detail on the $750 million of spend on capacity in the Americas. Any perspective on some of the categories that are going to see some of the biggest capacity addition. And so, what will be the step up in your transformer capacity, anything on switchgear capacity just to better sort of understand where there's some of the more sizable investments. Craig Arnold : Yes. I think the right way to think about that is that we're making the investments in those product lines, and there's obviously a chart in the outbound commentary around the various businesses that are going to be impacted. But every place that we have capacity constraints today or where we see capacity constraints over the next few years, we're making investments, and we're making those investments in line with our and our customers medium and long-term outlook for what the demand will be. And including, as I mentioned, in many cases, getting customer commitments for the capacity that we're bringing online. And so, lots of different products, lots of different businesses. It's difficult to really perhaps answer the question as precisely as you've asked it, other than to say, we're making the needed investments as I said in the last earnings call, we don't intend to be a bottleneck for the industry in terms of our capacity to support the growth outlook. And we're comfortable what we're spending and where we're spending it. Joe O\u2019Dea: And then I just want to ask on backlog. If you go back last quarter, the backlog expected to ship in the next 12 months was up like $2 billion or 20% sequentially. And so just curious in terms of meeting that demand, how much of that is dependent on capacity that would be coming on in the back half of the year? And then any specifics, the order activity and the end markets that, that was directed into with that $2 billion increase in the next 12 months backlog. Craig Arnold : Yes. That's another difficult question to really piece that together in terms of how much of the specific backlog is tied to the capacity expansion. The backlog is obviously quite large and the backlog cuts across every one of our businesses, some of which or getting additional capacity, some of which are not. So, difficult to really answer that question maybe in a satisfactory way to really address that other than to say, once again, where we have capacity constraints, where lead times have stretched beyond what we think are reasonable and we're making those investments to get out in front of it so that we can deliver -- reduce our lead times to customers and can continue to grow. But difficult to really answer that question in the context of these investments other than to say that if you think about it -- and these are the incremental investments. On a relative basis, most of the backlog, most of the backlog is not tied to these capacity investments, right? We talk about adding 2 million square feet of capacity impacting 25 of our sites, we have north of 100 sites. So, I would just say that most of the investments or most of the backlog is obviously going to be satisfied by our facilities where we don't necessarily need to add capacity, but we have some real tight spots in some of the businesses, and that's what we're addressing. Operator : And the final question in queue is from Phil Buller from Berenberg. Please go ahead. Philip Buller : You used to talk, Craig, about an investment or portfolio strategy of, I think it was growing the head and shrinking the tail. I think that was the phrase you used to use, but essentially throwing all the weight of investment dollars behind the most attractive end markets and dining back or exiting the least attractive part. And obviously, that's worked really well. I think it's clear today what the best bits are. But is there much happening now on the tail, is there a tail? Or are there any less strategic parts of the business where we might expect potential disposals? Craig Arnold : No, I appreciate the question. And the short answer is absolutely, there's a tail and there's a tail everywhere. We posted close to 30% margins in our Electrical Americas business this quarter. The Electrical Americas business has a tail. And so, I would tell you that the way we really think about this is that every one of our business leaders has to be a portfolio manager. They have to be looking at products, applications, customers, markets where we don't make the returns don't have the right growth prospects and they'll be actively addressing that. And the inverse is also true, by the way. There's a head too. There's places where we ought to be doubling down and in making incremental investments and really playing the win because we have the right technology, the right to win, great margins, great growth industries. And so, I think the short answer is, absolutely. We continue to do portfolio management every place, and there's opportunities every place across the Company to be more focused in the places that we decide to play and where we think we can win. Philip Buller : And just to follow up, I guess, an extension of that question. Broadly speaking, what's your current assessment of the attractiveness of commercial aerospace? I get that backlogs are high, traffic is secular and so on. But airlines are profit warning daily at the moment. It seems, Airbus and Boeing have a lot of their own challenges to ramp up. I know it's an attractive long-term industry, but what's your evolving view on the sort of three-year view on commercial aerospace and its relative attractiveness versus the wider portfolio? Craig Arnold : I certainly appreciate the question, right, given today, some of the challenges that some of the OEMs are having, why you'd asked the question in terms of how we feel about it? But I can tell you, we think the aerospace, commercial aerospace industry is an outstanding industry in the short, medium and long term. And why? It has all of the characteristics of businesses we like. It's a business that pays for technology, it's a business where you can differentiate. It's a business that has a very large aftermarket. It's a business that has a wide moat where if you're on a platform, you on a platform for life. It is a long-term growth industry, and it's an industry where we make very attractive returns. And so, despite the fact that maybe one of the customer or two is going through a little bit of a short-term issue, the growth outlook for commercial aerospace continues to be one of the best growth outlooks that we have in the Company. Aftermarket continues to be very attractive. And so no, we like the space, and we like the fundamentals, and we think it's a very attractive asset. Yan Jin : Okay. Great. Thanks, guys. We've reached the end of our call, and I appreciate everybody's questions. As always, the IR team is ready to any follow-up questions. Thanks for joining us. Have a great day. Operator : Thank you. And that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and using AT&T teleconference. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Yan Jin. Please go ahead. Yan Jin : Hey, good morning. Thank you all for joining us for Eaton's third quarter 2024 earnings call. With me today are Craig Arnold, our Chairman and CEO; and Olivier Leonetti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our agenda today includes operating remarks by Craig, then he will turn it over to Oliver who will highlight the company's performance in the third quarter. As we have done in our past calls, we'll be taking questions at the end of Craig's closing commentary. The press release and the presentation we'll go through today have been posted on our website. This presentation, including adjusted earnings per share, adjusted free cash flow and other non-GAAP measures. They are reconciled in the appendix. A webcast of this call is accessible on our website and will be available for replay. I would like to remind you that our comments today will including statements related to the expected future results of the company and are therefore forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our forecasted projection due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and the presentation. With that, I will turn it over to Craig. Craig Arnold : Thanks, Yan. We'll start on Page 3 where we summarize the key highlights of another strong quarter. We generated adjusted EPS of $2.84 a share, an all-time record and up 15% from prior year. We also delivered record segment margins of 24.3%, up 70 basis points from last year and we're raising our guidance for segment margins and adjusted EPS for the year. We did experience a couple of extraordinary events in the quarter that impacted our revenue. First, the widely publicized strike taking place in the aerospace industry and then Hurricane Helene which impacted several of our Electrical Americas factories at the end of the quarter. While both of these events will have an impact on our revenue outlook for Q4, they're not impacting our demand and its only timing. In fact, our markets continue to be strong on a rolling 12 month basis. Electrical orders were up 12% with Electrical Americas orders up 16% and aerospace orders increased by 6%. This led to another quarter of growing and record backlog, up 26% for Electrical Americas, up 14% for aerospace, with strong book-to-bill ratios. On balance, we're pleased with our results, well-positioned for a record year of performance, and expect to carry strong momentum into 2025. Turning to Page 4, we once again are sharing our overview of megatrends and how they're driving growth in our end markets. I think the key message here is one of breadth, both in the number of megatrends and in the number of our end markets that are positively impacted, something we think is unique to Eaton and will allow us to grow at an accelerated rate for years to come. Last quarter, we provided an end market update on our commercial and institutional segment, highlighting the strong growth outlook for institutional and infrastructure markets. Today, we intend to provide a forecast of residential markets and how energy transition is creating new growth opportunities in residential homes. And as we've done in recent earnings calls, we'll also provide an update on the growing number of mega projects announced during the quarter. So let's begin with that on Slide 5 in the presentation. This chart shows a summary of megaprojects that have been announced since January of 2021 in North America. As a reminder, a megaproject is a project with an announced value of $1 billion or more. Through Q3, we're now at 504 projects with a cumulative value of $1.6 trillion and the backlog now stands at $1.8 trillion, up 30% from last year. I'd also point out the announcements are continuing to accelerate with Q3 up 48% versus Q2. Approximately 16% of these projects have started and we expect a record number of starts in 2025. Many of you have asked the questions about cancellations, which we continue to monitor as well. To-date, cancellations have been modest, around 10% and well below historical levels. For projects that have started, we've won over $1.7 billion of orders and our win rate is almost 40%. Of note, we're in active negotiations on another $3 billion of orders, up 175% from last quarter. While mega projects continue to garner a lot of attention, deservedly so, the Dodge Momentum Index, which tracks commercial and institutional projects that are less than $500 million are also at record levels of 22% in the quarter. Taken together, we think they provide a strong validation of the megatrends and support our view on the long-term outlook of our end markets. As we prepare for the growth ahead, we're making investments in our manufacturing capacity naturally. And on Slide 6, we show an update of our incremental capacity investments, which now stand at $1.5 billion, up $500 million from our previous estimate. The increase reflects our increasing confidence in our outlook as well as increasing demand that we're now seeing in data center markets. These multi-year investments with the largest addition coming in the second half of 2025 and 2026. And the capacity investments cover several product families and importantly, can be used across most of the electrical end markets. I'd also add that most of the additional capacity is what we consider right assembly and modular, which allows us to be both flexible and efficient as we deploy capital. Overall, our expansion projects are on track with a number of sites starting to ramp up production. For example, we recently opened a 110,000 square meter facility in Juarez, Mexico that produces motor controllers and switchboards. And we also opened a new manufacturing facility in the Dominican Republic that will increase our supply of Bussmann fuses. Next on Slide 7, we're highlighting our residential markets, which include naturally, the electrical infrastructure for both new construction and renovation. Residential markets represent 6% of Eaton's total sales and 8% of electrical sales. And the key message here is that these secular trends that we've been talking about that are impacting our industrial and commercial markets are also impacting homes, as a result, the electrical content in homes continues to grow. The growth in solar, electric vehicles, energy storage and the electrification of heating and cooking are fundamentally changing the requirements in home. And new safety codes and standards are also continuing to drive the need for higher electrical content. And as you know, the current IRA tax incentives for electrical panel upgrades are designed to support this growing need for more electrical power. No doubt, residential markets have been feeling the impact of higher interest rates over the last couple of years. With markets now feeling like they've reached a bottom, the housing shortage remains, and we should see positive growth from this point forward, estimated at a 6% CAGR over the next four years from what's been a drag on growth over the last 24 months should turn positive now. With the -- and within the residential market, Eaton is especially well-positioned. As homes become more electrified, to generate and sometimes sell electrical power, become bigger consumers of electricity, they also need to become smarter. We address these changes in our everything as a grid, including homes slide, which we show on Slide 8. For more than a century, power has flowed in one direction from central power plants into homes. Today, there's a new reality. Thanks to the addition of solar power, electric vehicles, energy storage, all on the top of the need to run a more electrified home. In simple terms, homes can now act as energy hubs, producing their own power, managing their electrical loads and selling power back to their local utility, all of which requires more sophisticated electrical equipment. Eaton's home-as-a-grid approach creates smart energy systems that allow homeowners to reduce costs, participate in demand response programs, improved resiliency, including islanding from the grid and to optimize the home by selecting which electrical loads they want to run during a power outage. So in addition to homes requiring more electrical power, homes now require -- are now required to be more intelligent, to be connected and to be integrated into a home-as-a-grid solution. Today's fully grid-ready homes have up to 5x the electrical content of a traditional home, a trend that will only increase over time and a tremendous opportunity for Eaton. One example of how we're implementing our home-as-a-grid strategy can be seen in the recently announced collaboration with Tesla. As you know, one of the biggest names in energy storage, and they needed a solution that would allow homeowners and installers to simplify the integration of energy storage, solar and load management in the home. This is especially important in the existing home market of more than 40 million homes with only 100-amp service. Eaton's first-to-market in what we call AbleEdge smart breakers provide homeowners with intelligent load management capabilities. This technology allows homeowners to turn their standard loads into a smart load center without replacing the electrical panel. Together with our partners, our systems will manage your solar, your energy storage and your electrical loads. And it's simple to install. It provides better functionality and at a much lower cost than other solutions. In fact, we estimate our solution will be 3x to 5x lower cost. Our AbleEdge smart breakers will be available in early 2025, and we look forward to growing our partnership with Tesla. Now, I'll turn it over to Olivier to take us through the financial results for the quarter. Olivier Leonetti : Thanks, Craig. I'll start by providing a summary of our Q3 results, in which we once again set many new records. We posted third quarter record sales of $6.3 billion, up 8% both in total and organically. However, revenue was negatively impacted by about $50 million from Hurricane Helene and labor strikes in the aerospace industry. Without these impacts, organic growth would have been above our 8.5% guidance midpoint. Operating profit grew 11% and segment margin expanded 70 basis points to 24.3%. Adjusted EPS of $2.84 increased by 15% over the prior year. This is a quarterly record and above the high end of our guidance range. This performance resulted in all-time record cash flow performance, including operating cash flow of $1.3 billion, up 15% on a year-over-year basis and free cash flow of $1.1 billion, up 23% versus prior year. On Slide 11, we summarize another very strong quarter for Electrical Americas. Before we go through the results, we want to acknowledge the significant impact that Hurricane Helene had on our employees and their communities. Electrical Americas employ more than 3,000 people in North and South Carolina in nine facilities and the safety of our team members is our top priority. We have continued to provide support to our employees, their families, and affected communities, including providing essentials and financial assistance. We are pleased to report that our facilities are back up and running to support all the strong consumer demand we are seeing in our markets. Despite these challenges, we set a new record for sales, operating profit and margins. Organic sales growth increased to 14%, reflecting strength in data center, commercial, and institutional and utility end markets. On two-year stack, organic growth was up 33%. Electrical Americas has generated double-digit growth -- organic growth for 11 consecutive quarters. Operating margin of 13.1% was up 240 basis points versus prior year, benefiting from higher sales and increased operational efficiencies that were partially offset by higher costs to support growth initiatives. On a rolling 12-month basis, orders reaccelerated to 16% from 11% last quarter, demonstrating continued tailwinds from the various megatrends. We had particular strength in the data center market where activity is increasingly robust. For example, Dodge data shows U.S. enhanced data center project starts are up 81% year-to-date nine months, surpassing 2023 levels in Q3 of 2024. With data center construction backlog is now estimated to extend out about nine years based on 2023 build rates. Also, our major project negotiation pipeline is up approximately 60% year-to-date through nine months. Electrical Americas backlog increased 26% year-over-year with a book-to-bill ratio of 1.2 on a rolling 12-month basis. These results underscore the tailwinds from secular trends, strong execution and robust backlog that have allowed us to raise our guidance for the year, which we'll discuss later in the presentation. Next chart summarizes the results of our Electrical Global segment. Total revenue growth was of 5% included organic growth of 4% and FX tailwind of 1%. We had strength in data center and utility markets partially offset by weakness in residential markets. Regionally, we saw continued strength in APAC with double-digit organic growth and mid-single-digit organic growth in EMEA. Operating margin of 18.7% was generally in line with our expectations for the quarter and down 310 basis points versus prior year, primarily driven by a real estate transaction in 2023. Orders were up 6% on a rolling 12-month basis with strength in data center utility and MOEM markets. Backlog increased 19% over prior year and book-to-bill continues to remain strong. Q3 was 1.1 on a rolling 12-month basis. Before moving to our Industrial businesses, I'd like to briefly recap the combined electrical segments. For Q3, we posted organic growth of 11% and segment margin of 26.2%, which was up 70 basis points over prior year. On a rolling 12-month basis, orders were up 12% and book-to-bill ratios for our electrical sector remains strong at 1.1. We remain confident in our positioning for continued growth with strong margins in our overall electrical business. Page 13 highlights our Aerospace segment. We posted Q3 record sales, and all-time record operating profit. Total growth was 9%, including organic growth of 8% for the quarter driven by strength in commercial OEM, commercial aftermarket, and defense aftermarket. Operating margin was strong at 24.4%, up 30 basis points year-over-year and also up 290 basis points sequentially, which was driven by higher sales and mix. On a rolling 12-month basis, orders increased 6% driven by strength in commercial OEM, commercial aftermarket, and defense aftermarket. Year-over-year backlog increased 14% and was up 4% sequentially. On a rolling 12-month basis, our book-to-bill for our Aerospace segment remains strong at 1.1. And we are pleased with $2.3 billion Life of Program wins so far this year. Moving to our Vehicle segment on Page 14. In the quarter, total revenue was down 7%, including a 6% organic decline, primarily driven by weakness in the light vehicle market and 1 point of unfavorable effects. Operating margin came up at 19.4%, 200 basis points above prior year, driven by improved operating efficiencies. We have made progress here to increase margins, which this quarter exceeded our mid-term target of 19%. And we are pleased to have won $75 million in mature year sales in Q3 across our commercial and passenger vehicle portfolio. On Page 15, we show results for our e-mobility business. Sales were up 2%, including organic growth of 1% from slower OEM new product launches and weakness consumer demand. Operating loss was $7 million, and as we continue to incur launch costs related to new programs. Moving to Page 16, we show our electrical and aerospace backlog updated through Q3. We continue to build backlog with electrical stepping up to $11.8 billion and Aerospace reaching $3.7 billion for a total backlog of $15.5 billion versus prior year our backlogs have grown by 25% in Electrical and 14% in Aerospace. Electrical backlog benefited from acceleration in order intake from tailwinds of the secular trends, including hyperscale orders within the data center end market. As noted earlier, book-to-bill ratios from Electrical and Aerospace are 1.1 and 1.1, respectively. The continued growth in our backlog underscores our confidence in 2024 and beyond. Now, I will turn it back to Craig for financial guidance updates and our initial thoughts on 2025. Craig Arnold : Thanks, Olivier. Turning to Page 17, we summarize our fiscal year organic growth and operating margin guidance with less than a quarter ago, we've made a number of adjustments to provide our best forecast on how we expect to close the year. Overall, we continue to expect our 2024 organic growth to be between 8% and 9%. However, with the continuing aerospace industry labor strikes and the slowdown in vehicle markets, we now expect our revenue growth to be on the low end of our range. We're raising our organic growth guidance in Electrical Americas by 100 basis points to 13% to 14% from 11.5% to 13.5%. We're lowering the range of our aerospace business by 150 basis points due to the labor strike. We're also lowering our vehicle business to -- from down 3% to 5% to down to -- from flat to down 4% and in e-mobility to 5% to 7% growth from 17% to 23% growth given the widely reported industry weakness and outlook. For segment margins, we're increasing the company's margin guidance range by 20 basis points to 23.7% at the mid-point of our guidance. This is driven primarily by the outlook in our Electrical Americas business, where we're increasing our margin outlook by 70 basis points at the mid-point to 29.6% and vehicle where we're increasing our margin outlook by 150 basis points at the mid-point to 18%. We're also lowering our margin outlook for Electrical Global, aerospace and e-mobility by 90, 50 and 150 basis points, respectively. In total, the company is well-positioned to continue to deliver strong financial performance and to close out the year well. On Page 18, we list our additional guidance metrics for 2024 in Q4. For 2024, our adjusted EPS is expected to be between $10.75 and $10.81 a share, the $10.78 mid-point represents 18% growth in adjusted EPS, an $0.08 raise over our prior guide and is also a $0.63 increase versus our original guidance for the year. For Q4, we expect organic growth to be between 6% and 7%, segment margins to be between 23.6% and 24%, and adjusted EPS in the range of $2.78 to $2.84 a share. We do expect Hurricane Helene and the labor strike in aerospace industry to have an impact on our Q4 revenue and it's embedded in our guidance already. As I noted, while we have reaffirmed the full year organic growth range of 8% to 9%, based upon the impact from Hurricane Helene and labor strikes in Aerospace, we expect to be at the low end of the range. The impact from the Hurricane Helene is behind us and all of our sites are now up and running. The aerospace industry strike is still ongoing, and while they could have an impact on our revenues based upon what's in our outlook, we don't expect an impact in our EPS. If we can shift your attention to 2025, on Page 19, we provide our initial view on end market growth expectations for next year. As you can see here, we anticipate attractive growth in nearly all of our markets. We're expecting double-digit growth in data centers, in distributed IT, commercial aerospace and electric vehicles, solid growth in utility, and modest growth across most of our other end markets. Commercial vehicle is the only market that's projected to decline. So overall, 2025 should be another year of significant growth with more than 90% of our end markets seeing positive growth. And as you know, our own growth outlook is supported by a strong order book, record backlogs, and secular trends that continue to be favorable. We will provide our revenue forecast in February but we do expect to grow faster than our end markets. The company is well-positioned to deliver differentiated growth in 2025 and we think beyond. While we'll provide more details in February, we did want to provide some initial assumptions for our 2025 guidance. Based upon the last chart, we expect our end markets in total to grow between 6% and 8% and for our incremental margins to be between 30% and 35%. Due to high interest expense and lower pension income, we anticipate roughly a $0.20 headwind on below the cost -- below the line items and a tax rate of approximately 18%. Our multi-year restructuring program costs are expected to be approximately $50 million, with $75 million of savings. And we expect capital spending to be roughly between $900 million and $1 billion. Lastly, we continue to repurchase shares, and we're estimating the number to be approximately $2 billion. While we're still in the early phases of our planning, we also expect another strong year of earnings growth. So let me close on Page 21. Once again, the trends driving growth in our end market continue to play out as expected and even better in our Electrical Americas business, driven by data center markets and the reindustrialization trend that we're seeing across multiple industries. We also delivered a strong quarter of financial results and continue to see outstanding execution on our key initiatives across the company. As a result, we've raised our guidance for segment margins by 20 basis points and our EPS by $0.08 at the mid-point. And in the quarter, we're especially pleased to see the strength in our negotiations, our orders, and the growth in our backlog, all of which are at record levels, validating our medium and long-term growth outlook. So we leave the quarter with a high level of confidence when we say Eaton will deliver higher growth, higher margins and consistent earnings growth and improving free cash flow for years to come. And with that, I will open things up for questions that you may have. Thank you. Yan Jin : Thanks, Craig. For the Q&A today, please limit your opportunity just to one question and one follow-up. Thanks everyone for your cooperation. With that, I'll turn it over to the operator to give you guys the instructions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line from Andrew Obin from Bank of America. Andrew Obin : Yes. So it wouldn't be an Eaton call without a data center question. So maybe if you could give us more detail on how did your data center business perform on organic growth orders and negotiations pipeline in the third quarter? Thank you. Craig Arnold : No, Andrew, we appreciate the question and as has been widely reported, the data center market just continues to perform much better than even we imagined. In the quarter itself, our data center sales were up 35%, our net, by the way, up from 27% in the prior quarter. So the rate of growth is accelerating. Our orders were up some 55% on a rolling 12-month basis, and negotiations are up 90%. And so as you can tell from this data, we just continue to build strong momentum in the data center market. And as we've said, we think that market is going to be very strong for years to come. Andrew Obin : Terrific. And just a follow-up question. You have sort of highlighted the hurricane, and I understand that you do have presence in the Carolinas, that's why we're highlighting. But maybe if you could put a finer point on the impact in the third quarter and how much of an impact do you expect in the fourth quarter? You did say that it's past you, but just is there any lingering impact in the fourth quarter that you're willing to quantify. Thank you. Craig Arnold : No. I appreciate that question as well, Andrew. And as I think most of the investors know we have a fairly sizable footprint in the Carolinas. In fact, we have some 3,000 employees in multiple facilities that were actually in the path of the storm. Pleased to report that our facilities are all back up and running. All of our employees have been accounted for and safe. And so while it certainly was a bit of a challenge at the end of the quarter and at the beginning of this quarter, it's all behind us now, and the business and the sites are actually performing quite well. So yes, without a doubt, what I'd tell you is that the Americas put up really strong results in Q3, they could have been stronger, but for the hurricane. And certainly, it's shaving a little bit of growth off of the revenue for the Electrical Americas business in the fourth quarter as well. But it just went into backlog. This is not lost business. This is simply timing. As you saw from our orders growth in the quarter and the backlog growth in the quarter, we will certainly realize that revenue. It's just timing. And if I can just for a minute here, recognize our team, our team just did an extraordinary job of supporting our employees and supporting the community providing shelter, food, generators. Our team just rose to the occasion and we'd all be very proud of the way they represented our company in this moment of need and crisis for both our employees and the community. Operator : Thank you. One moment, for our next question. We'll now take a call from Nigel Coe at Wolfe Research. Nigel Coe : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Craig Arnold : Good morning, Nigel. Nigel Coe : And Craig thanks for the 2025 early indications. Just a question, I think, for maybe Olivier. On the Electrical Americas margins, obviously, you tend to be a little bit considerate here, but I think 4Q does tick down a little bit from 3Q. So seasonally, normally, we see a little bit higher, so just a question there. But the broader question would be, we've seen a huge amount of operating leverage in the Americas. We got some investment spending. How do we think about operating leverage and margin potential going forward? Within that 30%, 35% sort of construct, do you think the Americas can be above that level going forward? Olivier Leonetti : Thank you for your question, Nigel. We are very pleased with the performance of our Electrical Americas business, both on the top-line and the margin. To answer to your question directly, we do not believe we have reached our maximum potential. We still believe we have room for improvement. I would mention three levers : one, operating leverage on higher volume growth; two, improving of our manufacturing efficiencies in both our existing and new facilities; and finally, as you know, we have a restructuring program ongoing, and those programs should deliver improvement in margin for the America. Also, you haven't asked the question, but we believe we have margin opportunities. We discussed that before in our Electrical Global business, but as well in our Aerospace business, Nigel. Nigel Coe : Okay. Great. Any comments on 4Q would be helpful. But my follow-up question is around the 2025 framework. You said 6% to 8% end market growth in 2025. I think you've got an ambition to outgrow your end markets by about 2 points. So do we think about kind of starting framework for next year, 6% to 8% or maybe a little bit higher than that? Craig Arnold : I appreciate that question. And you're absolutely correct, we do have both an ambition and an expectation that our business will grow -- businesses will grow faster than their end markets. And as you can imagine, it's still very early, and we're still working through our planning for 2025. And you can expect that we'll provide a framework for you, more details as we get to the Q4 earnings call next year. And obviously, Paulo, will lay out a more wholesome mid and long-term strategic framework for you at our investor meeting in Q1 next year. So -- but to your question specifically, we should expect to outgrow end markets the exact magnitude of which we're not prepared to say at this point as we're still working through our internal plans. Operator : Thank you. We will now take a call from Jeffrey Sprague from Vertical Research Partners. Jeffrey Sprague : Good morning. Lot going on today, interesting times. I wonder, Craig, if you could talk a little bit about capital deployment, it looks like with what you're saying on the share repo, you're quite comfortable just to continue to put up the organic growth and buy back stock. But the nature of my question is right, liquid cooling is getting more and more attention on the data center side, Schneider making a sizable bet, Vertiv there. You've got some kind of alliance or kind of partnership, so I know you're sort of on the periphery of this anyhow. But maybe just speak to, do you view that as an important part of your offering or where else you might have holes that might need to be filled from an M&A standpoint? Craig Arnold : No, I appreciate the question, Jeff. And obviously, to your point, data centers as a market is getting a lot of attention and cooling as a space is also one of our hot topics. I'd say to us, if you think about it just more broadly around growth, we have growth opportunities everywhere. We talked about these numbers in our own data center business growing 35% in the quarter, 90% increase in negotiations. And so we have just tremendous opportunities to grow in data center and in other markets without looking at an adjacency like cooling, I'm not saying that we would never consider doing something more deliberate there, but it is not required in any way for us to continue to post just significant growth and continue to win in the data center market. And so what I would tell you today is that we're focusing on organic growth. We're focusing on essentially executing well against the opportunities in front of us. Our deal pipeline in general, to the broader question around capital deployment is certainly good today. And certainly, the pipeline is growing with opportunities, and those opportunities are coming from lots of different areas. But certainly, data centers for us is a key market that we're focused on. Jeffrey Sprague : And then, speaking of capital deployment, just on the CapEx side. Is the additional CapEx still oriented towards those kind of big pinch points of transformers and switch gear? Or is this sort of broadening out into other parts of the portfolio that are just looking tight given kind of the growth that you see in front of you? Craig Arnold : As I mentioned in my commentary, the incremental investment, we talked about $1 billion of incremental CapEx investment in the last earnings call, we've now taken that number up to $1.5 billion. And a lot of that increment is, in fact, going into these kinds of markets, data centers, transformers some of these markets where we've just seen even faster growth than what we originally anticipated. And quite frankly, we're having customers come to us asking us to make multi-year commitments and signing up for multi-year agreements to provide their requirements and their needs. And so for us, it's just indicative of the underlying strength that we're seeing in our business and our willingness to invest. I mean this is a case where the risk today is much more on the side of under investing, not overinvesting. Operator : Thank you. One moment, for our next question. We'll now take a call from Chris Snyder at Morgan Stanley. Chris Snyder : Thank you and appreciate all the color on the outlook. Maybe if I could ask on the mega projects. I think it's pretty surprising to see that only 16% of the $1.6 trillion have started. I guess, does that similarly suggest that around maybe 85% or 84% of the orders related to these projects are still on the horizon. And then I know you guys said that the cancellation of these projects is below historical levels. But are they progressing more slowly in that, the lag between announcement and order has extended versus maybe what we thought a couple of years ago? Thank you. Craig Arnold : Yes. No, I think, Chris, you got it for the most part, right, in terms of the 16% of the projects have started, and that does mean 84% or so of the projects are still out into the future. And so that's a pretty straightforward math. And to the point around cancellations, yes, I mean they're running at roughly 10%, and there's always been cancellations in these big mega projects historically. And we tried to provide some color on how that 10% relates to historical cancellations, and it's lower. And so bigger projects, more projects, and lower cancellation rates, which is why we're so bullish on the growth. And in terms of the progression question specifically, and as you see in the data, the progression for us continues to look really, really positive. The numbers continue to grow quite dramatically, up 175% in terms of the quarter-over-quarter. I will tell you that there's obviously always a question around the industry's capacity and the ability to digest all of these projects in the timeframe that they'd like, is there going to be enough labor. You've heard the debate in data centers? Is there going to be enough power? And so what you might end up with, quite frankly, is just an extended longer cycle in the process overall. But these projects are generally pretty diverse as well. I mean they really -- they're cutting through in the early days. It was a lot of projects that were EV and battery. What we've seen in the last -- pivot in the last quarter is a lot of commercial and institutional projects, a lot of data center projects, a lot of power projects. And so just a broad base of different projects that are being essentially announced and we're certainly hopeful that that turns into starts next year, which we think are going to be up nicely and a long-term growth outlook. Chris Snyder : I appreciate that. And then, maybe transitioning over to data center. Could you maybe just talk a little bit about Eaton's relationships with the big hyperscalers? And as those companies get better clarity on their forward CapEx plans and Eaton brings more capacity to market, does that change the way that you can enter into commercial agreements with those customers? Thank you. Craig Arnold : Yes. So to your point, first of all, our relationship with hyperscalers, we have a very strong relationship with all of the hyperscale data center customers and it's -- and as we talked about before, clearly, one of our fastest-growing markets and even within the data center market, we're growing faster with hyperscalers in general more so than -- but growing with colo as well. We're growing in on-prem, but we're growing most quickly with the hyperscalers. And to the point around commercial agreements, everybody is challenged right now around capacity. And as a result of that, the nature of the discussions, the visibility around projects, the forward commitments have changed as the hyperscalers and others are working to ensure that they have capacity in place to deal with their outlook and their growth. I mean, today, there is a little bit of a competing for capacity dynamic that's taking place in the marketplace, which has obviously led to better and more transparent, more committed commercial agreements with our customers. Operator : Thank you. One moment, for our next question. We'll now take a call from Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. Steve Tusa : Hi, good morning. How are you? Craig Arnold : Hey, Steve. Steve Tusa : So just on the utility side, I mean, a lot going on there with all these customers raising budgets. But Hubbell's results were a little bit weak. You guys actually are guiding just below double-digit next year. I think in this initial market outlook, maybe you could just talk about what you're seeing in utility and what the slowing is there? And then, lastly, how you kind of participate, just remind us how you participate in generation applications? Craig Arnold : Yes. The first thing I'd say is that in Q3, I mean our utility business continued to perform well. Our utilities revenues increased mid-teens in Electrical Americas and low-teens in Electrical Global. So I mean, obviously, when you think about different companies, they have different product portfolios, you have different customers, you have different mix. But our business is actually continuing to perform quite well, and we remain confident. We talked about our expectation that the utility market would grow at a growth rate of around 11% a year. Our customers continue to invest in CapEx to support this growth. And so from where we sit, while there's always going to be temporary hiccups in periods of expansion and pause as they digest capacity. There's nothing that we've seen that would suggest that the utility market, at least where we play, won't continue to be a very strong market for years to come. If you think about the unfortunate ramifications of these storms that we're seeing around the world, certainly two big ones in the U.S. So they continue to spend money on resiliency to do grid hardening as the consumption and the demand for power continues to go up. Obviously, that's backing up into utilities having to increase capacity. And by the way, data centers are a really big important market for utility customers. And then you have things like undergrounding that takes place -- that's taking place in places like the West Coast, where a lot of the utility infrastructure is being put underground, which is also creating growth opportunities for us. And so while once again, I know it's sometimes difficult to get a an exact read on these markets based upon perhaps what peers are doing, but our utility business is strong and going well. Steve Tusa : Okay. And then just lastly on the backlog and order side. These orders are becoming obviously a bit more lumpy, like you had a huge first quarter, nice bounce back here from my math. In the third quarter, your backlog went up really nicely. It's up 25% year-over-year. Is this kind of a sequentially like a stable level of orders? Do you see them continue to pick up a bit sequentially from here? And then why would the backlog where it is today, up 25% year-over-year, and you're bringing on capacity? So you should be able to release much more of that backlog next year. Why wouldn't things actually accelerate on a revenue basis, at least volume-wise next year for the Electrical business? Craig Arnold : I'd say that, first of all, to your question around orders in general. And as we tried to characterize for the investors that we are living in a period of time now where orders have become a lot more lumpy than they've been historically. And a lot of that is tied to mega projects. And it's one of the reasons why we started to talk about mega projects on these calls to give the investors transparency in terms of what has been a fundamental shift in the size of a lot of the projects that we're seeing in our Electrical business. And with these big projects, with these mega projects, that just creates lumpiness in orders, and that's one of the reasons why we went to a rolling 12 months to try to smooth out these patterns. And then once again, you try to dissect it anyway into a quarter, but we haven't exactly been successful in the smoothing. But the message is that -- I mean these orders will continue to be lumpy. As long as we're living in the world of these big mega projects, these orders will continue to be lumpy. And the other thing I'd say what we try to do is that, so we try to give you multiple views, right? It's not just orders. We try to say, hey, let me tell you about the front end of mega projects. Let me tell you about what's going on with our negotiations. We give you, obviously, revenue and we give you orders. And so that we try to give you a composite view of all the things that we look at that underlie the confidence in our view on what the world is going to look like going forward. Now, the question around should growth accelerate from this point forward. I'd say, on the volume side, as long as the capacity comes in line, yes, it's very possible that we could see volume acceleration. Now, I would caveat that by saying that we've had a lot of price in the business historically over the last couple of years. And as we've even transitioned this year, the relative contributions from volume versus price have changed quite significantly with most of the volume now, most of the growth now coming from volume. And so you're not going to have the same price tailwind that you've had in growth as we look forward. Operator : Thank you. One moment, for our next question. We'll now take a call from Julian Mitchell at Barclays. Jack Pilleteri : Hi, good morning. This is Jack Pilleteri on for Julian Mitchell. How much is the capacity constrained at present, how are lead times trending in main product categories like switchgear, UPS, what is the pace in which more capacity can come on stream? Craig Arnold : Jack, you broke up the last part of which you said, I didn't quite hear. It broke up, but in terms of -- Jack Pilleteri : [Indiscernible] sorry, go ahead. Craig Arnold : Your phone, we're having trouble with the connection, but let me -- I'll deal with the first part and then maybe we can -- you can come back to the second part of your question around how and where are we capacity constrained. We talk about this $1.5 billion of incremental investment that we're making in capacity. A lot of that -- most of that is going into our electrical business to deal with those specific areas and markets where we are capacity constrained, be it in data center markets and things like transformers or electrical switchgear that really cuts across many of the different end markets that we serve. I talked about in some of my outbound commentary, the investments we've made in some of the circuit breakers as well as in things like Bussmann fuses. And so where we've had -- where we have capacity constraints, so we look forward and we see the potential for capacity strength, we are proactively making those investments and trying to get out in front of it. Having said that, lead times today are still not where we'd like them to be ideally. Largely a function of the fact that our businesses continue to be stronger than what we forecasted. No question even coming into this year, if you take a look at the revenue growth in our Electrical Americas business versus our original guide. I mean those numbers are up quite significantly, both in revenue, orders, negotiations really across the Board. And so I would just tell you that we are today working as closely with customers as we ever had to make sure that we are getting out in front of the capacity requirements needed, so that we don't end up being a bottleneck and a constraint for the industry. So second half of your question, maybe that addressed it or not. Jack Pilleteri : Yes, that addressed it. Thank you. And on the 2025 outlook, how are you thinking about Electrical Americas versus Global next year, there's a 1,000 basis point growth gap guided in 2024. Is it a very wide gap again next year that's dialed in? Craig Arnold : Yes, I'd say it's too early for us to provide specific guidance on our various segments for 2025. But having said that, if you think about kind of these big mega trends that we've been talking to you about over the last couple of years, the Americas business has had a disproportionate benefit, a disproportionate number of them. If you think about what's going on in data centers today, there's data center growth taking place everywhere, but 70% of these data center projects are basically coming in the U.S. We talk about reindustrialization and the amount of money that's being put into increasing the U.S. manufacturing capacity, a lot of that is being disproportionately benefiting the U.S. And so to the extent that these mega trends continue to be what they are, you'll probably continue to see a disproportionate growth coming from the Americas business. Having said that, a lot of what we do in Europe today tends to be more of the short cycle, and we are, in fact, seeing a bottoming in those markets. But a long way of saying, we're still working through the details and we'll give you a lot more color when it comes to early next year. Operator : Thank you. One moment, for our next question. We'll now take a call from Scott Davis at Melius Research. Scott Davis : Craig, you threw out a number earlier about a 40% win rate. And I just wanted to get a sense of context. It seems like given the capacity constraints that where you guys want to win, I would imagine you generally have pretty high odds of winning. And so does the 40% kind of reflect -- first of all, is there any historical context, is that higher? Is that normal? Is it -- but any color around that? Am I reading it right that there's just some projects maybe that are just less profitable, and so you're going to be less aggressive bidding on them. And so it's -- that number can be -- it's hard for us to know whether that's a good number or a bad number, but perhaps the behind the scenes is that number is a little bit better than historical? Craig Arnold : Yes. I appreciate the question, Scott. And I would tell you today, the instructions that we've given to our team is we want to win every order. We don't want to see ground on any order or in any segment of the business. But to your specific question around the win rate, yes, the 40% win rate would be higher than our underlying market share in Electrical Americas. And so I think you can read that to be that we're winning at a higher rate than we have historically. And that's certainly a good thing and bodes well for the future. And then you say, why? I mean, largely, I would tell you it's because the bigger the project, the more complex the project, the more likely it is that we're going to win and that our solutions are going to be chosen over other alternatives. And so -- and that's just been historically true for the business that the more mission-critical, the more complex the project, the -- it increases the rate of our winning. But if you think about the win rate across various segments, and we talk about this 40% of the context of mega projects these mega projects are broad. They are across almost every one of our verticals with the exception, let's say, of residential. And I would say there -- I quite frankly not looked at the data, but my guess is that our win rate is not terribly different across the various segments of the market. Scott Davis : Okay. That's helpful. And then I know there's been a lot of questions about capacity adds. But can you just give us a little bit of a sense of the breakdown of new rooftops versus kind of adding lines that kind of thing. So just a sense of what that capacity looks like in footprint? Craig Arnold : Yes. And I would tell you -- I can always say it's really -- it's a combination of both. And in many cases, it is, in fact, expanding in the context of an existing footprint where we have space available on some land where we can build out our capacity. In some cases, it's adding lines to facilities. And in some cases, it is brand-new Greenfield facilities. And so I can only tell you that it's a mixture of all three of those and very much consistent with where we see our requirements and where we have particular limitations. And so I'm not sure if I'm addressing your specific question, but I can just tell you that it really does cut through all three of those areas. Operator : Thank you. One moment, for our next question. We'll now take a call from Joe Ritchie at Goldman Sachs. Joe Ritchie : So rather than like try to get you to say that you're going to do double-digit portfolio growth next year, even though that's what it seems like the framework is pointing to. I'm just curious, Craig, from a pricing standpoint, I know you said that's moderated. Would you still expect to get pricing across the portfolio in 2025? Craig Arnold : Yes. The short answer, Joe, is yes. I mean, and if you think about our industry historically, our industry historically has gotten price, and I would say that we're probably back in a more historical pattern of getting price each year, but not during this period of time when we came -- if you go back to what happened over the last few years, you had the COVID-driven supply chain disruptions that drove a period of extraordinary inflation. And so we had to get out in front of that and recover inflation, then you had the scarcity issue. And so as those issues continue to be in the rearview mirror, we're going to go back to more of a normal level of price realization for the business. But absolutely, we will still get price into 2025. And by the way, price is embedded in those market numbers. We gave you the market assumptions for what we think the market is going to do in 2025, and we do incorporate price in that number as well. Joe Ritchie : Okay. Got it. That's helpful. And then I'm just trying to understand the linkage between the project negotiation pipeline being up 60%. And then, your comments around 2025 starts expecting to hit a new high. As you kind of think about the pipeline, does that include some of the projects that haven't even started? Or is that just -- or are we talking about kind of like additives that the starts will be higher next year? And what you're bidding on today is already what's kind of broken ground? Craig Arnold : I'd say that quite -- it's tough to really answer that question because these projects vary dramatically in terms of the type of projects that they are and the time between an announcement of start and the completion. And what we said in prior calls is that from a completion standpoint, these projects are three to five years out. And so what -- certainly, announcements become starts at some point, and it does vary widely depending upon the project itself. But I think the simple answer is, yes, a lot of these announcements today that are embedded in our numbers will, in fact, become starts in 2025. And in fact, I mean, if we take a look at it over a longer period of time, let's say, 2023 to 2027, the last data point we had, we were forecasting starts to be up some 23% over a period of beginning in 2023 going to 2027. We've not updated that number. But clearly, we're seeing an increase in construction starts, which is what you would naturally expect given the size of these announced projects. Operator : Thank you. One moment, for our next question. We'll now take a call from Tim Thein at Raymond James. Tim Thein : Great. Thank you. In the interest of time, maybe I'll switch two together, Craig, maybe one on just on aerospace, maybe kind of talk through what -- whether it's orders or actual sales trends just kind of as you navigate the strike impact to the extent that, that continues the implications in terms of the mix for you between more on the commercial side between OEM and aftermarket. And then just, I guess, Part B is just on the electrical side, as you talk about this project pipeline and the growth you're seeing there, some of the big sectors that you've highlighted, like obviously, data centers, but in power and industrial also being pretty fairly equipment intensive. So just how you think about that traditional rule of thumb in terms of kind of the electrical content per project? And if you're seeing any changes in that just given the complexion of the pipeline. Thank you. Craig Arnold : Yes, the first, maybe to the aerospace question specifically and specifically as it relates to the strike impact. At this point, what we have -- we made some assumptions naturally around what we think is going to happen during the course of Q4. And that's why I mentioned in the commentary, we don't know when these strikes are going to be resolved. We're hopeful that it happens sooner rather than later, but we don't know. And so that's why we said, we've made an assumption that's baked into our Q4 outlook. If we're right, it's fine. If we're wrong, it could have a slightly bigger impact on our revenue outlook. But not going to have an impact on our earnings. We'll deliver the earnings under either circumstances, but do feel like the industry will resolve these strikes at probably at some point over the course of Q4, but who knows at this junction. In terms of the mix, you're right. I mean at some point, I mean it has a positive impact on mix to the extent that the fleet of new aircraft are not being built and are having to run the existing fleet harder. That doesn't happen right away. There tends to be a lag effect of that. But ultimately speaking, as long as consumers continue to get on planes and fly and they are, it means the fleet is operating. And in these older aircraft, we'll need additional service, additional aftermarket components. And as you know, aftermarket is very favorable for Eaton and for other companies as well. And so we'll just have to wait and see how that plays out, certainly disappointing that we needed to reduce our numbers to account for it. But once again, firmly believe that it's simply timing that these aircraft will be built. These aircraft are needed, and it just pushes some of the demand into 2025 and beyond based upon the current issues that are taking place in the industry. To your question on projects and the project pipeline in Electrical, if I get the gist of your question there, yes, it does matter a lot, the kind of project. And we talk about the electrical intensity of a project. And the electrical intensity of certain types of projects is very different, I mean if you take data centers, for example, when we take a look at the non-res construction market, data center, for example, accounts for about 2% of non-res construction market, only 2%. Yet, it's in the range of, let's call it, 15% to 20% of our electrical business. And that gives you a sense for the electrical intensity of certain kinds of projects versus others. And so for us, the good news is that if you think about the kinds of projects that are being built today, if you think about on the one extreme you have a commercial office where the electrical intensity is quite low. Data center is on the other extreme, whether the electrical intensity is very high, utilities growing nicely where the electrical intensity is very high. So the type of project matters greatly. And where we sit today and our outlook those -- that mix will continue to be favorable for our company. Operator : Thank you. One moment, for our next question. We will now take a call from Nicole DeBlase at Deutsche Bank. Nicole DeBlase : Yes, thanks, guys. Good morning, and actually, good afternoon now. Thanks for fitting me in. Craig Arnold : Sure. Nicole DeBlase : I guess, I'll just ask one in the interest of time. Could you talk a little bit about what you're seeing, Craig, in China? We've heard a few companies kind of say the things got a bit worse there this quarter. And then I guess, you kind of mentioned hope that short cycle in Europe could be bottoming. So if you can maybe expand on are you seeing any evidence of recovery there today? Craig Arnold : Yes. Appreciate the question, Nicole. First, on China. Our China business has performed very well. I mean, if we look at our China business specifically in Q3, we actually saw very good growth. I think our growth in China was close to double-digits in Q3. And our outlook even going forward is for pretty robust growth in our China business. I do think that, that's mostly a function of things that we have done specifically in the context of our business. And as you know, we had a number of joint ventures that we signed in China that gave us just a lot of additional capability and capacity and our team in China, we think one of the best in the industry just winning. So our China business is doing well, and our outlook for our China business continues to be strong. To your -- to the point around Europe specifically, and that's where, to your point, we are more exposed to short cycle, which means residential MOEM as is Europe in general. And we do think we bottomed out, and we would think that as we look forward, those markets continue to grow from this point, and that's kind of embedded as well in our own outlook for Q4. We think that as interest rates perhaps start to moderate a bit that helps the resi market that helps some of the industrial markets as well. But I'd say, we can call today on the short-cycle stuff, it feels like we bumped along the bottom throughout the summer months, and we started to see a little bit of lift off in at least some of the markets, distributed IT, for example, in Q3 and the outlook for MOEM and residential is more positive as we look forward. Operator : Thank you. One moment, for our next question. We'll now take a call from Andy Kaplowitz at Citi. Andy Kaplowitz : Craig, can you give more color into Eaton's ability to offset ongoing vehicles market-related weakness. If you look in your vehicles, margin trajectory, obviously, that 19.4% and declining growth was impressive. Is that a reflection of strong positioning in the market given favorable price versus cost? And how long could that last if the vehicles end market stays weak? Craig Arnold : I appreciate the question. We have worked hard in our vehicle business to, first of all, run our business better and drive better operational execution in our business. And as you know, we went through a period of time in our own vehicle business through supply chain disruptions and some other operational challenges inside of the business where we weren't executing as well as we know we can. And our team has just done a great job of essentially improving the way we run our factories and our facilities and sorting out inefficiencies in the plant. We've also been very active in that business on really managing the portfolio. One of the things we've talked to the investors about is that we expect every one of our businesses to be a portfolio manager. Every business has a head. Every business has a tail. Every business has a piece of it where you'd say, we don't have competitive advantage here. We don't make great margins. It's not a growth piece of the business, and we got to have a plan to address and fix it. And so we have been very active in managing the portfolio in terms of the things that we control in our vehicle business as well. And so the margins that we posted this quarter, I think a reflection of the fact that our team is executing extremely well, and we would expect them to continue to execute well as we move forward. Andy Kaplowitz : And just a quick follow-up to that. In relation to your restructuring efforts, I think you gave us $75 million for 2025. I would assume a sizable amount of that is in Electrical Global, and that is going to start to help you close the gap with Electrical Americas? Or how should we think about that? Craig Arnold : Yes, I mean, without a doubt, I mean, if you think about where we're restructuring, it's generally going to be in those businesses where the margins are not at the level that we have in the rest of the company and certainly Global is a piece of that formula as well. But the big challenge more than that, and we'll do the restructuring, the big thing in Europe is markets. I mean markets, as you've seen from not just Eaton, but from most of our peers and other companies in the region is that Europe today is just not getting the growth that we're seeing in the U.S. and in other regions of the world, in China. So I think more than anything, we need a return to growth in Europe. Our incremental margins are quite high, on the back of a little bit of growth. And so that, for us, is the thing that we're focused on most is that we have to grow our business in Europe, and that's going to ultimately close the gap with some of the margins that we see in the Americas business. Operator : Thank you. One moment, for our next question. We'll now take a call from Joseph O'Dea at Wells Fargo. Joseph O'Dea: Hi, thanks. I'll keep it to one. Craig, I just want a little bit more color on the timing of all the capacity investments coming online. I'm sure it's staggered. But by the middle of next year, do you expect to have most of that online? And the reason for the question is when we look at the electrical backlog moving up again sequentially at $11.8 billion, trying to think through the degree to which Eaton is, in some instances, the bottleneck. How quickly you can work that down with some pretty significant capacity additions coming online, even to the degree that can Americas grow faster next year as that capacity comes online? Craig Arnold : Yes. I think to answer the second part of your question, we're absolutely counting on that capacity addition coming in next year to help our volume growth and most of the capacity will really come in over the next, let's say, two to three years. Some of it's coming in now as we talked about in some of my commentary. But maybe just to address maybe the broader question around the backlog. Backlog is actually a good thing. Past-due backlog is a bad thing. And I would tell you that our past-due backlog has come down. So we're doing a better job today of ensuring that we're delivering against our customers' expectation. But we have growing backlog largely because our markets are growing, and we're getting much better visibility into our customers' requirements. And in many cases, we're getting longer lead time visibility on orders. And so I would say, in general, I would not think about a growing backlog as a problem in us being a bottleneck for the industry. A past-due backlog would suggest we are a bottleneck for the industry. But I would tell you today that our lead times, in general, are very competitive with most of our peers. Operator : Thank you. One moment, for our next question. We'll now take our last question from Brett Linzey at Mizuho. Brett Linzey : Hi, good afternoon. Thanks. I appreciate the thoughts on 2025. I just wanted to follow-up on the incremental margins. So the 30% to 35% on organic, should we think of this as the base level and then the restructuring savings would be on top of that? Or are there some offsets on some of this OpEx investment ramp relative to the restructuring savings? Just want to square those pieces. Thanks. Craig Arnold : Yes. No, we've given you a range of 30% to 35%, but you should really think about that as an all-in incremental and that not putting the restructuring on top of that. What we've said historically, we said you ought to be thinking about 30% incrementals. And so we've tried to account for restructuring benefits in the different mid-point of where we think the incrementals are going to be. But I'd say that you have a couple of forces obviously working for you and against you in terms of as we come through this ramp. On the one hand, obviously, we're getting volume leverage, and that's very helpful. But on the other hand, we're also starting up new factories and there's always inefficiencies with factory start-ups. We're adding commercial resources to deal with the volume ramps that we're working through right now. So I'd say, on balance, the -- take the mid-point or so of that 30% to 35% range that's better than what we've used for planning purposes for most of our plans. It's certainly below what we delivered this year, for sure. And this year, I would just point out that there was a lot of price in what we delivered in the form of incrementals this year as well as we didn't have the same level of start-ups and ramp-ups in both our factory and commercial activities. Yan Jin : Hey, thanks, guys. I think I really appreciate everybody's questions. As always, the IR team is available to have any follow-up questions, as you have. Enjoy the rest of your day.

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Yan Jin, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Yan Jin : Hi. Good morning. Thank you all for joining us for Eaton's fourth quarter 2024 earnings call. With me today are Craig Arnold, our Chairman and CEO; Paulo Ruiz, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Olivier Leonetti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our agenda today includes the opening remarks by Craig, then he will turn it over to Olivier, who will highlight the company's performance in the fourth quarter. We will then turn it over to Paulo, who will provide the guidance for Q1 and the full year 2025. As we have done on our past calls, we will take questions at the end of our closed commentary. The press release and the presentation we'll go through today have been posted on our website. This presentation, including the adjusted earnings per share, adjusted free cash flow and other non-GAAP measures. They are reconciled in the appendix. A webcast of this call is accessible on our website and will be available for replay. I would like to remind you that our commentary today will include the statements related to the expected future results of the company and are therefore forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our forecasted projection due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and the presentation. With that, I'll turn it over to, Craig. Craig Arnold : Okay. Thanks, Yan. And we're pleased to close out the year with another, strong quarterly results. I'm especially proud of how our team executed in the quarter. As you know, we have to overcome the impact of the strikes in the Aerospace industry and the lingering impact of the hurricane, which impacted our Electrical Americas business. For the quarter, we generated a Q4 record for adjusted EPS of $2.83, up 11% from prior year. We also delivered record segment margins of 24.7%, up 190 basis points than last year and above the high-end of our guidance. And we continue to see strong market activity. On a rolling 12-month basis, Electrical orders were up 12%, led by Electrical Americas with orders up 16%, and orders were up 10% in Aerospace. This led to another quarter of growing and record backlogs with once again outstanding results in Electrical Americas, up 29% and in Aerospace, up 16% with book-to-bill ratios above one in both businesses. As you can see from the chart, we're set for another strong year in 2025. Paulo will walk you through our guidance, but we do expect another year of healthy end markets, strong organic growth, margin expansion, improving free cash flow and double-digit increases in adjusted EPS. Turning to Page 4, we're once again providing an overview of megatrends and how they're driving growth in our end-markets. You're very familiar with this chart by now, but we did want to provide an overview of how these markets performed in 2024 versus our expectations. This is especially relevant in the context of our outlook for 2025, that Paulo will provide later today and at our investor meeting in March. In Electrical, our end markets performed better than expectations due to strength in data centers and in the Americas market. Strong growth in these two areas more than offset some unplanned weakness in residential and OEM markets. In Aerospace, markets grew nicely and in line with plan, and this was despite the Boeing strike. And our vehicle market was a bit of a mixed bag with better-than-planned performance in commercial vehicles, offsetting weakness in the light vehicle market, which includes eMobility. Overall, we continue to see megatrends noted here as important drivers of secular growth in our markets and why you should expect Eaton to post attractive growth for years to come. And this secular growth is perhaps most evidenced by the megatrend chart that you see on Slide 5 in the presentation. As a reminder, mega project is a project with an announced value of $1 billion or more, and our reference point begins in January of 2021. As you know, we've reported this data for a few quarters now, and our conclusion hasn't changed. Each quarter, we're seeing an increasing number of projects, higher dollar values and a growing backlog. Q4 was another record with 65 projects announced at a value of more than $150 billion. Through Q4, we're now at 569 projects with a cumulative value of $1.7 trillion, and the backlog now stands at $1.9 trillion, up 33% from last year. Through Q4, approximately 15% of these projects have started, and we expect a record number of starts in 2025. Many of you have asked the question about cancellation rates, which we continue to monitor as well. To date, cancellations have actually been modest, around 11% and well below historical levels. A couple of pieces of Eaton-specific data. For projects that have started, we've won over $1.8 billion orders with a win rate of almost 40%, and we're in active negotiations on another $3.1 billion of Electrical content. So as you can see from the math, most of these projects haven't reached a negotiation stage, and we expect our orders to continue to grow. Given the heightened discussions on data centers this week, I wanted to take a moment to highlight our data center business and why we have so much confidence in our outlook for continued growth. The information on Slide 6 summarizes our sales, negotiations, orders and backlog for our data center business. It includes hyperscale, colos, on-prem data centers and the major categories of cloud, training and inference. And cloud is still, by a wide margin, the largest category. As you can see from the data, the rate of growth is continuing to accelerate with negotiations and orders well ahead of sales. I'll not read each of the numbers as they speak for themselves, but we'll ask that you note a few points. Our backlog is rapidly increasing, up 50% over prior year, which was up 70% over 2022. And as you've all seen, customers continue to increase their forecast for capital investments. Hyperscale customers alone expect to spend almost $300 billion in CapEx in 2025, up 30% from 2024. And perhaps the most notable number on page is the reference to the seven years. At 2024 build rates, it would take seven years to consume the current backlog. And the data center construction build rate doubled between 2023 and 2024. So any notion that this market will slow down is simply not consistent with any of the data that we're seeing. The industry will no doubt continue to see innovation and technology developments that reduce costs. And if judged by history, this will be good for the industry and an accelerator of growth. For 2025 and for years to come, we expect data centers to be our strongest market and stand by our previous forecast, which assumed strong double-digit growth. Now, I'll turn it over to Olivier to take us through the financial results for the quarter. Olivier Leonetti : Thanks, Craig. I will start by providing a summary of our Q4 results, which again includes many new records. We posted fourth quarter record sales of $6.2 billion, up 6% organically or 5%, including 1 point of FX headwind. Hurricane Helene and labor strikes in the Aerospace industry negatively impacted Q4 sales by approximately $80 million or 130 basis points. Operating profit grew 13%, and segment margin expanded 190 basis points to an all-time record 24.7%. Adjusted EPS of $2.83 increased by 11% over the prior year. This is a Q4 quarterly record and near the high-end of our guidance range. This performance resulted in an all-time record cash flow performance, including operating cash flow of $1.6 billion, up 23% on a year-over-year basis and free cash flow of $1.3 billion, up 27% versus prior year. I will now review the segment's quarterly results followed by a recap of the year. On Slide 8, we detail our Americas results. The business continues to execute very well and delivered another record quarter. We set new records for operating profit and margins and posted a Q4 quarterly record sales. Organic sales growth of 9% was driven primarily by strength in data center, along with solid growth in commercial and institutional markets. Without the impacts of the hurricane disruptions to the business, organic growth would have been in the double-digits. Operating margin of 31.6% was up 310 basis points versus prior year, benefiting from higher sales. On a rolling 12-month basis, orders remain at a high level of 16%, demonstrating continued tailwinds from the various megatrends. We had particular strength in the data center market, where activity remains very robust. For example, Dodge data shows U.S. announced data center project starts are up 99% in 2024 and 173% year-over-year in Q4. U.S. data center construction backlog is now estimated to extend out about seven years based on 2024 build rates. Electrical Americas backlog increased 29% year-over-year with a book-to-bill ratio of 1.2 on a rolling 12-month basis. These results closed out a record year for the business, which posted full year revenue of $11.4 billion, organic growth of 13% and margin of 30.2%, up 370 basis points over prior year. With the tailwinds from secular trends, incremental capacity coming online, strong execution and robust backlog, Electrical Americas remains well-positioned as we enter 2025. The next chart summarizes the results of our Electrical Global segment. Total revenue growth of 4% included organic growth of 5.5% and FX tailwind of 1.5%. We had strength in data center and utility markets. Regionally, we saw continued strength in APAC with double-digit organic growth and high single-digit organic growth in EMEA. Operating margin of 17.7% was down 110 basis points versus prior year primarily driven by mix. Orders were up 4% on a rolling 12-month basis. Similar to sales growth, the strength was driven by the data center and utility markets. Backlog increased 16% over prior year and book-to-bill continues to remain strong. Q4 was 1.1 on a rolling 12-month basis. For the full year, Electrical Global posted 4% organic growth with 18.4 margins. Before moving to our industrial businesses, I'd like to briefly recap the combined Electrical segments. For Q4, we posted organic growth of 8% and segment margin of 26.7%, which was up 170 basis points over prior year. For the full year, we posted organic growth of 10% and segment margins of 26%, up 220 basis points over 2023. On a rolling 12-month basis, orders were up 12%, and our book-to-bill ratio for our Electrical sector remains very strong at 1.1. We remain confident in our positioning for continued growth with strong margins in our overall Electrical business. Page 10 highlights our Aerospace segment. We posted all-time record sales and Q4 record operating profit. Organic and total growth was 9% for the quarter driven with growth in all end markets with - commercial aftermarket. Without the impacts of the Aerospace industry strikes, organic growth will have been in the double-digits. Operating margin was strong at 22.9%, up 50 basis points year-over-year, mostly from higher sales. On a rolling 12-month basis, orders increased 10% up from 6% in the prior quarter with particular strength in military OEM, commercial OEM and commercial aftermarket. Year-over-year backlog increased 16% and was up 2% sequentially. On a rolling 12-month basis, our book-to-bill for our Aerospace segment remains strong at 1.1. On the full year basis, Aerospace posted 10% organic growth with 23% margins. Moving on to our Vehicle segment on Page 11, in the quarter, total revenue was down 10%, including a 7% organic decline primarily driven by weaknesses in the North America, EMEA and APAC light vehicle markets and three points of unfavorable effects. Despite the top line weaknesses, the team executed well from a margin perspective. Operating margin came in at 18.8%, 90 basis points over prior year from improved operating efficiencies. On a full year basis, Vehicle recorded organic revenue down 5% with 18% margins. On Page 12, we show results of our eMobility business. Total revenue was down 11%, including a 10% organic decline, primarily driven by our customers' program launch and production ramp-up delays and 1% unfavorable FX. Operating profit was $3 million, resulting in operating margin of 1.8% for the quarter. On a full year basis, eMobility posted 4% organic growth with negative 1% margin. Moving to Page 13, we show our Electrical and Aerospace backlog updated through Q4. Backlog continues to be very strong with Electrical at $11.8 billion and Aerospace, at $3.7 billion for a total backlog of $15.5 billion. Versus prior year, our backlogs have grown by 27% in Electrical and 16% in Aerospace. They are also increasing sequentially. As noted earlier, book-to-bill ratios for Electrical and Aerospace are 1.1 and 1.1, respectively. The continued growth in our backlog underscores our high-level of confidence in future demand. In addition to our strong backlog growth in 2024, the next page shows the continued strength in our negotiations pipeline supports, our expectation for strong markets and structurally higher organic growth rates. In Electrical Americas, the pipeline has increased nearly four times, since 2019. In fact, the pipeline grew 40% year-over-year, showing acceleration versus our multiyear CAGR of 29%. The year-over-year increase was largely driven by data center, commercial and institutional and utility end markets. Within the commercial institutional end market, growth was driven by education, government and transportation. This is even stronger than the 13% organic growth in our Electrical Americas business, which suggests continued strength going forward. Now I will pass it over to Craig to summarize our 2024 performance. Craig Arnold : Thanks, Olivier. On Page 15, we summarize our 2024 financial results compared to our original guidance. You may recall that our practice is to set stretch goals for our businesses that are above our external guidance. If we execute well and markets perform as expected, it should put us in a position to exceed our guidance. This occurred again in 2024. Throughout the year, we demonstrated the ability to exceed our commitments and raise guidance on all key metrics. We delivered 8% organic growth, an 18% increase in increase in adjusted EPS, all-time record margins of 24% and a 23% free cash flow, all above our initial guidance. Of particular note, segment margins were up 140 basis points versus the original guidance midpoint and 200 basis points from prior year. And adjusted EPS of $10.80 was 6% above the $10.15 midpoint of our original guide. And as you know, every business deals with a number of market uncertainties, and life has a way of delivering unexpected surprises. So we run the company the way that allows us to absorb these unknown headwinds and still deliver our commitments and hopefully more. So with a brief summary of 2024 on Page 16, and I'd say that we're once again proud of our team's execution in the year. We delivered another record year of financial results while reinvesting in the business like never before. But while we're proud of our progress, we're not satisfied because we can do so much better. We're in the right markets, and the identified megatrends are creating some of the biggest opportunities that we'll see in our lifetime. The growth opportunities are everywhere. Our negotiations pipeline, record orders and strong backlogs are evidence of our ability to convert on the opportunities. And we now have the capacity in place or coming soon to support even faster growth. We have Eaton Business System, we call it EBS, that keeps everyone focused on getting better, running better functions, better factories and better businesses. It's how we improve our efficiency and expand margins. So now is our time, and I couldn't be more pleased with the team leading the next stage of Eaton's transformation. And on that note, I'll pass it over to Paulo, who will walk us through our key assumptions and financial guidance for the year. Paulo Ruiz : Thanks, Craig. Shifting our attention to 2025 on Page 17. We provide our view on end market growth expectations for the next year. As you can see, we continue to anticipate attractive growth markets in nearly all of end markets. We're expecting double-digit growth in data center and distributed IT, commercial aerospace and electrical vehicles. For data centers, we remain constructive in our future outlook, given the strength and breadth of our secular trends. We continue to see strong demand in data center market with the adoption of cloud computing and acceleration of AI technologies, including inference and training. So as more AI technology emerge, acceleration in AI usage could drive higher consumption of our AI hardware, including our electrical equipment. We also expect solid growth in utility and modest growth across many of our other end markets. So we anticipate weaknesses in commercial vehicle and resi markets. But the change in resi outlook from last quarter is offset with strength in other end markets. And we do not see a change in our overall market growth between 6% and 8%. Overall, 2025 should be another year of significant growth with more than 85% of our end markets seeing growth. Our growth outlook is supported also by a strong order book, a strong record backlog and favorable secular trends. So we remain well positioned to deliver differentiated growth in 2025. Now moving to Page 18, we summarize our 2025 revenue and margin guidance. Organic growth for 2025 is expected to be between 7% and 9% with particular strength in Electrical Americas at 11.5% at the midpoint. And I'll also add that healthy end markets combined once again with our large backlog continue to provide premium visibility to support our 2025 outlook. For segment margins, our guidance range is, between 24.4% and 24.8%, is an improvement of 60 basis points at midpoint from our 2024 all-time record margins of 24%. Now on the next page, we have the balance of our guidance for 2025 and Q1. So for 2025, our EPS is expected to be between $11.80 and $12.20, a $12 at the midpoint and up 11% from 2024. And our free cash flow, our guidance is between $3.7 billion to $4.1 billion, up 11% at the midpoint. We also expect to repurchase between $2 billion and $2.4 billion of our shares outstanding. And given our strong cash position at the end of the year and our strong cash generation this year, we will leave plenty of room for strategic M&A. We have also provided guidance on this page for Q1, as you can see. Turning to Slide 20. We wanted to take a minute to highlight our upcoming Annual Investor Conference on March 11, 2025. We'll be back in New York City, and we'll stream the presentation live on eaton.com. Along with myself, you will also have presentations from other senior leaders that are shown here on this page. So we are really excited to talk about the future of the company, including outlining our 2030 targets. With that, I'll hand it back to Yan and the operator for Q&A. Yan Jin : Thanks, Paulo. For the Q&A today, please limit your opportunity to one question and a follow-up. Thanks in advance for your cooperation. With that, I will turn it over to the operator to give you guys the instruction. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Chris Snyder with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed. Chris Snyder : Thank you. Maybe starting off with one for Olivier. So the guide calls for, I guess, at the midpoint, about 6.5% organic in Q1 and then 8.5% the rest of the year. Can you talk about the drivers of that pickup in growth? And then what should we expect for the cadence of adjusted EPS throughout the remainder of 2025? Thank you. Olivier Leonetti : Thank you for your question. Let me cover first the EPS guidance through the year, and Paulo and I will tag team on the revenue section. If you look at the EPS, we are planning today to have the first half to directionally represent 48% of the full EPS guide for the year and the second half as a result, 52%. If you look at the recent past, we used to have a mix between first half and second half of 46% and 54%. So we're well balanced first half, second half. I wanted also to talk about the Q1 EPS guide. Again, similarly to the first half, second half, the Q1 sequential decline is actually better than what we have experienced in our recent past. Usually, you saw a decline sequentially Q1 over Q4 of about 10%, 11%. This guide implied a decline of 4%. The decline is always expected because of merit increases. And also, we are very bullish about our business, and we invest in demand generation and manufacturing. So that explains also the Q1 sequential decline on EPS. And maybe in revenue, Paulo? Paulo Ruiz : Yes, just to add - thanks for the question, Chris. So to think about the revenue split for modeling purposes, I think it's fair to assume the first half being at 7 and the second half at 9. And I can give you more color on the segments. Electrical Americas will accelerate a bit in the second half because of the extra additional capacity we are adding. I want to say that we track those projects one by one. So far, so good. They are coming as we planned. So that's the Electrical Americas, the biggest segment. We also see that in the second half, most probably the Electrical Global business will pick up again with some recovery in the European markets. Aerospace is flattish over the year, well distributed. And then the Vehicle markets would tend to be higher in the second half, given the very easy comps of the end of the year. So that's the way to think about it. Chris Snyder : Appreciate that. Really, really helpful. And then if I could follow up with one, maybe for Craig. Really appreciate all the updates on demand outlook. Certainly, a lot of good trends out there. But I wanted to ask about the about the supply side. We've heard a lot the product availability in the industry being incredibly tight last few years now, I guess, switch gears, obviously, a lot of transformers. Are these lead times starting to come down? And when you look at the industry-wide capacity adds, do you think that's enough to meet demand? Or do you think that this industry could still be short product beyond just the near-term? Thank you. Craig Arnold : Yes. Appreciate the question. It's actually a question that we've not gotten in a while. And quite frankly, it's not been a conversation that we've had internally in a while, and that's a good thing. I mean we - coming out of the COVID kind of period when supply chains just got massively disrupted, we were spending weekly calls and daily calls with our suppliers on dealing with supply constraints. And so I'd say for the most part, we're back to where we were pre-COVID when you think about our internal supply chains. And a lot of those constraints have been, for the most part, resolved. We've gotten out in front of it. We have Eaton have as we put in lots new capacity in place as well as our suppliers. And so I think from that piece of it, I think we have fairly good visibility and transparency in terms of the outlook for these markets, and our suppliers have responded. Now, as we think about our longer-term or midterm outlook, we're certainly constraining our view of the world largely, because we do think the labor continues to be somewhat constrained. If you think about our industries, skilled trades, you've seen an industry mix shift. And those industries have been growing labor, at a faster rate than the overall economy. But we still think that is potentially the bottleneck for the industry. And it's why we've, quite frankly, constrained our own view of the rate of growth that we think this market is going to see. It could be better, if some of these labor constraints don't materialize. Chris Snyder : Thank you, Craig, appreciate that. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America. You may proceed. Andrew Obin : Hi. Yes. Good morning. Craig Arnold : Morning, Andrew. Olivier Leonetti : Hi, good morning. Andrew Obin : Yes. Just maybe a question for, Craig, you talked about Electrical Americas and mega project impact. So can you quantify or can you just talk about how much did mega projects actually have an impact on your business in 2024? Craig Arnold : Yes. Appreciate the question, Andrew. And one of the reasons why we started reporting mega projects a couple of years ago that we saw this fundamental shift in our industry as the world was going through this massive CapEx rebuild cycle, and the size of the projects just have been much larger than what we've seen historically. And so we thought it was great to take this data and share it externally, as a way of giving you an indication of what we're seeing in our business. And the numbers are growing dramatically, as we reflected in the PowerPoint presentation. But to your point specifically around 2024, our business doubled in mega projects in 2024 to over $600 million. Our negotiation pipeline up some 60%, and if you recall, for the overall business, it's up 41%. So we continue to see an increasing number of projects. And the good news, as we've said many times, is that most of the benefit associated with these mega projects is still out in front of us. And as you saw in the data, the number of projects and the size of the projects continue to grow. And it just - we're really going through a fairly significant CapEx expansion cycle in the U.S. for sure, but around the world. And it's really showing up in these mega projects. Andrew Obin : Thank you. Olivier Leonetti : And I'll add some color. \u2026 Andrew Obin : Yes. Olivier Leonetti : Just, Andrew, just for you in a look forward 2025, just to reinforce what Craig just said, we look at the Dodge data. And in 2024, there were 56 projects that started and around $135 billion in total. And their forecast for this year, for 2025 is actually that we're going to reach over $300 billion in 114 projects. So even if we don't - we tend to haircut the starts, we don't believe in all starts, it's almost doubled at the rate we saw in 2024. So I think that the message from Craig, I think the key point is the longevity of growth cycle ahead of us. I think that's a good way to think about it. Andrew Obin : Thanks so much. And just a question on sort of supply chain, the state of supply chain and I appreciate that you guys are watching, but we recently heard a comment that effectively U.S. market is sucking up capacity, supply chain capacity on the electrical side from all over the world. And the constraint is that while the industry leaders are certainly adding capacity, you still need to incentivize the supply chain, maybe it was better pricing, better margin for them to add capacity. Could you just maybe unpack to us what it is you're saying, how are you incentivizing your supply chain to have capacity in particular at the components at a bottleneck, more critical components? Thanks so much. Craig Arnold : Maybe just building on my commentary earlier, I think today, the nature of our conversations with suppliers is that really providing them the visibility and the certainty that they need to make the investments to support the growth that we're forecasting. And so we're not particularly providing any specific financial incentives, but we are working much more closely with our suppliers in terms of visibility and working through multiyear agreements, which are backed up by multiyear agreements that we also have with our customers. And - but I'd say, by and large, this notion that the U.S. is sucking up capacity from the rest of the world, there's probably some truth to that because clearly, we're seeing a much stronger economy and much more significant growth in the U.S. compared to the rest of the world. That's actually a good balance for Eaton. That's a good thing for us. But - so that comment doesn't surprise me, but this capacity is simply flowing to where the real demand is. Andrew Obin : Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. You may proceed. Steve Tusa : Hi. Good morning. Craig Arnold : Hi, Steve. Steve Tusa : Its almost noon, but anyway, the pipeline you guys talked about in these mega projects, what does that mean for orders as you look forward over the course of this year? I mean is this - obviously, this pipeline keeps growing, and it's massive. The backlog is flattish here. You've been book-to-billing a bit above one, but like what is the visibility on these mega projects and things like that actually like converting into another reacceleration in orders? Paulo Ruiz : Thanks, Steve. This is Paulo. I would say that it's very difficult to forecast orders for mega projects. It will be a bit speculative. But I can give you a sense on what we're seeing. As Craig mentioned, with the negotiation pipeline growing 60%, that's what gives us confidence. Those are large projects. It takes time between announcement and revenues between three and five years, what we said in the past. And since we started following those projects in 2021, 2022, it's to be expected that now we start to see the effect. And as Craig said, our sales doubled in 2024 for mega projects versus 2023. Now to make - to pinpoint the order entry for that would be very difficult, and I don't want to speculate on it. So the best way for us to help you understand this longevity of the cycle is to continue to tell you the mega projects that we see and how the negotiation pipelines are evolving. Steve Tusa : Okay. And then on this - lastly, on this data center thing, the starts you say - you talked about nearly doubling in 2024, I guess, your order is up 75%. So I mean are you like shipping to the starts? Or are you shipping to add to some point in the middle of the project as it gets built? Or are you shipping, like, blanket orders from the hyperscalers where they order a big number and then they distribute as they go? Like, how much visibility do you have as to when you're actually shipping to these guys? Paulo Ruiz : Yes. So thanks for the question again. I think the best way to answer your question is we have multi-year visibility on the forecast. Craig was talking about the forecast we give to our suppliers. We, also, as a supplier to the big data center operators, we were giving a forecast. In some case, we have hard commitment from them. So that's the visibility we have. In terms of sending the product, we're going to send the product as the project requires. We don't ship if the site is not ready, and we follow the construction of the data center. And by saying that, some of our products could come earlier, like the transformers, the switch gear, and then the UPS and what goes inside the server room comes later. So in different phases of the project, I would say. Steve Tusa : Great. All right. Thanks for that. Craig Arnold : So when - that start, yes. When we talk about a start, it's when a shovel goes in the ground. And so we're not shipping anything at that point. But that's when a project becomes real and when a project as you can truly count on it as a project that's likely going to be completed. Steve Tusa : Yes. Okay. Great. Thanks a lot, guys. Craig Arnold : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research. You may proceed. Jeffrey Sprague : Yes. Thanks. Good morning everyone. Maybe just one more on data centers for me, maybe there's others coming in the pipeline. But also, just historically, right, when we were talking about mega projects, it did not include data centers because of that $1 billion threshold. But now, for example, we've got Amazon doing this $16 billion campus in Mississippi and other things. Just wonder if you could give us a sense of how much data center is now in the mega project number that you're sharing with us today, if you have visibility on that? Craig Arnold : Yes. The exact number, I don't - first of all, your thesis is absolutely correct, Jeff, that as these data center projects have become bigger, some of them are now falling into the category of mega projects. And so clearly, we're seeing data centers show up in that category as well. I don't have the exact percentage handy. Yan Jin : Yes, I got. We actually said it on the slide. It's roughly 17%. Craig Arnold : 17%. Okay. Yan Jin : Yes. 17%, 1-7. Craig Arnold : So 17%. But the other thing I would just group and we shared this slide in one of the earlier earnings calls that, we track mega projects $1 billion above, but we also track the balance of projects, which is from $25 million to $1 billion. And we're seeing the same trend in that segment of the market. We're seeing tremendous growth as well in projects in these other categories. And so, clearly, we're seeing more significant growth in mega projects, but we are, in fact, seeing very strong growth in the balance of segment as well. Jeffrey Sprague : Great. And then just looking forward to March. Obviously, you want to save most of it for us. But Paulo, just thinking about Electrical Global specifically. I know you have an aspiration to improve the margins there over time. Obviously, there's just scale and economic advantages to Americas that maybe can't ever be replicated in the global franchise. But what could you share with us about your view of what can be done to kind of improve the margins in Electrical Global and maybe at least narrow the gap versus the Big Brother in the Americas? Paulo Ruiz : Thanks for the question. So first of all, in March, we're going to be talking about our long-range commitments into 2030 for every segment. So you're going to have clarity not only on Electrical Global, but every segment we report. To your question on working on the margins, starting in 2025, we already see an improvement, and this is based on two biggest group of actions. One is the benefits of the restructuring that start to hit the P&L and help us. And other part is as we start shipping those large orders that we have on the data center side specifically, we're also going to have more productivity gains from the volume coming up. There are many other things we can and we will do. One thing is to continue to complete our portfolio and step-by-step, build the same strength we have in North America, but also continue to drive operations. As Craig said, we are never satisfied. We never get complacent. We always drive improvements. There's still a lot to be done there, but not only in global, even Electrical Americas, there's a lot for us to go do. Craig Arnold : And the only thing I would add to that, I think Paulo's absolutely right, is that as you heard in Olivier's commentary, mix has been a bit of a headwind as well for our business there. When you see, obviously, some of the data around the MOEM segment, the manufacturing segment, which tends to be a much higher percentage of our business in Europe, and those markets being down to the extent that they have, that really hurt in that particular region from a profitability. So as that market begins to normalize and recover, we should also see a natural improvement in profitability there as well. Jeffrey Sprague : Right. Thank you. Craig Arnold : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC. You may proceed. Deane Dray : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Craig Arnold : Good morning. Paulo Ruiz : Good morning. Deane Dray : I realize this is a realtime story here, and it's a moving target. But just can you talk about tariffs, potential impact, vulnerabilities, preparation you've gone through already? Paulo Ruiz : Yes, I can talk about that, Deane. So first of all, we are on top of it. We are ready. We know potentially from - depending on what is announced, we know exactly what to trigger. We have - more importantly than that, I think we have a philosophy over time. We moved our production much closer to the consumption side. So that decreases the impact of the tariffs. But we have a playbook. We've done that before. We are ready. We know exactly where the - where to apply commercial actions, and we'll do. We'll fully compensate with commercial actions if necessary. Hopefully not necessary. But if they come to force, we're going to comply, and we're going to compensate with commercial actions. Deane Dray : Great. That's helpful. We'll all be staying tuned there. And then Jeff is right, there was more data center questions. So I just - first of all, that Page 6 was really helpful. Appreciate all those specifics. And Craig, I also appreciated the confidence that you've expressed today about long-term growth prospects in data center. I would have loved to have heard that on Monday as well. But - so we got it today. Just kind of share for us what the team is watching for, for any change at the margin in terms of build-out expectations. I mean, we're watching hyperscale CapEx growth, and you can check the box. Those have been fine in the past couple of weeks. But how about your customers have been asking you for five-year supply agreements, just remind us, those are not take-or-pay, just how are those set up? And whether there's been anything - how you're watching those play-out or any other indicators you think of reporting? Paulo Ruiz : Yes. Thanks for the question, Deane. I would say that the order that comes from our customers to accelerate. And whatever we can do also in terms of technology to model our solutions that could accelerate our build. You heard what Craig said that the industry found ways to accelerate build out, which is great, but they are still sitting on seven years of backlog as of today. So there's more to be done there. In terms of the agreements, it's not exactly take or pay, but there are penalties for order cancellations that are pretty sizable. And I would say, as we look back the last years, we haven't seen a single cancellation here. So most of the discussions we have, including after the news this week, is about continuing to invest, no distraction on the news this week and continue to build. And you see how our negotiation pipeline development is developing in our backlog as well. So I think the way forward continues to be to accelerate the build-outs. Craig Arnold : Yes. The only thing I'd add to that, Paulo is absolutely right. The things that we were concerned about prior to Monday, we're still concerned about today. And the constraints around whether that's power availability, whether that's site availability, whether that's labor availability or where there will be constraints in supply chain. And as I mentioned, we do believe this market could grow much faster than what we're anticipating. And quite frankly, the numbers that \u2026 Paulo Ruiz : Yes. Craig Arnold : \u2026we're getting from our customers are much higher than the numbers that we're baking into our forecast. But we do believe there will be constraints along the way. And those were the things that we were worried about prior to Monday. Those are things that we're still worried about. I think what happened on Monday with DeepSeek, I think it's way too early to know how that will influence the evolution of this market. But as I said in my commentary, if history repeats itself, it should mean faster growth, faster adoption, and it could be a good thing. Deane Dray : That's really helpful. Appreciate it. See you in March. Craig Arnold : Yes. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. You may proceed. Nigel Coe : Thanks. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for all the details. So I really appreciate all these end market perspectives. Just maybe switching gears to Aerospace. So you called out the impact of the Boeing strike in the fourth quarter and obviously the third quarter, too. You are forecasting a deceleration to 79%, still very, very healthy. But given the moving pieces that we have here, I just wondered, if you can maybe just give us some perspective on what you're baking in for OE versus aftermarket and perhaps Commercial versus Military? Paulo Ruiz : Okay. Thanks for the question. So we - as you pointed out, the market is really growing. I think it's important that we give the breakdown. To be specific here, we see a low-double digit in OEM. And we see we see single \u2013 high-single digit in aftermarket. And then in OE, low-double digits for both Military and Commercial. And in terms of the build-out, we watch what our customers are doing. We are ready for the ramp, including Boeing's ramp and also Airbus' ramp. But as Craig said, we also - we got \u2013 as soon as we got prepared for it internally. We also take some caution in what we forecast externally. We don't take their build-outs as per face value. So we are a little more cautious in our forecast. So in that, that was the reason that in 2024 with all the difficulties in the industry in the year and strikes, we still met our commitments for growth for the full year. Nigel Coe : I'm sorry, did you conclude that aftermarket, too? Paulo Ruiz : Can you repeat your question? I couldn't hear. Nigel Coe : Did you - sorry, I heard the OE comments, but what about the aftermarket comments? Paulo Ruiz : Aftermarket will be high single digits. Nigel Coe : Okay. That's helpful. And then just my follow-on is around utility. It seems like it's normalizing down to like a high single-digit range for 2025. It's been running double digits for a long time. Just wondering, maybe just a bit more perspective on what you're seeing in your utility end markets. And maybe just kind of thinking about that capacity expansion as that comes online, is there potential for utility to reaccelerate as you convert some of that backlog? Paulo Ruiz : Okay. Well, thanks for the question again. I'd say I would answer in two steps. The first one, I'm going to remind you and everyone what drives the industry utilities, and then I'm going to talk about the effects at Eaton. So in the first part, I would say what drives growth in utility distribution where we play, there's a big portion of replacement of aging infrastructure that you probably heard about. The second thing that drives the growth is also the hardening of the resilience part. So think about all the natural events, fires, floods, hurricanes, et cetera, duties [ph] that are getting ready to be more resilient to face those issues. The third piece is about the increased energy consumption. Right. And also, that part of that increase also is a data center story, but there's more to it. So that's how the industry plays. If you move that to Eaton and the effects of that in our company, you know that we are heavily weighted to the U.S. distribution network. So we expect this CapEx to be in the high single digits, and it's consistent with a third-party forecast like S&P or EEI, et cetera. And we think this high single digit, I want to give even more clarity because I think it's important as you compare Eaton to other electrical players, we see - within this high single-digit market, we see strong double-digit growth in many of the high end of the offers, which is most of what we do. So think about switchgear, regulators, recloser, capacitor. So that part of the market will continue to grow strongly double digits. And there is an offset on the - more on the lower value add of the chain, which is related to single-phase transformers, those poll transformers or line installation equipment, more the hardware piece than some of our competitors are pretty focused on. So it's a high single-digit growth for us. But there's a double-digit side that we like the most, and the other part of the market is growing not so fastly. If you go outside North America, if you look at global, I would say China continues to invest very heavily in utility, right, both in generation, in renewables and also in transmission and distribution in China. And electricity, electricity consumption is increasing 7%. It's very big for a country of that size. So we also expect a strong growth coming from that side of the world as well. In terms of capacity, we talked about capacity. As part of our investments, we are also adding capacity to utility. And we do that in a modular fashion. We do that in a way that can also serve other markets like a transformer could go into data center, it could go into utilities. Some of the switchgear can be used in other end markets, so we feel good about our prospects and the investments we are making. Nigel Coe : Great. Thanks, Paulo. Super helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank. You may proceed. Nicole DeBlase : Yes, thanks. Good morning, guys. Yan Jin : Good morning. Craig Arnold : Good morning. Olivier Leonetti : Good morning. Nicole DeBlase : Maybe just starting with Americas, margin expansion there really impressive yet again this quarter. I guess the 2025 guidance only embeds like 10 bps to 40 bps of year-on-year expansion. Could you talk a little bit about what's going on there? Is there maybe some conservatism embedded? Or are margins just getting to a point where it's going to be tougher to expand them from these best-in-cost levels? Paulo Ruiz : Thanks, Nicole. So I would say there's always space for us to improve margins, and it's also valid for Electrical Americas. Just think about all the manufacturing efficiencies we can generate on existing facilities, but also the other facilities we are adding to the business, there is still more for us to go do there. So I don't think this is the top margin for the segment. I will reiterate that. This is one. For 2025, most of the growth will come from volume. So if you compared to prior year, starting last year we already had more volume than pricing in our composition for growth. This year, the vast majority will be volume in our breakdown, which is something for you to consider. As pricing normalizes, it\u2019s to be expected. And this year, as we're adding capacity in two dozen projects, we are dealing with inefficiencies of the start-ups and start-up costs. So that's what makes the comparable basis not so strong year-over-year. But as Craig said before, we always drive ourselves to a higher number, and this is not different for Electrical Americas internally. Nicole DeBlase : Thanks, Paulo. That makes sense. And then you mentioned appetite for M&A in the prepared remarks. Could you talk a little bit about the current pipeline and areas of greatest interest? Paulo Ruiz : Sure. I would say our major areas of interest continue to be data centers, utilities and Aerospace, so Electrical and Aerospace. And in terms of the size of the acquisitions, what we're interested in doing in the short and mid-term is to look at bolt-on acquisitions that can accelerate our organic strategy. So Electrical and Aerospace would be the answer. And the size will be more like a bolt-on. And to make a point, bolt-on definition for Eaton moved over time as well since we have a bigger company and a bigger evaluation, but it continues to be the focus of the team. Nicole DeBlase : Thank you, Paulo. I'll pass it on. Paulo Ruiz : Yes. Go ahead. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed. Joe Ritchie : Hi, guys. Good morning. So I'll focus both of my questions on Electrical Americas margins. And so - and if you go back a year ago, we wind the clock, you were expecting margins to be about 300 basis points lower than where we ended up in 2024. So I'm just curious, I know the growth was slightly better, but what other levers really kind of drove that margin expansion this past year? Paulo Ruiz : Yes. First of all, I would say I'm very proud of that team. They're really executing super well. I think that's the first thing I want to say. And they're executing well on the top line. They're also executing well in their operations. So they run the business better than what we expected, right, in the operations. This is one thing. And we continue to drive also our supply chain to better results. So overall, it's an operational performance improvement for the business that drove the extra margin. And that's how we are wired for this year as well. We are dealing with those capacity ramp-ups, which again, they're going well. They've been developing very well. But the team is focused there, and they would be disappointed if they cannot beat their own numbers. So the spirit is still the same. Joe Ritchie : Got it. That's helpful, Paulo. And then I guess just one follow-up. So the backlog is up 29% year-over-year. I mean it's hard to imagine that the margins in the backlog today are lower than the margins in the backlog 12 months ago, but I don't want to put words in your mouth. So is there any color you can kind of give us on what - how the margins look like today in the backlog versus a year ago? Paulo Ruiz : No, they are in line. They are in line with what we are printing today, largely in line. Joe Ritchie : Okay. Great. All right. Thank you guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Davis with Melius Research. You may proceed. Scott Davis : Hi, Guys. I guess, its officially afternoon. So good afternoon. Guys, I just - can you give us a sense - a couple of cleanup items here, but the $900 million in CapEx, how much of that is growth versus maintenance? Is it at a 700, 600 growth, the rest maintenance? Is that a way to think about it? I don't think we've carved that up in the past. Olivier Leonetti : Largely, the 900 is going to be gross CapEx. The large proportion of that is going to be growth. The team is doing a good job actually rationalizing our CapEx investments. We have managed the tail that has been a principle that Craig has implemented for a number of years. So most of the CapEx would be growth. I would say 80%. Scott Davis : Okay, 80%. That sounds about right. Does - guys, it's completely different from the conversation today, but does it still make the same sense to have eMobility as a standalone segment today as it did when your first data - gosh, I can't remember when it was like, 6 years ago or maybe 7 years ago. But it seems - is there still - does it still make the most sense to have that as a standalone and operationally standalone? Olivier Leonetti : So there are two questions. The first one is how do we run that. That's a separate question. From a reporting standpoint, the dynamic of those two businesses is very different. And we want to show to our investors how those two businesses are evolving. Again, they have the same - different margin profile, different growth profile. So externally, we will keep doing what we do today. Paulo Ruiz : But internally, to your point, we are maximizing the way we run it for synergies, for SG&A savings. And we also use the Electrical and Vehicle businesses, one hedging, one another. We experienced lower demand on EVs. And then our Internal Combustion Engine business could benefit on the programs in the long run. But we believe we continue to give you the transparency we started giving you years ago. I think it will be beneficial for all. Craig Arnold : And just keep in mind \u2026 Scott Davis : Okay. Thanks guys. Craig Arnold : The technology synergy in many ways is more akin to our Electrical business than it is to our Vehicle business. And so \u2026 Scott Davis : Yes. Craig Arnold : There is the customer piece, obviously, much greater affinity with legacy Vehicle, but from a technology and a product standpoint, much greater connectivity to the Electrical business. Scott Davis : Okay. That makes sense. We'll see you guys in March. Thank you very much. Craig Arnold : Thank you, Scott. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. You may proceed. Julian Mitchell : Hi. Good afternoon. I know it's been an hour, so I'll keep these questions short. First one just on Slide 6 again, I just wanted to double check the 45% data center sales growth number on the left-hand side. Just wanted to check what the sort of base revenue figure for 2023 that applied to? Because I know you've given a sort of $3.3 billion number before. But 45% growth on that would imply all the Electrical sales growth was from data center, which I think it was broader based than that. So any sort of help around that, please? Craig Arnold : Hi. No, appreciate the question, Julian. Sometimes it's tough to make all, the math, but the first thing, probably the point of clarification in terms of when we provide you data on segments. The data segment numbers that we report, as a percentage of the total company, it's not only centers, but it includes the IT channel. So you can't take that number and extrapolate what happens in the balance of the businesses, because that data center number is not only the data center segment. But the way to think about it, I think what you're trying to get to is that, what was the growth in the balance of the businesses when you strip out data centers. And what I would tell you that, very much like we covered in my chart in my presentation where I talked about how these markets performed relative to our expectations, we saw good growth in Commercial and Institutional. We had like high single-digit numbers in utility. We have high-single, low double-digit numbers. We saw good growth in Industrial, more mid-single, but that's offset by some declines in the legacy Vehicle business. It was offset by declines in residential. It was offset by declines in MOEM. And so it really is, once again, very much consistent with what I laid out on Slide 4 in the deck, our business has performed largely in line with those market numbers. But we do appreciate the question, because we know sometimes it's difficult to make the math foot. Julian Mitchell : That's very helpful. And based on the sort of capacity expansions you talked about and the orders' strength in data center, when we're thinking about sort of the 2025 Electrical revenue growth guide, is that assuming a sort of similar-ish, very strong growth rate in data center this year as well? Paulo Ruiz : True. Yes. The answer is yes. Julian Mitchell : Perfect. Paulo Ruiz : We may not be counting on the same rate of growth as we experienced this year, but still very, very strong growth. Julian Mitchell : Got it. And then one last fiddly one. Aerospace, flat margins for three years, guided to expand this year. Any color on the drivers, please? Paulo Ruiz : Sure. Julian, I think the biggest driver here is operational performance. We were not satisfied with our - the way we run our facilities. The whole industry also went through difficulties in the last year. So there's still inefficiencies for us to go deal with. But if you look at what we did in Vehicle over time in even more difficult environment, we managed to move margins up. So that's the mandate of the new management team to do the exactly the same we did in Vehicle in Aerospace with the biggest advantage than Aerospace, we count on much more predictable orders. We have a very large backlog, and we can drive our own destiny here. So I think most of the margin improvement moving forward will be our homework that we need to do. And that's the reason why we appointed the leaders we appointed in John Sapp in Aerospace, but also for Pete Denk, who led our Vehicle business before to lead the industrial sector. That's their mandate. Julian Mitchell : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you .Our next question comes from Chad Dillard with Bernstein. You may proceed. Chad Dillard : Hi, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. So as AI data center shift from training to inferencing, and look, I know we can debate the pace at which it happens, but how does the Electrical content and intensity differ between like these two different use cases? Or maybe does doesn't even differ at all? I guess I'm trying to understand like what your products would you sell more of or less of depending on the use cases. And maybe before you answer this question, how much of your data center sales are cloud versus AI? Paulo Ruiz : Okay. So let me clarify the question. You asked us before whether changes like DeepSeek would change what we sell. Is that the first part of the question versus the second part? Chad Dillard : Yes. It's the shift from like training to inferencing. Just trying to understand like the difference in Electrical content intensity products. Paulo Ruiz : Okay. So great. So for us, I would say - I would comment on this as those breakthroughs like DeepSeek are to be expected. That's the first thing I would say. We'll see more of that coming up. And we believe when there is more adoption, as you probably are suggesting, we're going to have more inference data centers than training data centers. But within the data center, we saw the exact same portfolio, right, exact same portfolio. And what could be interesting - I'm not making an industry forecast here because it's too early. But if you have higher adoption and the data centers are built faster, the inference data centers, most of the bottlenecks that actually create the biggest headache for data center operators will vastly go away. Instead of trying to accommodate gigawatts training centers, if you can accommodate much smaller energy consuming inference centers, the build could accelerate, and that could be a very good thing for us as well. But basically, it will be the same transformers, it would be the same switch gear. It will be the same UPS inside the server hall and the software, et cetera. It's the same portfolio, no disruption there. Having said that, where we are actually working really closely with our hyperscale and multi-tenant data centers is how do we help them building faster, growing their builds and be able to develop this large backlog of seven years in a nice way. That's the focus. But we got calls with our key customers after Monday. The sentiment is still the same. Nothing changed. We keep pushing forward. Chad Dillard : Got it. That's super helpful. And just like one quick one. I know lead time has been talked a little bit today, but where are they for some of like the core products like switchgear transformers? And once the capacity adds come online in the second half of this year, where you expect that lead time to go? Paulo Ruiz : Yes. So, as we commented before, we have two dozen projects. Some are expansion of our plants. Some are new plants that we are building. And although there is no cliff event of a large one single facility that will move the needle, we see more of that capacity coming online in the second half. I think that's the best answer I can give you. And yes, we\u2026 Chad Dillard : Thank you. Paulo Ruiz : We today we look at lead times. We continue to work on them. I think we are competitive, but they remain higher than historical levels, and we want to drive them down. Chad Dillard : Thank you. Paulo Ruiz : Welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Andy Kaplowitz with Citi. You may proceed. Andy Kaplowitz : Hi. Good afternoon, guys. Craig Arnold : Good afternoon. Andy Kaplowitz : I think last quarter you talked about machine builders in Europe and residential starting to bottom out. But obviously, you moved residential to negative for 2025 from your initial assumptions like growth. So did those markets get worse again through Q4? Are they just not recovering yet? And then alternatively, it looks like China continues to hold up for you. I think you mentioned utilities. Maybe anything else that you're seeing over there? Craig Arnold : Yes. I'd say that in terms of what happened at the end of the year, which has us incrementally less enthusiastic in resi, as the Fed cut interest rates, everyone expected that to translate to an improvement in the residential market and borrowing costs for consumers. And that, quite frankly, hasn't happened as we all know. And so I'd say on the margin, resi got a bit weaker during Q4. And I'd say on the MOEM segment, more or less a bottoming out, we think. And maybe there are some green shoots in MOEM. But specifically in resi, we've become less bullish on the resi recovery, given the fact that interest rates have remained stubbornly high. Andy Kaplowitz : That's helpful. And then backlog up 29% Electrical Americas as the end of this year. I think it was up 18% last year at this time, yet you're forecasting slightly slower organic growth in 2025 versus 2024. I know you had some hurricane disruption in Q4 slowing revenue a bit. But was there anything else that slowed revenue in the quarter? And then is the modestly lower forecast just a reflection of conservatism or maybe larger projects with longer duration? Paulo Ruiz : Yes. I would say for the Q4, as Craig mentioned, we had some weaknesses in resi in the low cycle business. And as we look forward, we continue to count on most of our markets growing nicely. We have a very strong backlog. I would reiterate that. And with the capacity, our plants running better, the ones we have and the expansions, we are confident in the outlook we are putting out for the 11.5% at midpoint. Craig Arnold : And the other point I'll just raise and we mentioned it earlier is that historically, we were living in an inflationary environment. We were getting more price, and we've simply anniversaried a number of those price increases from prior years. And quite frankly, our volumes are actually, as we look forward, as Olivier mentioned in his commentary, contributing more to our growth and most of our growth going forward. So a big difference is also the relative amount of price that we're experiencing in the business because we simply don't have as much inflation as we've had historically. Andy Kaplowitz : Appreciate the color, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from David Raso with Evercore ISI. You may proceed. David Raso : Hi. I'll be quick. I know it's late, sorry. The amount of capacity being added, can you quantify to any degree across Electrical? I don't think you've ever actually heard what percent capacity do we think is coming on across Electrical second half of 2025 and then what the full year impact should be in 2026. And then to dovetail off the comment sort of normalized now on pricing, this is more of a volume story. When I think what you're describing in the next couple of years on the Electrical businesses, your willingness to add capacity and you're already hinting at we'll see if - how it plays out some cyclical recovery in your other businesses. Is there any reason to be thinking that you don't see this organic sales growth rate, for say, 2025 as structurally something the company can do for multiple years? Craig Arnold : Yes. We had this question last quarter as well, Dave. So I appreciate the question around capacity additions. And you're right, we've not expressed it in terms of a percentage of capacity increase on the base of our total capacity. It's just - I think those numbers become meaningless when you look at it in the context of our total manufacturing capacity and some 200 facilities or more facilities around the world. But what we said is that where we have capacity constraints, we have made investments that are multiyear investments that more than provide for the capacity to cover our growth forecast in those industries. And so where we're tight in markets like data center and products like transformers, we've made sizable commitments to investments that allow us to cover where we are today and a multiyear view of the capacity that we're going to need. And so the company, as we committed last time, we're in good shape. We will not be the bottleneck in the industry. We're making these capacity investments. We talked about $1.5 billion of incremental growth capacity that we're putting into the businesses. And that will cover our forecast and provide upside if markets tend to be a bit stronger than what we're forecasting. Paulo Ruiz : And just to complement the - Craig explained really well and the look forward that you're trying to imply, we're going to talk about that in March in our Investor Day. We're going to give you the breakdown of segments, how we see the world until 2030. David Raso : Okay. I appreciate it. Thank you so much. Paulo Ruiz : Thanks, David. Operator : Thank you. And our last question comes from Phil Buller with Berenberg. You may proceed. Phil Buller : Thank you. Thank you for squeezing me in. There's obviously been some part of the business which have been soft, if not very soft for some time. So from what you're seeing on the ground, have there been any green shoots this quarter or market share gains perhaps that you can talk to in European Electrical, European machine OEMs, resi or autos? I think Craig, you talked to Andy's question on some of that, but perhaps more to the U.S. side, but can you specifically talk to what you're seeing in Europe or non-U.S. please? And just as a follow-up, I appreciate this isn't a strategy call, but it was discussed that M&A was going to be focused on Electrical and Aero. So I guess I'm wondering on - if the strategic importance of the automotive exposure is something that you're going to be looking to talk to at the Investor Day in March. Thanks. Craig Arnold : Hi. So maybe just on the green shoot question and specifically as it relates to Europe, you're right, that market has been soft for some time. Most of the industrial data coming out of Europe and Germany specifically continues to be quite weak. Although having said that, as you saw in our own numbers and you see in our outlook in terms of our forecast, we do expect that market to be incrementally better in 2025 than it was in 2024. And we are seeing a little bit of recovery in the machinery OEM market. We are seeing a little bit of recovery in some of the residential pieces of the European business, but still not growth there. But - so I think at this point, we'll have to wait and see. And we remain cautious specifically on Europe, given the macroeconomic environment there where we are forecasting growth. It's largely because they, too are benefiting from data centers. They, what's happening in the utility market. And they're seeing some of the same macro megatrends driving growth in their business that we're seeing in the U.S. market and some of those are accelerating. Phil Buller : Thank you. Paulo Ruiz : Yes. We're going to talk about the Vehicle, eMobility in our Investor Day. That was the second part of your question. I'll talk about it in March. Phil Buller : Okay. Great. Thanks very much guys. Paulo Ruiz : Thank you. Craig Arnold : Thank you. Yan Jin : Hi. Thanks, guys. We do appreciate everybody's questions. As always, the IR team will be available to address your follow-up questions. Thanks for joining us. Have a good day. Operator : Thank you. This concludes the conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
