(Operator instructions) It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Mr. Lee McEntire. Please go ahead. Lee McEntire : Good morning, thanks for joining us on the web as well as the phone this morning. Before I turn the call over to CEO, Brian Moynihan and CFO Bruce Thompson, let me just say that we may make some forward-looking statements. For details on those I will refer you to our Page 24 and 25 in our earnings deck material, either the website or our SEC filings. With that I\u2019ll turn it over to Brian. Brian Moynihan : Thank you, Lee. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us to review the first quarter results. As you can see from our numbers, we report a loss this quarter. That loss reflects the cost of resolving more of our legacy mortgage issues, as well as adding reserves primarily for previously disclosed legacy mortgage related matters. As disappointed as we are in the bottom-line results; we\u2019re pleased to report that the businesses reported earnings at a level that will allow us to substantially offset these losses. And also at the same time we were able to sell grow and improve our Basel III standardized regulatory capital ratio during the quarter. Bruce will take you through the particulars of our results. But first I want to spend a couple of minutes looking at the progress we continue to make across the customer groups that we serve. In particular, we added some slides to the appendix on pages 17 and 18, which highlight multi-year trends across our customer groups. Let me just touch on a few of those and connect them to our results. When you think about broad consumer franchise for mass-market consumers, affluent and wealthy consumers, as we think about the mass-market group, the strategy in our retail segment has been to lower the cost of service, so we could improve our customer experience. We do that by continuing to optimize our delivery networks of all types in response to customer behavior changes. Banking centers and basic teller transactions continue to decline as customers move their business to mobile and online transactions. Yet we still have many millions of visits each week to our branches. But in the aggregate, our self-service channels of ATM, online and mobile transactions continue to grow.  This quarter, more than 10%, of all of the deposit transactions that consumers make in our Company are now done through mobile devices, as people effectively carry a branch in their pocket. This, coupled with other measures allowed us to reduce our cost in our consumer banking business, 4% from last year\u2019s first quarter. It allows us to continue to invest in other areas to further improve customer satisfaction and grow sales. On the preferred side of our consumer business, where we serve mass-affluent clients we continue investing in this group by adding sales specialists. We now have more than 6500 sales specialists concentrated in the top banking centers. We have also increased service associates to drive satisfaction of these clients as well. The end result, when you put all consumer business together is a segment -- is organic deposit growth of $23 billion from last year to a total of $535 billion in deposits. On investment side of this general consumer client base, our Merrill Edge assets grew 21% from last year. When we put the segment together, the earnings in our consumer and business banking business improved 50% year-over-year to nearly $1.7 billion this quarter. As we move to the wealthy part of our consumer client base, in our wealth management business with U.S. Trust of Merrill Lynch, client balances again grew this quarter and now total over $2.4 trillion. This has driven record asset management fees in the segment and we are seeing growing demand from these customers for other banking products as loans and deposits continue to increase. This business made over $700 million after tax this quarter and had a pre-tax margin of more than 25% for the fifth consecutive quarter. We will move to our Company side of our house, our commercial and corporate client base. We continue to retain our leadership position investment banking fees with $1.5 billion in fees received this quarter. We also saw solid loan and deposit flows this quarter from our commercial customers. These activities drove a 6% increase in revenue in our global banking business from last year. In a global markets business, which serves investing clients, we are at $1.3 billion after tax, as our top tier sales and trading platforms generated over $4 billion in revenue this quarter. So we put it all together, we have leadership positions that we continue to work on in each area and continue to see good momentum across the year quarter. We\u2019re pleased also to be in a position of returning capital to shareholders as we increased dividends in addition to our newly authorized share purchase program. As usual, as we say each quarter, we remain focused on executing the strategy to connect the capabilities of this company with its customers and shareholders for your benefit.  With that, I want to turn it over to Bruce to cover the earnings results. Bruce Thompson : Thanks, Brian, and good morning everyone. I\u2019m going to start on Slide 2, and work through the first quarter results. We did record a loss of $276 million, or $0.05 per diluted share this quarter. Driving the loss during the quarter was litigation expense of $6 billion, which cost us roughly $0.40 a share during the quarter. We recorded $3.6 billion in litigation expense for the previously announced FHFA settlement and we recorded another $2.4 billion primarily associated with the increase in reserves for previously disclosed legacy mortgage related matters. Revenue during the quarter on an FTE basis was $22.8 billion, which was $1.1 billion higher than the fourth quarter of \u201913, but below the $23.4 billion we saw in the first quarter of 2013. On a linked quarter basis, our revenues benefitted from improved sales and trading results in asset management fees and were offset by lower net interest income as well as lower mortgage banking revenue. Compared to the prior year period, revenue was down slightly on lower net interest income, mortgage revenue in sales and trading, but did benefit from higher asset management fees. Total non-interest expense during the quarter was $22.2 billion but did include $6 billion of litigation expense, as well as $1 billion of retirement eligible incentive cost that we recognized during the first quarter of each year. If we exclude these items from both the first quarter periods, for comparability of the underlying trends that we saw within the Company, expenses did improve by $1.2 billion, or 7% and were driven by lower LAS non-litigation cost as well as some of the new BAC improvements that we saw. Versus the fourth quarter of \u201913, the slight increase in non-interest expense reflects increased revenue related compensation in our markets business and was partially offset by the decline that we saw in our LAS non-litigation expense reductions. Provision for credit losses was $1 billion during the quarter and increased $673 million versus the fourth quarter of 2013. In the first quarter of this year, we released $379 million from our loan loss reserves and that compares to a release of $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter of 2013. Before we move off of this slide, let me mention that we had a few other items in the quarter that in the aggregate benefited EPS by above $0.04 a share, as higher equity and debt security gains, net DVA and the resolution of tax matters were positives and they were offset in part, by the cost of retirement eligible incentives, as well as the negative market related impacts on our net interest income. One last point on FBO and DVA. This quarter and moving forward, we report the net impact of these two items as one net DVA valuation number for derivatives and structured liabilities within our global markets business. On Slide 3, you can see our period end balance sheet increased from the end of 2013 as we grew both cash and securities in light of increasing liquidity requirements in our primary banking subsidiaries. Ending loans declined $12 billion led by lower residential mortgages, principally within our discretionary loan portfolio, as well as seasonal declines in credit cards. Loans were up in our global banking segment which I\u2019ll cover in a bit. Period end deposits were up $40 billion from the fourth quarter and are up year-over-year by more than $38 billion. Our tangible common equity ratio declined to 7% due to the increase in liquidity that I mentioned earlier. Tangible book value did increase slightly during the quarter and we repurchased 87 million shares for $1.4 billion, which completed our share repurchase program that we established at this time last year. In following our CCAR results, we announced a new $4 billion share repurchase plan as well as the intention to increase the quarterly common dividend to a nickel a share in the second quarter of 2014. We move to Slide 4, we look at our capital ratios under Basel III. Recall this is the first period reporting under Basel III transition which became effective January 1 of this year. Under the transition rules, our common equity Tier I capital was a $151.6 billion, well risk weighted assets were $1.28 trillion, which resulted in a [audio gap] we move to the advanced method, our CET1 ratio was 9.9% and was impacted by the increased level of risk weighted assets related to operational risk, which were largely offset by reduction in other risk weighted assets, as well as the increase in capital. We move to supplementary leverage ratios, we estimate at the end of the first quarter of \u201914 we exceed the recently updated U.S. rule that apply in 2018. Once again that would mean our bank holding company is above the 5% minimum and our primary banking subsidiary BANA and FIA are both in excess of their 6% minimums. I also want to remind you that our tier one capital and supplemental leverage ratios will benefit by approximately $2.9 billion in the second quarter of \u201914 if we receive shareholder approval to amend our series T preferred stock. One last item I want to note regarding capital in the first quarter of \u201914, it includes the adjustment, the capital allocations across our business line. We included a slide in the appendix that notes the new allocation. As you look at that, you\u2019ll see that the primary adjustments were allocating more capital to our global banking business given the loan growth we\u2019ve seen in that segment and to a lesser extent increases in both our global market as well as our global wealth management business. As a result of these changes, the amount of unallocated capital that tell that\u2019s held at the parent declined from $16 billion to $5 billion at the end of the first quarter of 2014. We move to the Slide 5, funding and liquidity. Our global excess liquidity sources increased more than $50 billion to a record level of $427 billion as a result of seasonally strong deposit flows as well as some of the bank debt issuance that we did earlier in the quarter. Our total long term debt of $255 billion was $5 billion higher than the fourth quarter of 2013. These figures do not include the $7.6 billion of debt issuance that settled on April 1st, and was executed at more favorable spread than our existing debt footprint. That issuance has enabled us to maintain our strong excess liquidity position of the parent despite the cash flows required by both scheduled debt maturities as well as recent litigation settlement. Our time to acquire funding remained very strong at 35 months, with parent company liquidity unchanged at $95 billion. Moving forward and as we consider the FHFA settlement, we would expect parent issuance to be below maturity as the focus evolves towards continued yield improvement following the past several years of sizeable balance reductions within our debt footprint. We move to Slide 6 on net interest income. Net interest income on a reported FTE basis was $10.3 billion, which was a decline of $700 million from the fourth quarter of 2013. That decline was driven by a swing of roughly $500 million associated with our market related adjustment or FAS 91. FAS 91 was approximately $300 million negative in the first quarter of \u201914, compared to the $200 million benefit that we saw in the fourth quarter of \u201913. The balance of the decline was largely due to two less interest accrual days in the first quarter of \u201914 relative to the fourth quarter of \u201913. Our net interest income, if we exclude those market related adjustments was $10.6 billion, once again down a little over $200 million from the fourth quarter of \u201913. Other drivers in the quarter were lower average consumer balances in yields which were largely offset by a reduction in long term debt cost as well as continued decline in our deposit pricing. As a result of these net interest income impacts, as well as the higher earning assets, the net interest yield, once again adjusting for FAS 91, declined 3 basis points to 0.36% in the first quarter of \u201914. As it relates to asset sensitivity in the balance sheet, we continue to remain poised to benefit from higher rates particularly when the short end of the curve moves up. As we continue to manage our OCI sensitivity, we\u2019re also mindful of both liquidity and leverage roles. Our first quarter 2014 increase in securities included shorter duration treasury security, instead of mortgage backed securities and these treasury securities are much more LCR and OCI friendly but do have lower yields. Given the continued growth that we\u2019ve seen in our cash balances at central banks as we increase liquidity, we have adjusted our net interest yield to reflect the impact of adding these low yielding cash deposits once again at central banks into earning assets. This had no impact on net interest income, but prior period net interest yields have been adjusted to reflect the change. Given the added liquidity during the quarter coupled with the average balance impact of seasonally lower consumer balances, we expect net interest income in the second quarter of \u201914 may be slightly lower compared to this quarter\u2019s $10.6 billion level, excluding market related adjustments before moving up modestly throughout the second half of 2014. We move to our expense highlights on Slide 7. Non-interest expense was $22.2 billion in the first quarter of \u201814 and once again included $6 billion charge for litigation expense and $1 billion cost for retirement eligible incentives. As previously mentioned, $6 billion litigation expense did include the cost of the FHFA settlement as well as $2.4 billion in increased reserves associated with our previously disclosed legacy mortgage related matters. If we exclude the litigation in retirement eligible incentive cost, our total expenses were $15.2 billion and declined $1.2 billion from the first quarter of \u201813 driven by lower LAS cost, but were up roughly 200 million from the fourth quarter of \u201813 on incentives related to improved sales and trading revenue. Legacy assets and servicing cost ex-litigation of $1.6 billion declined more than $250 million from the fourth quarter of 2013. As you look at that $1.6 billion number, the savings we generated during the quarter were 40% of our targeted quarterly reductions that we\u2019ve communicated to you previously. We continue to make progress on cost savings and as a result, our expense program targets for New BAC as well as LAS remain unchanged. Turning to Slide 8; you can see our credit quality continue to improve again. Net charge offs declined $194 million to $1.4 billion or a 62 basis point net loss ratio. Delinquencies, a leading indicator of charge offs showed improvement again as well. In our first quarter of \u201914, provision expense was $1.0 billion and we released approximately $400 million of reserves during the quarter. Looking forward, we would expect provision expense for the balance of the year to reflect both modest reductions in net charge-offs as well as reserve releases. Let\u2019s move to Slide 9 and go through the different business segments, starting with consumer and business banking. Net income of nearly $1.7 billion in the first quarter of \u201814 was up 15% from the first quarter of 2013. Lower expenses, higher service charges a portfolio divestiture gain in lower credit costs all drove that improvement in the first quarter of \u201813. Return on allocated capital within the segment remains very strong at 23% this quarter. As we reflect on customer activity during the quarter, mobile banking customers grew 19% from the first quarter of 2013 to 15 million customers and customer deposit transactions using these devices now represent 10% of all transactions. Average deposits of $535 billion are up organically $23 billion or 5% compared to the first quarter of \u201813 and our rates paid were reduced nearly in half to 7 basis points. Our brokerage assets surpassed the $100 billion in the quarter and are up 21% year-over-year with the growth split fairly evenly between both increases in flows as well as valuations within the market. Our card issuance remains strong at a million new accounts in the first quarter of 2014 but our ended period balances are down seasonally from the fourth quarter of 2013. Importantly, our risk adjusted margin remained above 9%. Overall our credit quality within this segment remained strong as our net charge offs declined versus both the linked quarter period as well as the year ago period. Provision expense was $812 million during the quarter. Net charge offs improved $360 million from the year ago quarter and we released $69 million in reserves this quarter which is $220 million less than the first quarter of last year and down $426 million from the fourth quarter of \u201813. One litigation item to note before we move off the consumer results is the resolution we reached last week with the CFPB and the OCC on issues related to the marketing, sale and billing of credit cards, debt cancellation, ID theft protection products. This settlement included cash payments to both regulators and provides for redress the customers and was covered by reserves that had been established in prior periods. We move to Slide 10; consumer real estate services. The higher loss in the quarter was driven by $5.8 billion of litigation within the segment. Let\u2019s first focus on the reported sub-segment of home loans where we recorded the origination of consumer real estate. Our first mortgage retail originations of $8.9 billion were down 24% from the fourth quarter of \u201913, in-line with overall market demand and drove a 32% reduction in core production revenue as margins held relatively steady compared to the fourth quarter of \u201913. We continue to reduce production staffing levels in the quarter, consistent with the volumes that we\u2019re seeing but those expenses will flow through the P&L immediately. Home equity originations of $2 billion were up from the fourth quarter of \u201813 level. We moved the legacy assets in servicing sub-segment. Once again the driver here is the previously mentioned litigation cost. On litigation cost, you saw the press release on March 26th regarding our settlement with FHFA, which identified the $6.3 billion payment and led to the $3.6 million litigation charge this quarter. We\u2019re obviously pleased to have this matter put behind us. Within our earnings release, we also included information regarding a settlement with FGIC and related parties on involved securitization trust which resolves all outstanding litigation in rep and warrant claims on second lean loans for approximately $900 million to $950 million depending on the final outcome of two of the remaining trust, two of the nine remaining trusts excuse me. This settlement was covered by reserves that we had established in previous periods. The primary revenue component within the LAS sub-segment servicing revenue declined $205 million versus the fourth quarter as the size of our servicing portfolio continues to decline as it aligns with our market share of production and we also have less favorable MSR net hedge performance during the quarter. Also impacting revenue during the quarter was rep and warrant expense of $178 million, which increased by roughly $100 million from the fourth quarter of \u201913, given the settlement during the quarter with FHFA. From a cost of servicing perspective, our 60 plus day delinquent loans will reduce by 15%, 277,000 units at the end of the first quarter of 2014 and once again our LAS expense ex-litigation declined $262 million to $1.6 billion. We move to Slide 11, global wealth and investment management. During the quarter we achieved record revenue of $4.5 billion, which was up 3% from the first quarter of \u201813 and 2% from the fourth quarter of \u201813. The improvement was driven by record asset management fees during the quarter. Net income of $729 million was slightly higher than the first quarter of \u201813 but was down modestly from the fourth quarter of \u201813 as expense was 3% higher than both periods. Expense increase compared to both periods and higher revenue related incentives increased volume related cost as well as certain investments in technology. Notwithstanding those increases, our pretax margin remains strong, north of 25% for the fifth consecutive quarter. Our return on allocated capital was 25% but declined from prior period as the relative earnings stability was coupled with the increased capital allocations that I mentioned previously. Client engagement remains strong in the markets providing additional tailwind as our client balances increased $30 billion from the year-end 2013 to $2.4 trillion. Long-term AUM flows of $17.4 billion for the quarter were the second highest in our Company\u2019s history. Ending client loan balances of $120 billion reached record levels and are up 9% year-over-year. One other highlight I\u2019d like to mention is the coordinated referral efforts that we\u2019re seeing across wealth management and the banking groups as we funded more than 300 institutional retirement plans worth more than 2.4 billion in client assets during the quarter. On Slide 12 global banking, earnings during the quarter were $1.24 billion. Earnings compared to the first quarter of \u201813 show a 6% improvement in revenue that were offset by higher expense. Investment banking fees for the quarter were $1.54 billion, consistent with what we saw during the first quarter of \u201813 but 11% lower than the record level that we saw during the fourth quarter of \u201913. We do believe for the second consecutive quarter, this would rank us as a global leader in investment banking fees. The remaining revenue drivers in this business, treasury services and business lending show very positive trends year-over-year across both our commercial as well as our corporate client base. You can see some of these metrics on Page 26 of the supplemental information that we provide to you. Provision was up $160 million from the first quarter of \u201913, driven by additions to our loan loss reserves. The first quarter of \u201914 included a build of $282 million, versus the build of $81 million in the first quarter of \u201913 and $434 million in the fourth quarter of \u201913. The expense increase in the quarter of $186 million on a year-over-year basis relates to investments in technology for our global treasury services and lending platforms, additional client basing personnel and to a lesser degree some litigation that we saw during the quarter within this segment. When you look at the balance sheet, average loans are up $27.4 billion or 11% compared to the first quarter of \u201913 and are up $2.6 billion compared to the fourth quarter of \u201913. The overall pace of growth that we\u2019re seeing has slowed from the past few quarters as pricing for loans is quite competitive and we\u2019ve chosen returns over growth in certain cases. Return on allocated capital was 16% and is down from prior periods reflecting stable earnings that were more than offset by a 35% increase in allocated capital.  : Our rates and currencies experienced declines from market volumes and lower volatility during the quarter. I would note that our fixed business did increase 42% over the fourth quarter of 2013. Equity sales and trading, flat with the first quarter of 2013 and up 28% from the fourth quarter of \u201913. Expenses were stable compared to the first quarter of \u201913 and when we compare expenses to the fourth quarter of \u201913, they increased $453 million on higher revenue related expenses after excluding litigation of $655 million that we recorded in the fourth quarter of \u201913 within this segment. Our trading related assets on average remain flat at $440 billion on a linked quarter basis. Our return on allocated capital during the quarter was 16%, even after we consider a 13% increase in allocated capital. On Slide 14, we show all other. Revenue was down $193 million in the fourth quarter of \u201913 on lower net interest income which was driven by the swing in market related adjustments that I discussed earlier and was partially offset by higher equity investment gains which were driven by the final monetization of an investment. First quarter \u201914 expense includes the retirement eligible incentive cost, which are in line with last year but still drive the expense variance compared to the fourth quarter of \u201913 and was partially offset by lower litigation cost. Provision benefit in the quarter was relatively flat to the fourth quarter of \u201913 but did improve $385 million from the first quarter of \u201913. Net charge-offs of $206 million improved $88 million from the fourth quarter of \u201913 and $279 million in the first quarter of \u201913. Our first quarter of \u201914 results in this segment included $341 million reserve release, compared to a release of $482 million in the fourth quarter and $235 million in the first quarter of \u201913. During the quarter our effective tax rate was impacted by our loss position. For the rest of 2014, we would expect an effective tax rate of approximately 31%, absent any unusual items.  We\u2019ll make a few comments before we open it up for questions. We obviously don\u2019t like to report a loss to shareholders but this quarter we achieved resolution of rulings around significant legacy matters. FHFA, FGIC, CFPB and OCC, as well as the positive court ruling on Bank of New York Mellon private label securities matters which is under appeal just to name a few. We established additional reserves to help address previously disclosed mortgage related issues and we did that and still built our already strong Basel III standardized capital ratio. Our supplemental leverage ratios at both parent and banks are compliant well and advanced of the 2018 implementation date, under the more stringent new rule. Our liquidity is at record levels and we\u2019re well positioned to meet the new LTR requirements. Asset quality is strong in improving. Our expense program show good progress and most importantly, four of our five operating segments reported revenue and earnings that were essentially flat or higher than the prior year. In our fifth segment, legacy assets and servicing, we made progress on legacy issues, we drove down 60 days plus delinquent loan and our cost excluding litigation declined $1 billion from last year\u2019s first quarter. So as we move into the second quarter of this year, we feel that we\u2019re better positioned than we were coming into 2014. And with that we will go ahead and open it up for questions. Operator : (Operator Instructions) And we\u2019ll go first to Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley : Couple of questions. One on the litigation reserve bill that you did in the quarter. You mentioned that FGIC and the trust settlement were fully reserved for. So that means that none of the 2.4 billion increase reserves in 1Q that you called out was for that settlement? Bruce Thompson : That\u2019s correct. As we said, substantially all of the $2.4 billion related to a bill in our litigation reserves for matters that we\u2019ve disclosed previously. Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley : And I guess, I\u2019m just wondering, if you could give us a sense or color as to what you\u2019re referring to there. It doesn\u2019t look like it went to the monolines or the PLS. So it is something that\u2019s broadly mortgage related or is it something else? And given that it\u2019s such a large reserve bill, does it suggest that there\u2019s another settlement in the near term? Bruce Thompson : You bring up a good point. It does not relate to the previously announced Article 77. It is not relate to the remaining monoline exposure given that we settled the FGIC exposure within the context of our reserve level. So it relates to other mortgage related matters, outside of those that we have disclosed previously. Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley : Okay. Bruce Thompson : And I wouldn\u2019t interpret or not fairly assume that the bills and reserve suggest that the settlement is limited. Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley : Okay. Just moving to capital on Basel III, you give us some great information on transitional to the fully phased in walk there and the appendix. I guess I\u2019m just wondering, you did narrow the gap between the standardized and advanced by 30 bps. Could you run through how you did that in the quarter? Bruce Thompson : Sure. I think if you -- obviously the numerator in both is the same and we saw -- during the quarter we saw improvement in OCI as a numerator and we saw some significant improvement in our threshold deductions. That numerator applies to both standardized as well as the advance approaches. If you look at the standardized risk weighted asset, the big driver down there related to the reduction in our consumer real-estate, both first mortgage, as well as home equity and those portfolios reduced from longer dated assets. In addition, you had the seasonal decline within the card portfolio that helped and that was moderated a little bit by the growth that we saw in commercial loan. So I think as you look at that Basel III standardized ratio, what was driving risk weighted assets were actual reduction in exposure. There wasn\u2019t anything related to models or assumptions that factored into that. If you move over to the advanced approach, where we reported at 9.9%, which was down a touch, the biggest change and we continue to work with and look to refine and take guidance that we\u2019re getting with respect to operational risk, the operational risk -- the operational risk weighted assets during the quarter as we continue to refine that, we\u2019re up about $50 billion and now represent almost 25% of our overall Basel III advanced risk weighted assets. And I think as you look at relative to our peers, it brings us, and puts us in line with where our peers are with that and we\u2019ll continue to refine it and work through that in the future. Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley : Okay. Just lastly on expenses, you did show a nice reduction in core expenses. Could speak to some of the things that have been hitting the headlines recently, cuts in global markets 5%. Is this accurate? Is it part of new BAC or is it more normal course expense management and then the branches are down 10% over the last two years. How much more optimization is there? Bruce Thompson : I am sorry Betsy; I missed the first part of your question. Brian Moynihan : On the global market, the trimming that we did, it was announced as sort of annual term that goes on. Remember we\u2019re -- always we\u2019re adding and we had frankly record hiring from schools this year coming. So we always are, sort of adjusting the headcount, keep the expenses in mind based on -- we have a lot new people join us here, as we go into the summer that we\u2019ve already made offers to and it\u2019s kind of a general betting. So I wouldn\u2019t put that as anything other than just sort of day-to-day expense management and also just a natural turn up in the business. The second part, Bruce? Bruce Thompson : Yes, on branch optimization as we look at that and I think you really get a sense for the progress within branch optimization when you flip through the consumer and business banking segment. A chunk of that relates to new BAC and you can see over the course of 12 months as we\u2019ve taken the branches down by about 300 units, that\u2019s contributed to on a year-over-year basis a $180 million of expenses that we saw during the quarter. Betsy, so, this is a long term strategy. So whether it\u2019s in the BAC or not, we\u2019ll continue to optimize the platform and what we show you back in the appendix slide is the mobile banking growth is pretty strong. So at the end of day if you look at it across the last five or six years, we have more customers, a lot more deposits and a lot less cost structure as we reposition to meet the customers\u2019 changing issues of first computers, then phones and the enhanced effectiveness of the ATM. So you should expect that -- those techniques to continue but be that as it may, we also had -- still have 7 million, 7.5 million people coming in our branches every week that are great opportunities to engage with customers that we also continue to see strong foot traffic. So we are managing this to meet those needs from both the people coming to the branch and the people who use the automated techniques and that is the challenge as we go forward. I think we\u2019ve done a pretty good job of bringing them down and keeping the expenses kind of moving with the customer flow. Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley : Great, but from here, this branch level you think holds or you still have more work to do on pulling it down? Bruce Thompson : We will adjust it every month and keep looking at it and making adjustments as they look over multiple years in the future. But if you, remember originally we said we get around 5,000 out of new BAC. That was kind of the number we gave you and move there. But also remember that what you define as a branch will change. We have these express branch formats where there is sales people plus what we call ATAs which are ATM machines that you could actually call up -- work with tellers directly. It allows you to cash checks to penny, authenticate without your -- your card is stuck in the machine, with anything to do with a regular teller. And so it\u2019s all important to us. So I think focusing on the numbers of course, the overall cost of this structure -- all the parts is -- and that\u2019s what I focus on. If you look at that we continue to drive that down taking all the cost of the whole infrastructure relative to the deposit base that\u2019s down from down there 200 basis points. Operator : And we\u2019ll go next to Glenn Schorr with ISI. Please go ahead. Glenn Schorr - ISI: Looking for a quick comment on the overall loan picture. There is always a lot of puts and takes. So the commercial side grew by 8% year over year. The consumer shrunk by 0.7%. A lot of that\u2019s run off. So can you just give a general comment on how you\u2019re feeling about loan growth and then we\u2019ve been there -- your commentary on the mortgage originations pipeline being up 23% in the first quarter. Thank you. Brian Moynihan : Sure. The first is why don\u2019t we start -- if you start with the, within the global banking segment, we saw loans relative to year end up about $2.5 billion and up more significantly on a year-over-year basis and say that we continue to see good loan demand within the commercial space. It\u2019s across both BNI as well as real estate. So we feel good about that. But as I did note, that during the quarter there were certain opportunities and things that we looked at, that we did not do in that we very much have a focus, not just on growing the loans but the return that\u2019s generated from those loans. And I think going forward you should expect to see us grow loans but we\u2019re going to be prudent and it needs to be at returns that make sense and for those customers that we have good relationships with. If you move to the consumer side, as I did note and you can see it when you look within the CSBB segment, that the majority of the loan reduction we saw in consumer was really three things. It was the pay-off of first mortgage loans that were held for investment purpose within the investment portfolio. It was the continued reduction within the home equity business where we have about $3.5 billion of home equity loans that repay each quarter but those tend to be older vintages and get back to the home equities we\u2019re doing when it finish and then the third was the overall card balances were down about $4 billion, which on a seasonal basis is what we would expect and we would look to see those card balances stabilize as we go throughout 2014. As it relates to new activity, we did note that the pipeline is up about 23%. What we saw was not materially different than others in that the first month, two months of the quarter applications and volume were down with some of the weather but we did see a pickup in that activity which led to -- obviously off of a low base, a 23% increase in the pipeline as we go into the second quarter. Bruce Thompson : The other thing I would reference is if you look back, you can see that we have been able to increase and move up what we were doing on the home equity front where we had $2 billion of originations during the quarter. And I would just note from a credit quality perspective, and what we\u2019re seeing there, those loan-to-values tend to be in the 60s with FICO scores deep into the 700. So that area is providing an opportunity for us as well. Glenn Schorr - ISI: In some -- I think, I just - I don\u2019t want to put words in your mouth, but if you look at the net of just 50 basis points for total loans, year-on-year, it sounds like it\u2019s better than that just because of the run-off, I just want to make sure that I get that specifics comment. Bruce Thompson :  Yes, especially in the consumer business, the runoff affects the overall numbers. Because remember, we still got the portfolios that we inherited from acquisitions. They are still running through it. Glenn Schorr - ISI: Follow up on the legal -- you mentioned the first two were fully reserved for. The 2.4 adds to the reserve. Where are we now in terms of the estimated losses above and beyond what you reserved for? In other words, I would think it could go down as you continue to add further reserve? Bruce Thompson : Are you referring to the range of possible losses that we disclosed when we put the Q out? Glenn Schorr - ISI: Correct. Bruce Thompson : Yes I think -- we're working through in refining that. We don\u2019t put that out with earnings. We put it out when we file the 10-Q. But to your point, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s - we obviously made progress with getting FHFA put behind us, as well as FGIC and some other related matters and we\u2019re working through where exactly that range of possible loss comes out, but hear your point. Glenn Schorr - ISI: Okay, I appreciate it. And then last one on slide, I think it\u2019s 14. Just curious, the equity investment income, what\u2019s driving that? It seems to have a nice steady and upward trending slope. Bruce Thompson : Yes. As we noted in the script, that we did complete the final monetization of an investment that was a decent chunk of that. So I would not expect to see those revenues at those levels going forward. Operator : And we\u2019ll go next to Jonathan McDonald with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead. Jonathan McDonald - Sanford Bernstein : Bruce, I was wondering if -- just want to understand the dynamic of the net interest income outlook. I guess in the second quarter, it\u2019s the increase in lower yielding liquidity on an average basis and that\u2019s going to push the NRI down a little bit. That overwhelms the day count. Is that what\u2019s happening in the second quarter? Bruce Thompson :  Yes. Keep in mind, you only pick up one day Q1 to Q2. I think you have a couple of things as I mentioned. You\u2019ve got -- relative to first quarter, you do have more card balances given the seasonal bump that you see at year-end that you carry; a fair bit of during the first quarter. We did build up throughout the first quarter, a significant amount of liquidity in anticipation of those rules. That will contribute a little bit to the decline in the second quarter and then as we saw for that you\u2019d expect to see that move up. Nothing structural. We do have some seasonal stuff in the markets business that we do, that depresses things and touch in the second quarter. So as we said it\u2019s obviously early in the quarter but we\u2019re expecting a slight decline, but then we\u2019d expect the trajectory to get back to the levels that we\u2019ve previously talked about. Jonathan McDonald - Sanford Bernstein : Okay, and what\u2019s helping it grind higher beyond the second quarter, Bruce, just as a reminder? What helps it grow in the third and fourth quarter and beyond? Bruce Thompson : Sure. I think, as you would look at it, one of the things that we continue to work through is that the debt footprint will come down, although more modestly, but what we are seeing is as we look at the levels at which we raise debt going forward, the cost of that has come down significantly. So you have some pickup there. You obviously have some pickup with some of the loan growth that we\u2019re seeing within the commercial space and we continue to take deposit pricing down as well, although we\u2019re down to levels that are harder to get much lower. And I do just want to remind you Jon, and I know you know this that as we give this guidance, it\u2019s backed up and it excludes market related impacts that come out of FAS 91. Jonathan McDonald - Sanford Bernstein : Okay, and then on litigation expense, Bruce, with the big reserve build and the settlements this quarter, what\u2019s the outlook there? I know it\u2019s tough to forecast. But should we assume that a few hundred million of litigation expense will process through the next several quarters? Bruce Thompson : I think you have to look between -- we've continued and I just reminded -- as you look at the litigation pipeline and you look at where we are; we\u2019ve obviously gotten through the base rep and warrant with respect to the GSEs. We were able to get through and reach an agreement with FGIC, which is the fourth monoline settlement that we have. And then we are working through in the Article 77 case that is going through the judicial process. So as we continue to reduce the number of outstanding litigation items that we have, that should obviously bode well for what I would characterize as the kind of base litigation expense. That being said, I think we need to be realistic and you saw it this quarter that as it relates to the remaining couple of matters that we disclosed, it can be lumpy in that it\u2019s just very hard to predict. But as we talked about it in the presentation, during the quarter we did have a pretty significant build as we continue to evaluate those positions, as well as the discussions that we have, that our parties do the litigation. Brian Moynihan : Jon I think the simple way. If you think about things that -- litigation matters that sort of arise after \u201808, \u201909, the cost of those are very modest, anything new exist. These all cost really relates to the stuff before the price [indiscernible] cleanup. So your point about what would be ongoing litigation, trust me, much, much lower but the question is the lumpiness refers to the transition we got left on a few of these matters. Jonathan McDonald - Sanford Bernstein : Okay, and then Bruce just to clarify the provision commentary that you made. Your outlook is for net charge offs to kind of grind lower modestly but -- and reserve release to continue but probably at a smaller level than the 380 we saw this quarter? Bruce Thompson :  Yes, I think that\u2019s fair Jon. It can bounce around in any one quarter but the provision number, broadly speaking is in line with what we\u2019d expect over the next couple of quarters. Brian Moynihan : So Jon, another way is if you look at the supplemental material and the pages on the charge offs by product. You got to remember that there is - if you look at the credit card charge offs in U.S. and domestic, they\u2019re down. This quarter was 700 million and 3.25% charge off rate. You are kind of hitting a place where the business is geared to have some amount of charge offs and it\u2019s the way the business works, part of the cost of doing business as a credit cost. If you look outside that number, that is -- card charge offs are like 80% of the charge offs, 60% 70% of charge offs, and they are going to be hard to get down a lot more. So there is work to do on mortgage charge offs, home equity charge offs. If you look across the rest of the board, they\u2019re in pretty good shape. Jonathan McDonald - Sanford Bernstein : And last thing from me; just wondering if trading and fixed income in particular, do they have any notable sequential trends in the quarter? Did trading get better in March and early April as rate volatility started to pick up a little bit or anything like that? Brian Moynihan : I wouldn\u2019t highlight any real seasonality of note as it relates to drastic ups or downs throughout the quarter. The one piece that I would say that I think generally rates in foreign exchange, given where the market was in the back that there was not a lot of volatility in the quarter was clearly negatively affected. And on the positive side I would say that the overall credit trading businesses, whether it be loans, high grade bond trading or high yield bond trading, given market activity levels as well as our position from an underwriting perspective, were very strong during the quarter. Operator : And we\u2019ll go next to Paul Miller with FBR. Please go ahead. Thomas LeTrent - FBR:  This is Thomas LeTrent on behalf of Paul. Another sort of expense theme question; there has obviously been an increased amount of regulatory scrutiny on MSR transfers. Can you touch for me a little bit, whether, if those transactions got delayed or pushed out, if it would impact your ability to meet expense targets or just a little color there? Brian Moynihan : A very good question. What I would point out is, and if you go back to the fourth quarter of 2012, that was when we announced our significant MSR transfers. And so if you look at where we are, as it relates to just pure MSR transfers or through the significant majority of what we would expect, we\u2019ve got some clean up and far smaller ones during the second quarter, third quarter and fourth quarters. We don\u2019t have any reason to believe, given they\u2019re small and who they\u2019re going to, that there\u2019ll be a problem with the transfer. So we feel, and as it relates to getting to the expense targets with what\u2019s left to go, that will not be an issue for us. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Ken Usdin - Jefferies:  I wanted to ask you about just operating leverage and again expense progress. So year-over-year revenues plus or minus were down $1 billion and if I\u2019m looking at Slide 7, I\u2019m looking at -- the core expenses were down a few hundred million and that\u2019s net of all the New BAC benefits. So can you talk to us about just the push and pull between the net BFA -- the New BFA, New BAC reductions and then what cost inflation you\u2019re seeing any underneath the core. And then as you look forward, just how we should expect that core line to traject, the \u201813 excluding the retirement eligible? Brian Moynihan : Sure let me answer the last of your question first, which is we would expect the core trajectory to trend down as we go throughout 2014. When you look at the, and if you\u2019re looking on Slide 7 and we compare the $13.8 billion to the $13.6 billion, let me just consider and give you a couple of numbers that affected that core. During the first quarter of \u201914, as we continue to reduce headcount, we incurred over a $100 million of severance expense on both an absolute basis as well as a year-over-year basis within those numbers. So you had a $100 million to the negative there. The second thing is and as we disclosed, we have been investing within corporate banking, cash management sales people, to a lesser extent capital markets people and some of the technology that goes along with that and we think as we look going forward, we\u2019re through a lot of that investment but as I referenced in my comments, I would ask you to flip back up to page 26 because we are seeing the benefit from revenue growth from those investments and we\u2019d obviously expect those to moderate going forward. The other couple of things that I would note there is if you look at within the wealth management business, you need to consider within that area that we did have $200 million plus increase in revenue from asset management fees. So there\u2019s obviously compensation that goes out with that as well as some of the technology dollars that were spent for our Merrill 1 project that we rolled out within the wealth management area. So I would just say, as you look at that 200, the benefit from New BAC was clearly on a year-over-year, much more significant from that. But we are investing in the areas where we think and where we\u2019re seeing revenue growth and we would obviously expect those investments, given that they\u2019ve been made and are generating the revenues that you\u2019d expect those to moderate going forward. Ken Usdin - Jefferies:  And just a follow-up to that then, we are going to continue to see improvements to get to that 2 billion New BAC level by mid-next year. But given what you anticipate on the revenue side, do you feel that that\u2019s enough to get you where you want to go in terms of profitability improvement or is there anything you can contemplate or need to contemplate as far as finding other incremental ways to fund those investments or drive more to the bottom line? Brian Moynihan :  Obviously we continue to look at that and we continue, we started after this, as you know in \u201811 and so if you go back, I think we had $80 odd billion expenses when we started this thing and so we\u2019ve been driving it down year after year after year. But that doesn\u2019t mean it stops at New BAC. It\u2019s just the challenge inherent in the slow growth environment is how to manage the relative investment rate, expense growth rate versus revenue growth rate. And so that\u2019s something we as management continue to focus on. But if you think about the $13.6 billion and think about continue make some improvement against it, sort of annualize that add back, whatever $1 billion to the one time retirement cost and then some litigation, you start to get into levels that we think are consistent with the earnings, sort of restoring the normalized earnings pool. The question is, and you are right is that we got to make sure that the investments we make are yielding the revenue benefits and we got to keep the total expenses overall and that\u2019s we are up to. And I think the way to think about that is, look at 3,500 more employees\u2019 headcount reduction this quarter and you\u2019ll continue to see that work its way down. That is a leading indicator of what\u2019s going to happen next quarter because those employees, that the spot-to-spot number went out during the quarter but they\u2019re still on the payroll for the quarter. Ken Usdin - Jefferies:  Got it. And one last one, just card income and service charges -- a lot of other banks have been seeing weakness there, partially weather, partially regulatory, partial pricing changes. Anything that you guys are seeing or anticipate seeing on any of those fronts looking ahead? Bruce Thompson :  If you think about the longer term trend there, we had a big change in terms of fee structures in the consumer business, broadly going back a few years ago and you kind of came through all that and that affected. What\u2019s happened now as if you just look at our card activity, our purchases on our cards are up by 5% or so quarter to last year this quarter -- first quarter last year to first quarter this year. So, we continue to see better than market growth in the activity levels -- general spending levels and things like that -- which helps them interchange that once we got off, sort of the reduction that were due to the change in interchange rules, and so I think they\u2019ll keep driving forward based on just general activity but most of the real down draft came out in \u201811, \u201812, early \u201813 timeframe. Brian Moynihan :  Yes, I think the other point is, if you look at within the consumer business, we actually saw the service charges during the quarter were up about 3% on a year-over-year basis. So some of the card income tends to be seasonally higher in the fourth quarter. It dropped in the first quarter then builds back up but within the consumer space we were pleased with what we saw on the service charge line during the quarter. Bruce Thompson :  So, if you go back and look at 17, we got, we have been producing from a sort of 700,000 to 800,000 run rate new cards to a 1 million plus and those cards are being used as a core card by the customers, in such driving up -- the pay rate is still high. So the balances aren\u2019t moving much but the activity underneath is moving and we\u2019re still replacing some affinity portfolios that we sold and things like that. So our view is that the transactional behavior of our customers continues to grow and will benefit some of the fee lines too. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead. Mike Mayo - CLSA: First, just a couple of follow ups. So how much of the new BAC savings were achieved by the end of the quarter? Bruce Thompson : You should look at relative to the $2 billion a quarter. We\u2019re in the $1.7 billion area. Mike Mayo - CLSA: All right, so you have $300 million left per quarter to be achieved by mid-2015? Bruce Thompson : That\u2019s correct. Mike Mayo - CLSA: Okay. And then the LAS savings, you have another $500 million a quarter to be achieved by the end of the year? Bruce Thompson : That\u2019s correct. Mike Mayo - CLSA: All right. So, $800 million total quarterly expense savings we should expect over the next year or so. So, should we expect all that to hit the bottom line? Bruce Thompson : You should expect it to hit the bottom line with just the one caveat, that to the extent that there are revenue related things that have cost attached to them that could moderate that reduction but ultimately that would be a positive to the pre-tax income line. Mike Mayo - CLSA: Okay. And do you have an efficiency target for the firm? Because I\u2019m just looking at Page 3 of the supplement and the efficiency ratio is kind of thrown off by the charges and it\u2019s been in the 70s the last few quarters and 97.68%, I don\u2019t think you consider that your core efficiency ratio. So what do you consider your core efficiency ratio and where should it be and where you hope to get -- when do you hope to get there? Bruce Thompson : I think if you go back and look at what we talked about in the fourth quarter, where we talked about where we\u2019d like to get to from an ROA return on tangible common equity and we talked about once rate started to move up that and as we looked out, we look out in a couple of years, that efficiency ratio should be in the high 50s. Mike Mayo - CLSA: Okay. So do you have a specific time frame for that or just when rates go up? Bruce Thompson : I think as we look at it, it\u2019s just at a point in time that rates are up roughly 100 basis points across the curve and obviously to the extent that we don\u2019t see rates move up, we\u2019re going to need to run harder on expenses to try to get it to the extent that the rate environment doesn\u2019t move up. Mike Mayo - CLSA: Shifting gears, the tax rate excluding the mortgage charge to the first quarter was what? Bruce Thompson : I believe it was roughly I guess about 50% -- somewhere between 58% and 60%. Mike Mayo - CLSA: I\u2019m sorry the tax rate? You said the tax rate going ahead will be 31%. Bruce Thompson : Right. Mike Mayo - CLSA: I\u2019m just trying to figure out, what was the core tax rate for this quarter, excluding the charge? Bruce Thompson : It would be -- I mean the core tax rate we project out and look out over the years. Still the core would have been 31, but you always have a little bit of noise when you -- and obviously it was a pretax loss but the discrete item always kind of overwhelms things a low period. But the base rate from which you\u2019re starting from is 31% and it was just a little bit skewed given what we saw from a pretax loss perspective. Mike Mayo - CLSA: Okay. You had record wealth management for the quarter, and one of the online brokers recently said that the big brokerage firms are doing better. How much do you attribute the record wealth management to the environment versus what you\u2019re doing versus it\u2019s better to be a big broker? Brian Moynihan : I\u2019m not sure what the context is Mike but the net flows in the wealth management business were around $11 billion -- $12 billion this quarter which was nearly 17 to 18 due to long term flows and $6 billion of short term liquidity flows out for net of around $12 billion. If you look in the Merrill Edge platform, which is more akin to the sort of the online type of thing, I think we had 80,000 plus to account this quarter. We asked continue to grow and top to 100 billion daily average trades are up I think 25% to 30% year-over-year. And so it continues to progress and we continue to see good asset flows there too. So big, small, large, traditional, all that sort of blended together, we operate as a core consolidated franchise you\u2019re seeing good momentum in both. Mike Mayo - CLSA: You\u2019re allocating more capital at GWIM as well as global banking and global markets. Is that increased capital allocation due to regulatory capital changes or a deliberate move by you guys to invest more for growth in those segments? Brian Moynihan : Well, let me just start -- the allocation of capital is how we think the capital that we have the Company and push it out to the businesses - I think you need to go segment by segment within that Mike. I think the first is that as you look at the global banking segment and look at the allocation and what we\u2019ve done, the first is on a year-over-year basis you had average loans up about $30 billion. So there were more loan balances against which you need to allocate capital. The second thing that I would say is as you look at that segment and you consider Basel III standardized ratios, they tend to risk weight almost all commercial loans at 100% regardless of what the models would suggest they should be risk weighted at. So I think the combination of the loan growth, along with some of the impacts from regulatory capital led us to increase what we did with respect to global banking. Within global wealth management, as you go back and refine operational loss models and assign operational risk capital, that was topped up as well as reflecting the fact within wealth management business that we\u2019ve seen loan growth within that segment. So there was additional money allocated there and then as we look at and just continue to refine and look at both comparables as well as asset mix, we thought it was prudent to increase modestly what we saw with a global market and as I said in my comments, when you consider the aggregate and we look at where we are relative to peers, we\u2019ve got virtually all of our capital at this point pushed out to the different businesses which is the way it should be. Mike Mayo - CLSA:  I agree. So it sounds like it\u2019s partly business growth and partly regulatory related and partly a desire simply to have less unallocated capital. Bruce Thompson :  I think the last one is what you got to keep up. Mike Mayo - CLSA:  Okay and then lastly, the Bank of New York ruling was good. I did not expect that, but you still had a $6 billion charge this quarter and another $2.4 billion extra charge in the last 15 workdays since the FHFA amount was announced and I know you\u2019ve had several questions in the call but what\u2019s left as far as potential legal charges, because the teams are so lumpy and if in just a few weeks you can have another $2.4 billion charge seemingly out of the blue for some of us, what\u2019s left? Bruce Thompson :  I think when you look at it, as I commented that I think we give fairly wholesome disclosure in the 10-K as it relates to the matters that are out there and when you look at the matters and compare where we are now to what\u2019s out there, that obviously from the case that FHFA was resolved and that was the $3.6 billion number we mentioned. You\u2019ve seen resolutions during the quarter from an Allstate RMBS perspective. You saw a resolution of force-placed lace insurance. You saw CFPB/OCC, and you saw the deal that we completed and announced with FGIC today. So as you work through and look at those matters it\u2019s largely with what\u2019s disclosed leaves you with respect to one monoline and then in addition to the monoline, the other remaining legacy mortgage related matters that we put out in our disclosure. Operator :  We\u2019ll go next to Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead. Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research :  Let me just start out by saying on the litigation front, I actually thought it was very good that you\u2019ve provided now for a bunch of the issues that are actually still pretty visible out there. So let\u2019s just a thank you for having done that. I have a question for you on the control environment cost. Some of your competitors, JPMorgan and Citi have spoken to you know billion dollar type numbers for increased control environment cost in the wake of CCAR issues over the last few years and obviously all of the -- the heightened scrutiny and I was wondering if you could give us a sense for what your control cost increase has been over the last year or two. Bruce Thompson :  I\u2019ll give you a number, let me give you a way to think about it. In our environment, coming out of the same issues in \u201908 and \u201909, we built a lot of personnel and headcount to get after the stuff and we\u2019re still finishing up to clean up and so if you look in the expense base, a lot of that\u2019s been in the expense base for a couple of years and then and so if you think about something like our audit team, we doubled the size of our audit team probably in 2010 and it\u2019s been held fairly constant against that. Against the back drop, we probably divested tons of businesses and the rest of the headcount the Company has come down you know fairly dramatically from a high of 305,000 I think. So the amount of control environment relative to the total cost structure has gone up but the raw numbers haven\u2019t gone up as dramatically because frankly we put a lot of men in \u201910 - \u201811 timeframe. So it is our duty to get it right. It\u2019s our duty to keep working on it and make sure that we get these things right to the ground but one of the key ways that we\u2019re doing this is by focusing the scope of the Company. So the fourth place, excuse me, the add on products build up this quarter, we quit offering those products a while ago. It just took a while with the OCC and the consumer bureau to finish up the negotiations and finish up the rebate. We\u2019ve been sending money back to customers, but we quit offering the products as an example and so the idea of narrowing the products, that\u2019s narrowing the geographic scope of the Company, making the Company a lot less complex. We\u2019ll always be big but we make ourselves less complex, but against that a growing -- a strong growth in the control cost in the \u20189-\u201810-\u201811 timeframe and in the flattening of that, but relative to smaller companies is actually an increase. Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research :  Thanks. That\u2019s helpful color, certainly in terms of thinking about the timing. You did allude to some increase in technology investment in GWIM and obviously the margin there contracted a little bit. Maybe you can give us a little bit of a sense for what this - I think you alluded to Merrill One? Brian Moynihan :  Well, Merrill One is a new product they brought out that\u2019s been successful and like anything else, you put the product after you\u2019ve spent all the money to put the product together and the assets come on it. And so we are feeling good about that, tens of billions of dollars of that\u2019s been moved to the platform. It is a good platform for customers and for the advisors. I think more broadly I talked about technology. If you looked at the expenses we had going back, sort of at the prices, we saw the Merrill transition expenses and all in we\u2019re spending around $3 billion in technology development a year. We now spend about 3.5 billion. And then obviously the transition expenses are out there. So everything we\u2019re spending is to better the platform, better the business, invest in the growth. And again some of your questions about cost, that number, I don\u2019t expect to change going forward because it takes that kind of technology investment to drive the product capabilities of our company; Merrill One being one product this quarter along with a new card system, a new trading platform. Tom and his team are in the middle of putting in a new backbone for the Company in terms of our general accounting systems, which has been the tailwind going in and across the board. So across a four five year format, the timeframe will replace almost every system in the Company, but we would expect that to continue. So the GWIN, we swung around, last we did more in other businesses cash management, we started building -- rebuilt the front end mortgage process and a lot of other things. This year we swung the GWIN and it\u2019s really a decision of which business we invest in at which time and they ask more investment this year. Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research : And then final one for me. You gave the leverage ratios being above the 5% and the 6% requirements based on the most recent NPR. Subsequent to that -- I guess Basel came out in March with some suggested changes to the netting on a standardized basis for counter party credit and I was wondering if you have any sense at this point, what the impact on the leverage ratio would be of those changes if implemented. Brian Moynihan : I think the final supplementary leverage ratio rules that reflected that came out in April and so the numbers that we\u2019ve given you where we\u2019re above the 5% were 6% at the bank, reflects the impact of those rules with respect to netting and the other changes. The numbers we have given you reflect that April release. Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research : That\u2019s from the Fed right, the April release from the Fed? Brian Moynihan : That\u2019s correct. Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research : No. What I was referring to is that Basel had come out with something in March, which one would assume that eventually the Fed will adopt for the standardized approach to counter party credit, and I think JPM alluded on Slide 8 to the idea that could add depending on whether you look at the whole Company, whether the holding company or the bank units upwards of 20 basis points to the leverage ratio because it takes into account the net integrated expense. I was wondering if you had done any preliminary work on that. Brian Moynihan : I think, I we\u2019ll say that our focus has been on wrapping up the work, given what the April pronouncement is. I\u2019m not -- my understanding was that the Fed, I think what came out in April is what we\u2019re assuming that we\u2019re going to need to operate in and there is something else that changes whether the benefit that\u2019s great. But our assumption is we\u2019re going to be living on what came out on April 8th. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank :  If I could just follow up on the net interest income comment, I guess just bigger picture. It seems like the outlook is a little bit lower than what you had previously thought? And I just want to think about building liquidity tends to be dilutive to NIM but not net interest income dollars. Some of the things you point to are seasonal. So just like big picture, as we think about where you had thought NII [ph] might be a couple of quarters ago looking out -- what\u2019s worse? Is it more run off than you thought? Less loan growth because you\u2019re tightening up versus what some others are doing or is it just the rates haven\u2019t moved at all or some combination of all that? Brian Moynihan : I\u2019d make a couple of points. If you go back -- the guidance that we\u2019ve given is that we\u2019ve lined up from roughly $10.5 billion number and as we look out to third quarter and fourth quarter, that\u2019s what we see in our numbers. I do think there have been, relative to -- if you go back two, three, four quarters ago, several things that have changed. The first is that as we\u2019ve worked hard to get in the position that we\u2019re in from an LCR perspective, we have -- LCR but with the rate environment that we\u2019re managing the OCI risk that we have directed more of the investment portfolio to shorter daily treasuries, is mortgage backed securities and as you go out over a couple of quarters, that has a negative impact. The second thing, as you look at where we are and you look at the forward curve, our assumptions on what yields are going to be that we can reinvest in outside of the switch and mix, obviously those yields have not moved to the extent that the forward curves would have suggested at that point. And I would say generally with respect to the loan portfolio, I wouldn\u2019t say there is much change. I do think that the one thing to note that we\u2019ve not talked about, if you look at within our global banking segment, this is the first quarter in a while where we\u2019ve actually see the loan pricing spread stabilize and actually in certain of the portfolios move up at touch. So that\u2019s a positive. So I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything to your question -- that material that there are just some small things here and there and we wanted to update and share our thoughts with what we thought the second quarter would be but longer term I think we\u2019re still in the same place as far as the 10.5 [ph] grinding up. Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank : Okay. And then just switching topics on the core LAS cost. So ex all the litigation, you iterated the target for year-end, I think of about a $1 billion or $1.1 billion. Still feel good about the $500 million per quarter late next year? Brian Moynihan : Yes. Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank : And is that something that we could see overshoots the downside like we\u2019re seeing in charge-offs. Obviously like credit is getting much better than a lot of us would have thought a couple of years ago. Do you think those core LAS cost end up just being much lower than expected once you work through all the issues? Brian Moynihan : I just said, I hope so, but I wouldn\u2019t. Let\u2019s just get it down to that level and we\u2019ll figure out what we can do from there. I mean its arduous task and there\u2019s still lot of work at it. Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank : Okay. And then just lastly on SLR again, just care to provide any more details in terms of how much above 5%, how much above 6% roughly. Brian Moynihan : So I would say that, we\u2019ve said we\u2019re above 5%. We\u2019ve said that. Assuming that Buffett preferred amendment gets done, that adds up to another 10 basis points, which obviously move this up. And you can assume that the only other guidance that says that -- the bank ratio relative to the limit is stronger than where we are with the parent today but once again, the Buffett amendment will help. Operator : We will go next to Marty Mosby with Guggenheim. Please go ahead. Marty Mosby - Guggenheim: Thank you. Three questions. One is operational risk you talked about, and that represents about 25% of your risk weighted asset. So in doing that and in the past, that is very sticky and how do you think you can manage around the amount of capital just been trapped with the fact of all these past settlements that you had to kind of live through? Brian Moynihan : Yes. Your point Marty is a good one, which is the operational risk model are based on a fairly long time series as we look at it. And one of the things that we do, continue to try to discuss this stress is that, a lot of those operational risk losses are with respect to activity that we no longer engage and have no intention to engage. So there are some of that dialog that continue but your point which is a fair one is that the time series are fairly long and it will remain out there and till the data runs out and I wish there was more that I can say but your point is a fair one. Marty Mosby - Guggenheim: Is the only true way, is it almost disembarked from mortgage because there were so much in that particular area. The only way to clean it up is to say maybe if that\u2019s all related to those mortgage settlement -- mortgage related settlement, it\u2019s just not worth carrying that baggage going forward, even though it wasn\u2019t really your fault. It was the country wide legacy more than it was your own operations. Brian Moynihan : I think your point Marty is the one that we\u2019re working through, and in fact we\u2019ve done like you suggested that we\u2019ve done and this is if you look at those activities that led to those losses, we are no longer engaged in those activities. If you look out at -- we are not doing business with monolines from a new rep perspective. You look at private label securitization. That activity with rep and warrant is not continuing. So we think we\u2019ve largely done that and I think the question just going forward is, if you\u2019ve proven and you clearly are outside of the activity, is there any release to be had, not the way that it worked now, we\u2019ll just have to work through and deal with it. Marty Mosby - Guggenheim: Got you. Secondly, you called out that mortgage servicing hedging was unfavorable this quarter. If you kind of look at the environment, it seemed like I\u2019ve seen in others that it was actually a positive, not a negative. What was in particular happening in your mortgage servicing hedging? Brian Moynihan : There was really nothing. I think the comment that we made was that the question of the hedging performance this quarter relative to a year ago. So the hedging was still a positive number. It was just less so on a year-over-year basis. Marty Mosby - Guggenheim: Got you. And then lastly, when you think about moving from your mortgage backed securities into agencies and treasuries that have shorter durations, that\u2019s kind of throwing you to become more assets sensitive. Are you thinking about -- because liquidity rules are making the balance sheet become more asset sensitive, employing more interest rates swaps or off balance sheet hedging to rebalance and not become so much more effort sensitive vis-\u00e0-vis other pressures. Brian Moynihan : If you go back, we have been pretty consistent at the -- the reason for the investment portfolio is to preserve the long-term value of the deposit and as you look at that portfolio, it\u2019s very clear there are only three things that we do within that portfolio. There is treasury security, there\u2019s agency security and there is AA and AAA super-sovereign type activities. And as it relates to becoming a little bit more asset sensitive, we just think, given the first and you\u2019ve seen a large portion of it happen that -- just to drive and get to the point we have with LCR, the shift in the portfolio helped this quarter. It has the same benefit as I said of shrinking and reducing your OCI risk as you go through this and we\u2019re not interested in starting to try to do things from a derivative and other perspective that somehow changed that. The investment portfolio needs the work with how we set it up and we\u2019re going to be prudent with respect to how we do it. Operator :  And we will go next with Nancy Bush with NAB Research LLC. Please go ahead. Nancy Bush - NAB Research LLC :  Question on the mortgage business. I think there was an article on The Wall Street Journal this morning or somewhere that the business is getting off to a slower start than we would have thought, given the spring bounce back that was expected from the winter weather. Has there been any rethinking Brian on sort of the eventual size and direction of the mortgage business there? Brian Moynihan :  Nancy we kind of did that in 2011. We got out of all but direct-to-consumer. So basically we have focused a business on really supporting the core customer base and not trying to drive standalone market shares in the scheme of things. And so what has happened to that is that as we sold off the non-core servicing, we\u2019ve gotten down to a significant less number of loans serviced and the originations, $10 billion just quarter, all direct-to-consumer which is a second highest total in the country, direct-to-consumer mortgages. So, I think we are comfortable where we are. Now the question is with the LAS aside, the core business, what does it look like and it will be a small business, smaller business, it will generate customer, mortgages for our customers because it\u2019s the core product they need but also that sales force quite frankly sells other products and does other things for us, refers people for other products. So, I think that the days of being a 20% market share and suffer far behind is the days of being 4% market share direct-to-consumer and growing there. And we will make some money in it and we will make some money servicing those four loans to delinquencies, just those six and those on what we have been doing and that are far superior to even what we would have predicted and that\u2019s how we run the business. So effectively we\u2019ve done what you said. It\u2019s just we\u2019re still sort of down by the overhang of effectively -- the LAS portfolio is still working through the system and 300,000 delinquent mortgages of which only about -- the delinquency of the core portfolio is about 50,000, 60,000. Nancy Bush - NAB Research LLC :  Also could you make sort of a similar pronouncement about the card business? Where you stand in terms of chair and growth right now and are you where you want to be? Brian Moynihan :  That\u2019s different in a sense that on the card side, we actually took it down unfortunately through charge-offs and might [ph] have been more than not but I think we have been relatively consistent on a domestic piece around $90 odd billion of outstanding and kind of grinding up and down from there and producing more cards that are coming out of the wall first from our customer from 700,000 we showed you two years ago first quarter to million plus this quarter and pretty consistently with a 1 million plus the third quarter of almost a 1 million in the fourth quarter, another 1 million plus this quarter. But the total we see there is actually usage of those cards. They sold 60% plus to our primary customers but also the usage of the card because of the core three or four card product is driving it and we have some affiliate programs. I think the card business is likewise. It is where we want it but it\u2019s a bit more of a payment stream business than it is a pure lending business as it was in the some of the past. So the balances ought to be stable and ought to grow but with the high quality portfolio the payments rates in the 20s now -- I mean people pay us off because they are using the transaction card. Nancy Bush - NAB Research LLC :  And just finally, Bruce you have indicated that net interest income is going to decline somewhat due to liquidity issues et cetera. Is that same going to be true of the NIM or is there anything in the mix change coming in the near term that can send the NIM up from -- the adjusted NIM up from this 236 level? Bruce Thompson :  I think we said that we thought that the core NII ex-market related impact to be down slightly in the second quarter and then grow modestly through the rest of the year. What you will see in the second quarter given that you have the full quarter -- the liquidity that\u2019s on the book, you would expect to see that the NIM in the second quarter moderate a little bit, given that you\u2019ve got the full quarter of the liquidity and then obviously as it starts to grow during the latter half of the year, you\u2019d expect the NIM to follow that. Brian Moynihan :  And that\u2019s the overall, now that we have better insight as to what these rules are, we don\u2019t have to go back and go get 7% common equity ratio, so we have very strong common equity ratio. We have to go back and sort of look at, Bruce and I think, with the rules now in hand, you can start to go work and say okay, how do we optimize the next round because in terms of how we create maximum liquidity per dollar balance sheet of that size, right? Operator : And we will take our last question from Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research; please go ahead. Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research :  Two quick. Just first on home equity net charge-off, I guess if you exclude the TDR impact last quarter, they were up. And so we\u2019re home equity NPLs. You just sort of walk through what\u2019s going on there. Bruce Thompson :  Sure. There were two things that Jim banged us up -- good question -- to the tune of about $50 million each. And there were some home-equity stuff that we just rolled up, that was going to have foreclosure cost, that were greater than what it was going to be worth to try to get repaid. So that happened during the quarter. And then the second thing is there was some regulatory guidance that was given as it related to second lien loans that will be high and first lien that have been modified or charged-off, that we saw during the quarter. We think we got most of it in this quarter. There maybe a little bit left in the second quarter. But it\u2019s a good question; that those two items, banged us up to the tune of about $100 million and that was the reason for the change. Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research : Okay, that\u2019s helpful and then, just on the investment banking pipeline, any commentary? Bruce Thompson : I think what we see is, the overall markets continue to be strong. The pipeline and the amount of activity in discussions from an M&A perspective is encouraging. And I would say as we go forward that -- we talked about, we felt the pipeline was strong at the end of the year, and as we look at the pipeline, it did not change materially, one way or the other at the end of the first quarter versus the end of the year. And as we said, we feel very good about the quarter with revenue side being north of a $1.5 billion and the highest than any firm that has reported at this point. Brian Moynihan : Thank you very much everyone for joining and we\u2019ll talk to you next quarter. Operator : This does conclude today\u2019s conference. You may now disconnect.

(Operator instructions) It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Mr. Lee McEntire. Please go ahead sir. Lee McEntire :  Good morning, thanks everybody on the phone as well as the webcast for joining us this morning for our second quarter results. Before I turn the call over to Brian and Bruce, let me just remind you we may make some forward-looking statements today. For further information on those, please refer to either our earnings release documents, our website or the other SEC filings. So with that I\u2019ll turn it over to Brian Moynihan our CEO for some opening comments before he goes to Bruce. Brian Moynihan :  Thanks, Lee, and good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us. As you look at our results, you can see the storyline for this quarter is much the same as it was for last quarter. You can see that the revenue is showing stability in most of the core businesses. You can see the good core expense control, continued credit improvements, and solid business activity throughout the franchise. You can also see obviously the litigation expense from our legacy mortgage issues continued to affect our earnings this quarter. And you can also see we\u2019ve continued to build our strong balance sheet position and capital and liquidity. So in a minute, Bruce will take you through the details of the results. But I thought it would be good if we spend a couple of minutes at the outset here talking about what our customer and client data is telling us about the economy and what we see in our franchise. As we all know the economy is off to a little bit of a slow start this year, but growth has picked up recently. Most recent jobs data shows nearly 1.4 million are created in the first half of this year. As we have strong positions, leadership positions across consumer and commercial companies in the Americas, we have a view into the key indicators of an improving economy which shows signs everywhere of improvement. Even in advance with the short-term interest rate is changing which would help our rich consumer \u2013 our deposit rich consumer and business banking segments, our consumer business had another good quarter. It performed well growing earnings 29% from last year included solid origination activities across the various products. In addition, as we look at our underlying consumers, they have increased their spending. We can see in our data that the retail volumes on debit and credit cards were up 4% from last year\u2019s second quarter but more importantly up 8% from the first quarter of this year showing increased momentum in spending among our card customers. Consumers are growing card balances also, they\u2019re borrowing a little bit more and they continue to add to their deposit balances. As you know, home sales continue to improve across the industry and we can see on our own results, as our originations and mortgages increased from first to second quarter, but importantly our purchase mortgage origination continue to grow. Our home equity originations also were up almost 30% for the quarter. When you look at the underlying transactional activity and volume activity in our stores, 7 to 8 million visitors come in each week showing continuous strong activity. We can also see that in our online activity where 30 million online customers continue to grow their overall volumes and importantly in our mobile activity where 15.5 million mobile customers continue to increase the use of technology including depositing 10% of all the checks, retail checks in our company through their mobile phones and other devices. The health of the consumer is also evident in our asset quality. Delinquencies continue to improve. Our consumer card loss rate ended the quarter at less than 3%. We see on the wealth management side, the consumer, the market\u2019s growth has added to consumer wealth. We have nearly $2.5 trillion in client balances in our global wealth and investment management business including a $100 billion in the brokerage assets for their retail and preferred customer base in our consumer business. We also see encouraging signs throughout our commercial customers. Commercial construction has improved and manufacturing activity in our clients has accelerated. The borrowing by our commercial customers remains healthy across the industry and credit quality is very strong. Encouraging is that middle-market utilization rates are moving forward again this quarter ever so slightly. Industry sales and trading activity among our trading counterparties has been low as many of our peers have talked about in this low volatility environment. However, our business \u2013 underlying business performed well. Tom Montag and his team had - our global markets business posted $1 billion - $1.1 billion in earnings for the quarter. Our investment banking pipeline remains strong and the back half of 2014 looks healthy. While the economy still faces challenges, progress is being made throughout the economy but also throughout our company. We are seeing good business activity and a strengthening as we go through 2014. We are seeing improved financial health for our consumers, our customers and our corporate customers. But the most important thing to think about is the signs of a gradually improving economy, is how our businesses is continually positioned to take advantage of the activity and deliver for you our shareholders. With that I\u2019ll turn it over to Bruce. Bruce Thompson :  Great, thanks, Brian, and good morning everyone. Let\u2019s start on slide 2 and work through the second quarter results. We recorded earnings of $2.3 billion or $0.19 per diluted share this quarter which included pretax litigation expense of $4 billion which equated to roughly $0.22 a share after-tax. $3.8 billion of the litigation expense is associated with the build in reserves for previously disclosed legacy mortgage related matters which also included the AIG settlement that we announced this morning. We are very pleased to have reached the definitive agreement with AIG which resolves all outstanding RMBS litigations between the parties for a settlement amount of $650 million. This agreement is important for two primary reasons. First, we have now resolved 95% of the unpaid balance of all RMBS as to which securities litigation has either been filed or threatened for all Bank of America related entities. It also includes AIG\u2019s agreement to withdraw as an objector to the Bank of New York Mellon private label securities settlement referred to as the Article 77 proceeding. Revenues this quarter, on an FTE basis were $22 billion, relative to the second quarter of 2013 revenue was down $990 million driven by lower net interest income and mortgage banking income. Relative to the first quarter of 2014, it was approximately $800 million lower as higher investment banking fees, higher mortgage banking revenue was more than offset by seasonally lower sales and trading revenue, as well as lower equity investment income. Total non-interest expense for the quarter was $18.5 billion, but included $4 billion of litigation expense. If we back out that litigation expense and compare it to Q2 2013\u2019s expenses, expenses improved by $1 billion or 6%, which was driven by lower LAS non-litigation expenses and to a lesser extent, our new BAC savings. If we back out the $1 billion of retirement-eligible incentive comp from our first quarter results as well, you can see expenses declined roughly $700 million from the first quarter as a result of lower revenue-related compensation within our global markets business, lower LAS expenses ex litigation and to a lesser degree, our new BAC savings. Provision for credit losses was $411 million with net charge-offs of $1.1 billion and a reserve release of $662 million during the quarter. Our results from the quarter also benefited from the sale of $2.1 billion in non-performing residential loans. The income statement benefit from that sale was approximately $350 million of pre-tax or $0.02 a share after-tax and you saw roughly a $150 million of that benefit flows through other income and the balance through the recovery of net charge-offs. And lastly, the aggregate amount of a few other items including debt securities gains, equity investment income, net DVA, as well as FAS 91 resulted in a benefit to EPS of approximately $0.04 a share. If we move to Slide 3 and look at our balance sheet highlights, you can see the balance sheet increased $21 billion from the first quarter of 2014. Our debt securities increased as a result of valuations and increases to highly liquid securities in our primary banking subsidiaries. Our Repo match book increased as well. If we look at ending loans, they were down $4.3 billion, primarily due to lower residential mortgages, principally within our discretionary portfolios and that also included the $2.1 billion bulk sale that I just mentioned. If we exclude residential mortgage loans, our consumer loans rose slightly as our US card balances grew $1.3 billion and our securities-based lending with our wealth management clients increased $1.8 billion. This was partially offset by pay-downs within our home equity book. If we move to the commercial side, commercial loans were up modestly as C&I growth was mostly offset by a few sizable loan pay-downs, as well as a focus on overall relationship returns. Period end deposits were over $1.1 trillion and reached record levels. Our tangible common equity ratio improved 14 basis points from the first quarter of 2014 to 7.14%. Tangible book value per share was $14.24, a 3% improvement from the first quarter and it was driven by both our earnings during the quarter, as well as a $2.3 billion increase in the value of our debt securities which you saw flow through OCI. Lastly, to further enhance our Tier-1 capital structure, during the second quarter, we received shareholder approval and amended the Series T preferred shares, which increased our Tier-1 capital by $2.9 billion, and we issued $1.5 billion in preferred stock during the quarter at a favorable rate. On Slide 4, we show our capital ratios under Basel 3. Under the transition rules, our CET1 capital was $153.6 billion, risk weighted assets $1.28 trillion, and that resulted in a ratio of 12%. If we look at our Basel 3 regulatory capital ratios on a fully phased-in basis, we saw very strong improvements in the first quarter of 2014. Our CET1 capital improved $7 billion driven by earnings, OCI improvement, as well as well as lower threshold deductions. The numbers in the chart reflects risk weighted assets under the standardized approach with our CET1 ratio improving from 9% to 9.5%, well above our 8.5%, 2019 proposed minimum requirement. Under the advanced approach, our CET 1 ratio improved from 9.6% at the end of the first quarter of 2014 to 9.9%. That was driven by the improvement in our capital, partially offset by an increase in risk-weighted assets. If we turn to the supplementary leverage ratios, we estimate that at the end of the second quarter of 2014, we exceeded the updated US rules that are applicable beginning in 2018. Our bank holding company exceeds the 5% minimum and our primary bank subsidiaries, BANA and FIA are both in excess of the 6% minimum. If we turn to Slide 5 on funding and liquidity, our long-term debt of $257 billion was up modestly during the quarter as our debt issuances were larger than maturities during the period. As we look forward at our debt issuance during the balance of the year, we\u2019ll continue to be opportunistic but we do expect our parent issuance to be below the $13 billion of contractual maturities in the second half of 2014. We\u2019ll also likely to continue to issue term debt out of our primary bank subsidiaries. Our second quarter 2014 long-term debt yields improved 12 basis points from the first quarter of 2014 2.29%. We realized significant improvements given only two years ago this yield was over 3% and our average debt balances were nearly $75 billion higher. Our total global excess liquidity sources during the quarter increased to a record $431 billion as bank liquidity continue to grow in the second quarter and our time to required funding remained strong at 38 months. If we turn to Slide 6, our net interest income on a reported FTE basis was $10.2 billion, consistent with the first quarter of 2014 is a less negative impact from market-related adjustments was offset by an anticipated decline in the core net interest income. Negatively impacting our reported net interest income during the quarter were market-related adjustments of $175 million and that compares to $273 million negative in the first quarter of 2014, as you all know, long-term rates declined again during the quarter. Our net interest income, if we exclude the market-related adjustments declined as previously expected and communicated, due to seasonally lower average consumer loan balances and yields offset by an extra day of interest and all of that resulted in net interest income of $10.4 billion. As a result of the increased liquidity in the first half of the year, as well as lower loan balances and loan yields, the net interest yield excluding market-related adjustments declined 10 basis points to 2.26%. We continue to thoughtfully manage our OCI sensitivity and are very mindful of the liquidity and leverage rules as this quarter we invested more into shorter duration treasury securities. We continue to remain positioned to benefit if interest rates move higher, particularly from the shorter end of the curve. And as we head into the back half of 2014, we still expect modest improvement off of the second quarter of 2014 level of net interest income, which was $10.4 billion, excluding market-related adjustments. Non-interest expense on Slide 7 was $18.5 billion during the second quarter and once again included $4 billion of litigation expense. As we mentioned, $3.8 billion of the litigation expense relate to a build in reserves associated with previously disclosed legacy mortgage related matters including the AIG agreement. If we exclude litigation, total expenses were $14.6 billion this quarter. If we compare those to the first quarter of 2014 and exclude retirement eligible costs that we saw during the first quarter of 2014, our expenses declined $700 million on the lower incentives related to sales and trading revenue, reduced LAS non-litigation expense and to a lesser extent New BAC savings. Our legacy assets and servicing expenses during the quarter ex litigation were $1.4 billion and declined approximately $150 million from the first quarter of 2014. As we look forward with respect to our two expense programs, New BAC as well as our LAS expenses ex litigation, we have modified our expectations slightly. Our New BAC expense program is ahead of schedule and we now expect to reach a quarterly level of $2 billion in expense savings in the fourth quarter of 2014 as opposed to mid 2015. This means on an annualized basis, we will have fully achieved the $8 billion target that we announced in 2011. In the second quarter of 2014, our quarterly savings rate that was achieved on New BAC was $1.8 billion plus. Moving to our LAS expenses ex litigation, we continue to make very good progress, but our compliance with applicable mortgage programs as well as governance guidelines may delay the expected timing of achieving our $1.1 billion goal by one quarter. If we turn to asset quality on Slide 8, you can see credit quality once again improved on all fronts. Net charge-offs declined $315 million from the first quarter of 2014 to $1.1 billion or a 48 basis points net loss ratio. As I mentioned earlier, this quarter did include a $2.1 billion sales of bulk non-performing loans, which included recoveries of $185 million on previously recorded net charge-offs. If we exclude the effect of the bulk sale net charge-offs, they\u2019ve declined a $130 million or 9% and the net loss ratio would have been at 56 basis points. These are decade level loans. Delinquencies, a leading indicator of net charge-offs also showed improvement during the second quarter. Provision expense during the quarter was $411 and we released $662 million of reserves. We would expect net charge-offs going forward to continue to show modest improvement from the second quarter of 2014 levels of $1.3 billion, which excluded the recoveries that we received on the non-performing loan sales. We would also expect reserve releases to decline modestly through the balance of 2014. Let\u2019s walk through the business segment results now starting on Slide 9 with consumer and business banking. We continue to make solid progress on the strategy in this business through deepening relationships and reducing our costs by optimizing the delivery network. We are simplifying the product set as we reduce the number of offers, offerings and focus the smaller product sets on customer feedback and offer greater rewards to customers who bring us more of their relationships. Some of the more significant operational activity during the quarter included the rollout of an advanced platform for mobile banking that had added functionality, rolling out the safe balance checking account, as well as an enhanced preferred rewards program that we launched after a successful pilot program. We are pleased with the results again this quarter as our earnings of $1.8 billion grew $29% from the second quarter of 2013 and were up 7% from the first quarter of 2014. This business generated a 24% return on allocated capital during the quarter. Our revenue was relatively stable across the periods as lower net interest income was partially offset by higher service charges. Our expenses are down 4% from the second quarter of 2013 and lower operating, litigation and personnel costs. Our network delivery optimization benefit continued as we reduced another 72 banking centers through both sales as well as consolidations. Our credit quality remains strong as net charge-offs decline versus both periods. Our U.S. credit card business exited the quarter with less than a 3% loss rate in June. Second quarter provision expense was $534 million, our net charge-offs improved $313 million from the second quarter of 2013 and $36 million from the first quarter of 2014. We released $120 million more in reserves this quarter than the second quarter of 2013 and $242 million more than the first quarter of 2014. From a customer activity perspective this quarter, we saw continued growth in our mobile banking customers which reached 15.5 million customers and our customer deposit transactions using mobile devices represented 10% of all transactions. Our average deposits of $544 billion are up organically almost $11 billion or 2% compared to the first quarter of 2014 and up 5% or nearly $25 billion compared to the second quarter of 2013 and we did that as our rates paid on our deposits reached a new low of 6 basis points. Our brokerage assets surpassed $105 billion and are up 26% year-over-year based on both improved market valuations as well as customer flows. Our card issuance remained strong at 1.1 million new accounts in the second quarter of 2014 with approximately two-thirds of those cards going to existing customers. We saw growth in ending U.S. credit card balances this period with ending balances up $1.3 billion relative to the first quarter of 2014 and our risk-adjusted margin remains strong at approximately 9%. If you move to consumer real estate services, the loss in the quarter was driven by $3.8 billion of litigation expense. Overall, we saw higher originations, improved mortgage banking revenues, and lower cost in both the fulfillment as well as the servicing sides of the business. Let\u2019s focus first on the reported sub-segments of home loans where we record the origination of consumer real estates. Our home loans saw better leverage versus the first quarter of 2014 as both revenues and expenses improved. Our first mortgage retail origination were $11.1 billion and were up 25% from the first quarter of 2015 leading to higher core production revenues. As Brian mentioned, our mix of originations continued to shift to purchase as we are now at 47% purchased versus 17% in the year ago quarter. At the end of the quarter, our origination pipeline was up 15% from the first quarter of 2014, but our applications per day are slowing a bit. Our home equity originations were $2.6 billion and increased 31% from the first quarter of 2014. We continued to reduce production staffing levels and the savings from several quarters of these reductions are beginning to show in our expense levels. If we move to the legacy assets and servicing sub-segment, the driver here was aforementioned litigation costs. From a cost of servicing perspective, our LAS expenses ex litigation did declined $141 million to $1.4 billion and our number of 60 plus day delinquent loans dropped 14,000 units to 263,000 units or down 5% from the end of the first quarter of 2014. The primary revenue component in our LAS sub-segment servicing fees declined $40 million versus the first quarter as the size of our servicing portfolios declined. This was offset by a better net hedge performance on our MSRs. Also during the quarter, we did benefit from lower rep and warrant provisions which was $87 million or down nearly $100 million from the first quarter of 2014. If we turn to Slide 11, global wealth and investment management, this business turned in another record revenue quarter, our pre-tax margins remained strong north of 25% for the sixth consecutive quarter. Our revenue of $4.6 billion was up 2% from the second quarter of 2013 and 1% over the first quarter of 2014. Record asset management fees offset the softness in transactional activity. Net income, $724 million was slightly lower than both comparative periods, driven by increased expenses. Our expense levels versus the second quarter of 2013 reflect higher revenue-related incentive comps, other volume-related costs, as well as continued investments in technology and other areas that support the growth that we are seeing within the business. Relative to the first quarter of 2014, expenses were driven by higher revenue-related costs, litigation-related expenses as well as marketing. Our return on allocated capital during the quarter was 24%. The momentum we are seeing in flows continued and was quite strong during the quarter. Client balances were up $72 billion from the end of the first quarter of 2014 to a record $2.5 trillion. Long-term AUM flows were nearly $12 billion for the quarter marking the fifth straight year of positive quarterly AUM flows. Our ending client loan balances were up $3.9 billion to a record $123 billion, which is up 3% from the first quarter of 2014 as we saw growth in both our securities-based lending as well as our residential mortgage lending. From a referral perspective, we continued to see coordinated efforts across wealth management and the banking groups as our referrals resulted in the funding of more than 250 institutional retirement plans worth more than 2.4 billion assets this quarter and that compares to a 156 wins in the year ago quarter of 600 million assets. If we turn to Slide 12, our global banking earnings for the quarter were $1.4 billion, up 4% from the second quarter of 2013 and up 9% over the first quarter of 2014. Our return on allocated capital was very strong at 18%. Compared to the second quarter of 2013, our revenue showed modest improvement while expenses increased and credit cost declined. Within the revenue category, our investment banking fees, company-wide this quarter were $1.6 billion, up 5% from the second quarter of 2013 and up 6% on a linked quarter basis. We maintained a solid leadership position in investment banking fees and we had particularly strong equity underwriting results during the quarter. Our provision was $132 million during the quarter and included a $156 million reserve build. Our provision costs were favorable to both comparative periods as we added less reserves in the first quarter of 2014 and had less charge-offs compared to the second quarter of 2013. Expenses increased $50 million versus the second quarter of 2013 on higher litigation, but improved $129 million from the first quarter of 2014 on lower personnel and back-office support costs. If we look at the balance sheet, average loans were $271 billion during the quarter, up 6% compared to the second quarter of 2013, but flattish compared to the first quarter of 2014. Our loan balances relative to the first quarter of 2014 bear \u2013 I think several comments, but I\u2019d like to make the first is, we saw sizable pay-downs during the quarter as our customers accessed the capital markets. We had approximately $2 billion of such pay-downs where our customers chose access to markets and refinanced existing bank loans. Within commercial real estate, we continued to optimize the mix with several small portfolio sales that took those balances down, little over $2 billion. We are being sensitive with respect to pricing of commercial loans as we are not going to chase loans at the expense of overall client relationship profitability goals. And lastly within the global banking segment, deposit flows remained solid and were stronger at the end of the quarter. If we move to global markets on Slide 13, we earned $1.1 billion in the second quarter of 2014, that\u2019s up 14% from the year ago period and down seasonally 16% from the seasonally strong period of the first quarter. Net DVAs during the quarter was a gain of $69 million versus gains of $49 million in the second quarter of 2013 and a $112 million in the first quarter of 2014. Despite the slowdown in FICC across the industry group, we were pleased with the results this quarter. Our revenue was up 9% from the second quarter of 2013, but down 9% from the seasonally high first quarter of 2014. Our second quarter of 2014 revenue did include an equity gain of roughly $240 million on the modernization of an equity investment. That is not reflected as part of our sales and trading revenues. Our sales and trading revenue net of DVA was $3.4 billion which was 1% lower than the second quarter of 2013 and 17% lower than the first quarter of 2014. Our FICC sales and trading revenue during the quarter increased 5% compared to the second quarter of 2013 and was down 20% from the seasonally higher first quarter of 2014 levels. Driving the year-over-year improvement within fixed were results in our mortgage business, our munis business, as trading conditions and our performance improved in both areas. Those improvements were partially offset by weaker financial performance in foreign exchange as well as commodities. On the equity sales and trading side, we were down 14% from the second quarter of 2013 and 11% from the first quarter of 2014 as lower market volatility depressed overall secondary market client activity. Expenses were up from the second quarter of 2013 on higher technology and staff support investments and to a lesser degree incentives, but down from the first quarter of 2014 in line with the seasonal revenue decline that we saw. Trading-related assets on average increased $23 billion to $460 billion during the quarter and our return on allocated capital was 13% during the second quarter. On Slide 14, we show all other; revenue was down $463 million from the first quarter of 2014 and lower equity investment gains of $618 million which were partially offset by lower negative market-related adjustments to net interest income during the quarter. Our second quarter 2014 expense and all other is down $1.3 billion from the first quarter as it included retirement eligible incentive costs and some litigation expense. The second quarter of 2014 provision benefit of $246 million was $111 better than the first quarter of 2014 and $67 million better than the second quarter of 2013. Net charge-offs of $11 million improved $195 million from the first quarter of 2014 driven by the recoveries that I had mentioned associated with our bulk NPL sales. During the quarter, our effective tax rate was relatively low, primarily as a result of the impact of tax preference items on a lower earnings base. For the back half of 2014, we would expect to see an effective tax rate of approximately 31% ex any unusual items. I am going to wrap up before we take questions with a couple closing comments. We feel like we made very strong progress during the quarter. We saw good business activity across the customer base. We experienced year-over-year revenue growth in our global banking, global markets and global wealth management businesses. Our consumer business profitability grew 29% from last year and in the mortgage business we are taking cost out of the fulfillment side as well as the cost to service our delinquent loans. We reported $0.19 of earnings and absorbed cost allowing us to resolve all outstanding RMBS issues with AIG and build substantial reserves for our remaining legacy mortgage issues. We did this while adding to our already strong Basel 3 capital ratios and improving our liquidity measures to record levels and our asset quality improved to decade low loss ratios. And with that, we\u2019ll go ahead and open it up for questions. Operator :  (Operator Instructions) And we\u2019ll take our first quarter from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley :  Hey, thanks. Good morning. Brian Moynihan :  Good morning. Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley :  Hey, a couple questions. One, you had some callouts on some nice gains and I know a couple of other banks reporting here this cycle have done the same thing. I\u2019m wondering how much more in your pipeline do you think you have to extract some value from the mortgage-related portfolio here that you're in the process of selling down (inaudible)? Bruce Thompson :  We took, Betsy, a piece of our non-performing loans out and as non-performing loans and as you know, when you receive it, to the extent that you receive income you write down the basis for those loans and we took those loans out and saw healthy gains. We continue to look at the sale of non-performing loans, but I would not expect anything near the magnitude from the sale of non-performing loans that we saw this quarter. Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley :  Okay, separately, on just litigation related stuff you highlighted the AIG agreement that \u2013 it looks like a great win for you guys. I guess the question is does them pulling out as a dissenter do anything to speed up the timing on that Article 77 case? Bruce Thompson :  I think the \u2013 the timing is going to progress on the schedule that it otherwise would have \u2013 I think you all know that from an objector perspective that they were probably the strongest and most vocal objector with respect to the case and we\u2019ll just have to see as we move forward what the impacts from them dropping their objection to the cases. I think the other thing that\u2019s important is as it relates to holding of the securities or at least a basis to object, but they were the largest holder that was out there from holding securities as part of the settlement. I think they noted that in the release this morning. Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley :  Yep, thanks. Okay and then just lastly, it\u2019s been a lot of debate recently about how the Fed could potentially start to exit. Obviously in the [inaudible] they talked about that, and it sounds there were calls recently about how people are thinking about rate betas. I know from the Q you have a relatively positive outlook for what rising rate does to your earnings stream. Could you just remind us what percentage of your deposits are consumer and how you are thinking about rate betas in a rate rise environment relative to asset betas? Bruce Thompson :  Sure, couple of things, if you look at asset sensitivity, you\u2019ll see that the exposure to a 100 basis point parallel shift in rate, that the benefit increased this quarter from about $3.2 billion in the first quarter to $3.4 billion. As you look at the deposit base, a couple of things of note, the first is, north of 70% of the overall deposits that we have throughout the company are within our consumer and wealth management business and as it relates to \u2013 I would say overall asset betas that through history given the branch network and the relationships those tend to be very stable. I think you get a sense for that as you look at the continued deposit growth that we\u2019ve seen while at the same time taking rates paid down pretty significantly. If you move to the institutional side, and look at where we are, roughly 75% of the deposits that we have within the institutional business are domiciled here in the U.S. and the predominant mix of that is with our core corporate and commercial customers and if you look at the reason that they are holding those deposits with us is because we tend to be their core relationship bank. We do their cash management, we do their treasury service revenue and have relationships that are beyond just a place for them to put their deposits. So, as we move forward, there is obviously a level of uncertainty to the extent of a Fed withdrawal, but as we look at the overall deposit base, the stability of it and our outlook going forward, we feel like that we\u2019re very well positioned. Brian Moynihan : I would add on the consumer side also as you look at year-over-year dynamics in terms of deposit growth of $25 billion, also look at this, we are still running off a CD portfolios that was more of a funding portfolios for some of the companies that we acquired. So that I think there is a round number of $10 billion reduction in CDs over that time period and we\u2019ve also obviously sold some deposits not a huge amount. So that growth is over top of all that and net. So, we feel good about the consumer franchise ability to continue to grow deposits even while being very disciplined on price and as rates rise, that value will be recognized and we expect those deposits now are much more core, you have the checking account deposit year-over-year I think were up to 25% to 30% in terms of average balance. Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley :  Okay. Thanks a lot. Operator :  And we\u2019ll go next to Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead. Jim Mitchell \u2013 Buckingham Research :  Yes, hey, good morning. I just wanted to follow-up quickly up on that deposit question. I noticed that non-interest bearing was up 11%; interest-bearing up only 1%. So that speaks to your efforts. Do you think there is more to go there or should we start to see deposit growth more in line with your peers at this point? Brian Moynihan : I think if you look at the - just on the consumer business, the year-over-year growth was $25 billion and the linked quarter growth was $10 billion so obviously we are growing at a faster rate in the current environment, at the spots so to speak Jim than we have been year-over-year. And so the growth rate of 2% was nominal in a quarter which would be annualized 8% about high 5% to 6% year-over-year. So, it\u2019s accelerating still by the good core activity. Jim Mitchell \u2013 Buckingham Research :  Right, okay, great, and then on loan growth, you still have \u2013 as you mentioned, a couple of asset sales, still some legacy asset run-offs. When do we start to see the inflection point in your view and maybe if you can give us a sense of underlying demand that you are seeing in your customer group? Bruce Thompson :  Sure, let\u2019s go \u2013 it\u2019s a very good question Jim and I think we need to break out and discuss \u2013 if you look at the declines that we saw in the residential mortgage area, that those are largely due to whole loan repayments of loans that are held within our investment portfolio. And so if you look at the consumer business, I think there are couple of key things that I would note. The first is, on a linked quarter basis, this is the first quarter in some time where we actually saw ending card balances within our domestic card balance increase and those were up as we mentioned roughly $1.3 billion from the first quarter to the second quarter. So we saw growth there and then if you move to what we saw within the wealth management area as I mentioned, we saw very strong growth both in securities based lending as well as within mortgage origination there. Once again on the home equity front, the progress that we are making on the origination front where we saw about $2.6 billion is really being masked by the run-off and the amortization of the home equity book that we have that runs off to the extent of $3 billion to $4 billion a quarter. So, within the consumer businesses, if you look at kind of the core front-end, we are seeing some consumer loan growth that just gets masked by the run-off of some of the consumer real estate. On the overall commercial and corporate side, I did referenced the couple pay-offs. As we look at one of the benchmarks that we look at is the revolver draws that we have within our commercial banking business, that number which had gotten as low as in the low 30s was up almost 100 basis points this quarter, and it\u2019s now in the high 30s. So we are starting to see some greater activity on the revolver space within our commercial banking customers and overall activity with the corporate customers continues to be good but we are seeing \u2013 as I reference customers taking advantage of favorable debt capital markets which we obviously benefit from a debt underwriting perspective. Jim Mitchell \u2013 Buckingham Research :  Right, that's fair. Just one last question on the LCR, did you \u2013 maybe I missed it, did you disclose where you are on that front? Bruce Thompson :  We did not, at the parent at this point, we are above 100% at the parent, so we are good from a 2017 compliance there. If we look at the combined BANA and FIA LCR ratios, those two companies or two banks will be put together October 1, that LCR numbers in the high 80s at this point and we\u2019ll continue to build the LCR ratio at the banks to be at least a year ahead of where we need to be. Jim Mitchell \u2013 Buckingham Research :  Will that put any further pressure on NIM if you are building more liquidity there? Bruce Thompson :  It should not, there \u2013 as we look at, there has been a significant build at this point and as we look at the funding and the balance of that between both core consumer deposit growth as well as where we are that should not have an effect. If you look at the build that we talked about in the first quarter and second quarter, at this point I would say we\u2019ve eaten that expense and we now need to get after it and optimize to get the expense knocked back down. Jim Mitchell \u2013 Buckingham Research :  Okay, great. Thanks. Operator :  And we\u2019ll go next to Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Matt O'Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank :  Hi, good morning. Bruce Thompson :  Good morning Matt. Matt O'Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank :  On expenses, it seems like most of the New BAC savings are in the run rate here, yet we still read about \u2013 some various expense initiatives that you have underway in terms of branch rationalization and simplification and things like that. So, just wondering is there another New BAC or just ongoing efforts to bring down costs and how meaningful those might be? Brian Moynihan :  I think in the near-term Matt, the number one thing about cost is continue to work down the LAS legacy costs down to a more normalized level on a per loan basis and also keep producing the number of delinquent loans. So, that\u2019s the real expense leverage and what Bruce talked about earlier is we get to make sure we do it the right way especially in connection with sort of finishing up some of the regulatory work there. That\u2019s the real large dollar amount. You are pointing out exactly that situation on the core, you run at about $13 billion a quarter on core expenses, not a bad number if you annualize it and sort of think that through but the real question is how do you hold it there and keep investing in the businesses. And so when we started the New BAC, we never gave a target that said, we are going to save of this money but we are going to reinvest that we gave you a sort of net target and now we are reaching that. And so, what we would challenge our teams too is how to maintain a good operating leverage going forward and so we are more about simplifying the company and continuing to take out expenses. But a lot of that will offset the 1000 people we\u2019ve added in the branches that we sell more products if you are seeing the benefit of the continued adds we make in the wealth management business and training programs. We hired a 30% or 40% more people out of schools this year because we got to keep replenishing our talent base, commercial bankers et cetera. So, as you look forward, the inflationary type things that go on, merit raises and healthcare expenses and stuff like that and investing in the business including the $3 billion plus we put in technology developments every year will need to be offset by hard expense work and so that\u2019s the plan we have and we are putting this, we keep driving those plans in place. So there will be less bottom-line reduction on the core expense base and more how you hold it there in a relatively slow growth environment. Matt O'Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank :  Okay, so just to try and summarize, even if there is some modest revenue growth, you would hope to keep that $13 billion relatively stable on a net basis, then? Brian Moynihan :  Yes, if we want accept them, when markets kicks up you are going to have more comp related to that or wealth management comp which is good. So, you got to be careful, because those things kind of come and go and you can see that just the last couple of quarters. But, if you think what David Darnell and the team have done in the retail business, they are still rationalizing the branch structure which will offset putting more people in the branches that are more personal bankers and FSAs. And they\u2019ve done a pretty good job at offsetting that. In addition we are repatriating some jobs to help on the consumer credit \u2013 customer delight scores and stuffs from places that legacy enterprises had in other places and bringing them in and that rationalization is going on and that\u2019s adding to our job count in the near term but we\u2019ll rationalize back out. Matt O'Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank :  Okay. And then on the LAS cost, obviously making good progress there and I am not sure there is too much concern if it gets pushed out one quarter. But is there still the goal of getting down to $500 million or below $500 million per quarter? Bruce Thompson :  Yes, and that\u2019s going to trail and move with this. We drive down the 60 plus day delinquent loans, but clearly the $1.1 billion that we\u2019ll either have in the fourth quarter or the first quarter of next year is still way too high given the number of 60 plus day delinquent loans that we have as well as the size of the servicing portfolio. Matt O'Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank :  Okay, and then just lastly if I can squeeze in on the CCAR capital resubmission process, just remind us when you expect to get an update on that? Bruce Thompson :  Sure. We submitted our materials to the Fed on May 27. They have up to 75 days to respond. I believe the 75th day is August 10 and we continue to see where they come up. Matt O'Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank :  Okay, thank you. Operator :  And we\u2019ll go to next to Glenn Schorr with ISI. Please go ahead. Glenn Schorr \u2013 ISI Group :  Thank you. Quick question on the match book was up or at least the Fed funds sold and repurchased on the asset side was up 6.5% quarter-on-quarter. It's the opposite of what we're seeing at a lot of banks and trends in the market. So I am just curious is there an opportunity to get closer to clients? Is this a function of the fact that your SLR is in great shape so why not use it when you can? Just curious on what is underlying that trend? Bruce Thompson :  Yes, I would think, Glenn, probably more than anything if you go back and look at both the notional size of the balance sheet as well as the match book, we were probably a little bit lower at the end of 2014 - the end of the first quarter of 2014 than you would normally see. So, that number will bounce around, but I wouldn\u2019t read anything into the fact that it was up because it was much lower at both the end of 2013 as well as the first quarter of 2014. Glenn Schorr \u2013 ISI Group :  Anything different on the client usage front? It is bucking a trend though I hear your comments on the year-end. It's just with the changes in SLR, it's changing pricing theoretically, I just don't know if it's more theoretical than actual. Bruce Thompson :  I think the pricing is probably more theoretical because if you look across the industry we continue to see both the banks in Europe as well as the banks in Asia provide at so, I am not sure you\u2019re seeing any meaningful movement in what you are able to charge from a match book perspective. Glenn Schorr \u2013 ISI Group :  I get that, yes thanks. Okay, switching gears, in wealth management, obviously everything is doing pretty darn good in wealth management. But I\u2019ll pick a little bit and I\u2019ll just ask, expense \u2013 negative operating leverage in a quarter when the markets are doing well, meaning revenues were up or expenses are up more. I heard and saw your comments on the additional investments in technology. Is it comp or is it that additional investment technology? In other words, when markets are growing and flows are great you would expect margins to hold their ground, not give it up. Maybe a little more color on what investments to help that business grow would be helpful? Bruce Thompson :  Sure, well you\u2019ve got a couple things, the first is that as you look at the expense growth during the quarter, and you look at the buckets roughly, half of it relates to incentive related comp that is a result of increased revenues. We do have a couple of initiatives that you\u2019d expect to roll off over the next couple quarters within the wealth management business. We obviously have the rollout of Merrill One over the last couple of quarters where you saw some expense there. There we spent some additional money spend as we invest in system related to retirement systems and retirement programs as we continue to see growth there. And so, you do have some of that activity as well as just making sure that the right investment within the various control support functions are appropriate. So \u2013 at the same time, as we look forward, you need to see positive operating leverage not negative operating leverage and that\u2019s what we\u2019ll look to work for as we go through the next couple quarters of the year. Brian Moynihan :  You point out, I mean, it\u2019s an obvious point and we \u2013 the team is focused on it, but we have made some near term investments including training programs and hiring people into the business working to the branches and stuff to help, but it something that we got to monitor closely and we think it will come back down and more in line with what you would expect. Glenn Schorr \u2013 ISI Group :  Great, I appreciate that. Last one is, slide 20 shows that the private-label outstanding claims keep going up every quarter. Anything new there? I am not sure what's driving that and if \u2013 I know that we have most of this stuff accounts for in the settlements, but just curious? Bruce Thompson :  I think that the notable think that I would call out is that when we get private-label claims that comp, there are two different types of claims that come in, there is the first that our claims where people have had the ability to look at loan files and submit a claim based on a loan file, not being what they\u2019ve thought it be and the second is that, you can have people that at points in time do what we call or throw in what we would characterize as a bulk claim where they are just throwing it in without having done any work whatsoever on the loan file. And what\u2019s important when you look at what we saw during the second quarter of 2014 we saw roughly $1.9 billion of original unpaid balance on the loans not loss, gross of that amount, the amount of bulk claims were no file reviews and went down was $1.9 billion. So, I would not read too much into that number because it\u2019s not for loan files where there has been any work done and I would just say generally if you look at what we\u2019ve seen regarding some of the recent decisions where there seems to be some stickiness at this point on different statutes of limitations as well as a recent ruling that came out of California with respect to RMBS litigation that we do feel like we are moving forward and getting AIG behind us is significant in regards to putting the rest of this behind us. Sure, Glenn Schorr \u2013 ISI Group :  Okay. I appreciate it. That's it for me. Thanks. Operator :  And we\u2019ll go next to Jon McDonald with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead. Jonathan McDonald \u2013 Sanford Bernstein :  Hi, good morning. Bruce, the increase in Tier-1 common of $7 billion was impressive relative to the net income in the quarter. Any more color on the drivers there? You mentioned AOCI. What were the threshold deductions that helped drive the capital expansion so much more than that income? Bruce Thompson :  Sure, so, as we\u2019ve said, given where we are from a disallowed DTA position that we\u2019re at a point where broadly speaking, we accrete capital on a pre-tax as opposed to an after-tax basis and so, as you look at the results we had roughly $3 billion of pre-tax income. We had roughly $3.5 billion of pre-tax OCIs that gets you to above $6.5 billion and then as you look at threshold deductions of roughly 10%, take 10% of that $6.5 billion, it gets you roughly $700 million, that gets you to roughly $7.2 billion of capital build, you back out the common dividend of 100 and that gets you to your $7.1 billion build. Jonathan McDonald \u2013 Sanford Bernstein :  Okay and that building at a pre-tax due to the DTA, that\u2019s something that should continue on a steady pace, right? Bruce Thompson :  Clearly, at least over the next \u2013 I would say, probably two to four quarters it will be a function of the exact earnings but, for the near term that\u2019s correct. Jonathan McDonald \u2013 Sanford Bernstein :  Okay and can you give us the numbers on what the excluded DTA is today and what it changed in during the quarter? Bruce Thompson :  I believe that the excluded DTA was roughly $15 billion and it was down over \u2013 little over $1 billion. Jonathan McDonald \u2013 Sanford Bernstein :  Okay. On RWA, are there risks that the continued legal settlements would drive up your operational risk metrics or is there a forward-looking component to the op risk calc that already anticipates more settlements coming? Bruce Thompson :  Yes, we are mindful of the fact of settlements, there is obviously a lot of discussion and dialogues around op risk RWA. If you look at and when we noted that the reason risk-weighted assets went up during the quarter under the advanced approach, it was we are doing exactly what you referenced was reflecting an increased amount of operational risk RWA. We don\u2019t give the exact number, but you should assume that that amount is in the 26% to 27% of our total risk-weighted assets number and is in line with our largest peer. Jonathan McDonald \u2013 Sanford Bernstein :  Okay. On capital, on the last CCAR your binding constraint was the leverage ratio more than the risk-based Tier 1 minimum. I assume the recent preferred issuance and the Buffett conversions will help close that gap and position you better for next year's CCAR minimum. Could you comment on that? Or are there more things you can do to close the gap and have a quantitative cushion that's bigger to that leverage ratio next year as well? Bruce Thompson :  Well, the first John, is jut to manage the notional size of the balance sheet which we continue to do. The second thing that I would note is, when you look at the sale of the re-performing loans that we did, those are the types of assets that in the CCAR at least we believe we don\u2019t have access to the federal reserves\u2019 models, but those are types of assets that tend to get hard. So, we continue to look hard and look to drive down the non-performing consumer real estate piece of what we have and this quarter was a good example of it. And then, you are exactly right, with respect to the leverage ratio that there is a benefit that that preferred stock gives with north of $4 billion this quarter that we generated will continue to look to see if more preferred makes sense and then lastly, we\u2019ll continue to look at and see if sub that makes sense from a total capital perspective as well. The incremental cost of those is very low and we just want to make sure the balance sheet is optimized for those different buckets. Jonathan McDonald \u2013 Sanford Bernstein :  Okay, thanks and on sales and trading, just in terms of the dynamics of the quarter, did you see a pickup in June as the other banks did? And any sense of what drove that? Have you seen any follow-through on that? Bruce Thompson :  Yes, our activity levels and \u2013 if you saw a P&L throughout the quarter, while June was marginally better, I would characterize the activity that we saw within the sales and trading business during the second quarter to be fairly consistent. And if we look out at the third quarter, typically with the summer the third quarter is a little bit seasonally slower than the second quarter. If you look at our results last year, you\u2019ll see that and as we come into the third quarter, there is nothing unusual in our third quarter numbers of last year and how we compare to those numbers is going to be a function of how well we perform this quarter and that\u2019s obviously up to us. Brian Moynihan :  John, if you look at page 19, you can see the second quarter, second quarter, second quarter, across the last three years and it\u2019s remarkably stable in terms of markets revenue lower part of that page. And so, Tom and the team did a \u2013 a few years ago we actually reduced the headcount almost 5000 people and that\u2019s allowed us to make $1 billion in this current environment as we did this quarter. So, this ebb and flow as you and I\u2019ve talked about in various occasions, it is a core part of what we do. But we show you the separate P&L, we show that from the first quarter half a good quarter, this quarter had a $1 billion bucks and it may come down as activity moves around the clients but it\u2019s a relatively stable revenue base that we can make money on because of the expense adjustments we made last year \u2013 in the last couple of years. Jonathan McDonald \u2013 Sanford Bernstein :  Okay and last thing for me, Bruce, on the CRES page, in terms of mortgage servicing revenues, is this quarter's core mortgage servicing revenue a stable base as you see it? Or is there further shrinkage in the size of the servicing book from sales that are ongoing that would impact the servicing fee? Bruce Thompson :  Yes, there we\u2019ve got one more sales that we\u2019ll look to wrap up this quarter that\u2019s got fairly high consent of 60 plus day delinquent loans. But beyond that, that one transfer this quarter were largely at the end of servicing sales and we are at a base of what you see should be what we have going forward with the plusses and minuses being what runs off versus what we put on. Jonathan McDonald \u2013 Sanford Bernstein :  Okay. You're still taking rep and warranty provisions. What are those for? Is that for current originations, or is it still catch-up from past stuff? Bruce Thompson :  As you look at I think, rep and warrant was less than $100 million this quarter. You are going to always have that as you go forward, but we are not seeing much rep and warrant at all on recent originations that\u2019s going to be more legacy related. Jonathan McDonald \u2013 Sanford Bernstein :  Okay, thank you. Bruce Thompson :  Thank you, John. Operator :  And we\u2019ll go next to Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous. Please go ahead. Guy Moszkowski \u2013 Autonomous Research :  Thanks, good morning. First question I had was just a follow-up on CRES. Is there any sort of immediate benefit in terms of the ability to accelerate LAS legacy servicing cost reductions now because of the bulk sale? Bruce Thompson :  From a number of units perspective, as you look at the bulk sales over the \u2013 there is a piece of it that was \u2013 that we service and the results of a piece that others service. So in the context of the number of 60 plus day delinquent loans it was not meaningful relative to the total. Guy Moszkowski \u2013 Autonomous Research :  Got it. So what we're really looking at is more what you were talking about in response to John's question a minute ago, which is the potential for one more sale this quarter and then just normal run-off. Bruce Thompson :  That\u2019s correct. Guy Moszkowski \u2013 Autonomous Research :  Got it. Question for you while we're on the topic of mortgage stuff. Obviously you had the $4 billion litigation reserve build essentially this quarter. It appears, based on what you gave as an after-tax impact that you take a full tax benefit against that. Of course, what we find with a lot of these things, especially with like the DOJ settlements is that a large amount is not deductible. Do you have any flexibility with respect to being able to use a lower tax rate? Bruce Thompson :  A couple things, we don\u2019t give the exact numbers, but if you go back and look at the first quarter, we look at and try to understand what the tax treatment is for the different settlement. There was a piece of it in the first quarter that we would have assumed was not tax deductible and you are right, the piece that \u2013 and the reserves that we took this quarter there was a presumption that it was tax deductible. And the short answer is, until you get to the end, you don\u2019t know the exact mix. But we try to be thoughtful with that and I would just say as it relates to the total number, as we said last quarter, there was $2.4 billion of litigation expense over and above what was for settlement. In this quarter you got in the high threes and I think it gives you a sense as to the magnitude of the reserves that are built over the last two quarters. Guy Moszkowski \u2013 Autonomous Research :  Got it. Switching topics, you did talk about pricing on commercial loans in the context of not seeing a meaningful increase in commercial loan balances this quarter, and I guess alluded to some discipline that you're exercising. Can you talk a little bit about the conditions that you're seeing in the commercial loan market and where you think there is froth? Bruce Thompson :  Sure, if you look at an embedded under the global banking segment, we\u2019ve got the loans that are done within our corporate investment bank that tend to be for the larger companies and as we look at spreads and yields on a linked quarter basis, within our business, we saw relative stability in the yields in those businesses. And, as we look out at in the marketplace given that those loans that are brought for those customers tend to be broadly syndicated and there tends to be a relationship in the yield between that and where they can access capital in the capital market, that low in pricing over the last quarter has hung in there and like I said it was generally flat, Q1 to Q2. I would say, we tend to see a little bit more of a competitive pressure tends to be within the base commercial bank which is for middle-market companies where that they tend to be more one, two, or three bank deals and we have seen that area continues to be pretty competitive and we are just being disciplined with how we approach that market and given the footprint that we have, we do have the flexibility to not chase things within some of these regional markets. Guy Moszkowski \u2013 Autonomous Research :  And just to follow-up on that, when you say banks competing for that business, are you using the word bank in a traditional sense or are you actually seeing a lot of the competition for those type of mid-market loans coming from outside of what we would think of as the traditional banking sector? Bruce Thompson :  No, I would \u2013 for the core commercial customer, that\u2019s going to be the traditional banking customer as you think of it. Guy Moszkowski \u2013 Autonomous Research :  Okay and then just a housekeeping question, just to make sure I understand what you were saying. You said there were \u2013 maybe $250 million of gains in Global Markets, I guess, probably \u2013 not to put words in your mouth, but things like market. And you \u2013 but I think you said that you did not include those numbers in the core equities or fixed income segment revenues. Is that right? Bruce Thompson :  Yes, but that\u2019s correct so we had a position that went public during the quarter. There was a gain and it\u2019s reflected in the revenues of the global market segment. But we did not think that was appropriate to include that in the core FICC and equity sales and trading. So if you go to the table on page 13, when you look at that FICC and equity sales and trading number ex DVA that that does not include any benefit from the gain that we saw within the overall segment during the quarter. Guy Moszkowski \u2013 Autonomous Research :  Got it, perfect. Thanks for the clarification. Bruce Thompson :  Sure. Operator :  And we\u2019ll go next to Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Moshe Orenbuch \u2013 Credit Suisse :  Great, thanks. I was wondering; you've got a little less than $250 billion of residential real estate loans and $90 billion of home equity. How much do you think those decline before those stabilize, because I think you tried to talk about in terms of the overall loan growth. But that's really \u2013 those are really the categories that are shrinking. I mean, do you have a sense as to where those categories will level out? Bruce Thompson :  Well, if you start from a home equity perspective, I think that the repayment and run off of those is a god thing and not a bad thing. And so, you\u2019ll continue to see \u2013 I would expect over the next couple of years that the amortization of those is going to be greater than the new loans coming on the book. We would not expect though as you look at net interest income given the yields on those versus what you can do with other things that the run off of that book will have a negative impact from an overall net interest income perspective. And as it relates to the whole loans piece, that we have, I would expect that that over time that will continue to run down. We continue to look as we talked about before on the home loans business to put and to originate mortgages for customers where we want to hold those loans during the quarter, we put about $6 billion of home loans that were originated for our customers on our balance sheet. Roughly 75% to 80% of those would have been of the jumbo variety. But I think to be realistic over the next probably couple of years, you are likely to see a little bit more run-off of that then you\u2019ll see new loans coming on and we obviously have the decision at that point of do you want to reinvest those proceeds and other whole loans that you can buy out in the market or invest those in securities and I would say at this point with LCR as well as what we are focused on from a customer perspective, they are much more likely to be invested in securities than new whole loans that are not for our customers. Moshe Orenbuch \u2013 Credit Suisse :  Got it and secondly, the reserve build for legal, I guess, could you talk about how much you have in reserves in total? Or maybe address as to how you came up with that number? Given the fact that I think, if I'm reading the footnotes correctly, that your possible but not accrued losses kind of have stayed flat from the first quarter? Bruce Thompson :  Yes, couple things, the range of possible loss that you quoted of being flat from the first quarter to the second quarter relates to our representation and warranty reserves not our litigation RTL. So, you are correct that the rep and warrant piece was flat quarter-over-quarter. We do not update and provide a range of possible loss on litigation expense until we file the 10-Q. As it relates to overall litigation reserves, we do not put out an exact or a level of our litigation reserve, what I do think is notable and probably most relevant is the information that I gave you as it relates to the litigation reserve that\u2019s been built over the last two quarters that relates to legacy mortgage related matters and I think you can see and people are aware of what the most significance of those matters are. And obviously each quarter as it relates to the reserving, we go through each quarter and assess where we are and what we think is appropriate from a reserving perspective and we did that again in this quarter just like we do in any quarter. Moshe Orenbuch \u2013 Credit Suisse :  Okay, great and just a quick follow-up to the first one. You had mentioned kind of investing some of the run-off from the mortgages and home equity portfolio in securities. Is that in the context of keeping those balances kind of stable or would you actually increase that portfolio? Bruce Thompson :  Yes, the first goal is obviously, as we\u2019ve talked about it to find and invest in loans that are for our core customers across the platform and that\u2019s priority one to the extent that there is residual or excess which there has been given the deposit growth that we\u2019ve seen the money does gets invested and it\u2019s been invested primarily in the most recent several quarters in securities. I mentioned OCI risk, the notable thing is that if you look at the OCI risk that we have as a company, even though the securities book has increased significantly over the course of the last twelve months, the overall level of OCI risk based on the different metrics that we look at is not changed and that\u2019s the result of us shortening the portfolio investing in shorter duration treasury securities. Moshe Orenbuch \u2013 Credit Suisse :  Okay, thanks. Operator :  And we\u2019ll go next to Steven Chubak with Nomura. Please go ahead. Steven Chubak \u2013 Nomura Securities :  Hi, good morning. Bruce Thompson :  Good morning. Steven Chubak \u2013 Nomura Securities :  So the first question I have pertains to capital and RWA specifically. So over the last five quarters, we have actually seen the RWAs on a flat to upward trajectory; and then effectively the growth has mirrored the balance sheet growth that we've seen over that same period. And I just wanted to get a sense as to whether there were any additional mitigation levers that you guys could potentially pull, or whether those types of opportunities have been largely exhausted, and thus the growth going forward will likely continue to mirror the balance sheet? Bruce Thompson :  Yes, I think as it relates to the risk-weighted assets they can either bifurcate risk-weighted assets under Basel 3 standardized versus those under Basel 3 advance. As you look at the Basel 3 standardized ratios, the benefits that we have there tend to come from the roll-offs of the different consumer loan portfolios both in first mortgage as well as in home equity and we would expect as we talked about throughout the call that you will continue to see a run-off there and given that a lot of the stuff that\u2019s running off is higher loan to value than the new stuff that\u2019s coming on that there is incremental benefit there. So, if you look at over the last five quarters, I think the way that the standardized metric is set up, the standardized metric is going to tend to mere the overall loan growth that you have and I am just \u2013 as I mentioned going forward, on average it will probably be a little bit lower mix coming on than what rolls off. On the advanced approach at this point, as we look forward, there will continue to be opportunities and stuff that\u2019s advanced that tends to be heavier risk-weighted that rolls off between now and 2017, it\u2019s not going to be anywhere near material as what we\u2019ve seen and under the advanced approach, the recent increase as you\u2019ve seen has largely been attributable to operational risk as opposed to what we are seeing within the kind of the core loan categories. Steven Chubak \u2013 Nomura Securities :  Okay, thanks. Now, that's really helpful. And switching over to GWIM for a moment and actually taking a longer-term view on the earnings power within the segment, there is one area where we have struggled from a modeling perspective. It's trying to contemplate exactly how high the operating margin can get in a rising rate scenario, because the operating leverage improvement can be fairly dramatic. But presumably there is that peak margin level where competition is going to intensify to such a degree that effectively there's going to be no more room for improvement beyond, I don't know, let's call it 30%. I didn't know if that was something which you guys had evaluated at least in the context of a rising rate scenario. Bruce Thompson :  I think, you\u2019ve got one of the levers in the business that people often overlook is the lever towards rising rates, because in the business itself the amount of total deposits and loans are significant $250 of deposits and loans. And I think we said on the last call, and as said many times, we can see this margin moving towards 30% and that dynamic yield in that environment. But I think when you get to there, you start to top out a little bit if you just understand the broad base of revenue and the amount that goes through the grid and things like that that become a govern on what you can do beyond that. But as the mix of our business of wealth management with the private banking business and loans and deposits from a general client base and what\u2019s been there, that gets leveraged in the upside as you described. Steven Chubak \u2013 Nomura Securities :  Okay, great and one final one on credit. At your Analyst Day a number of years ago, you had given some guidance on through the cycle charge-off rates. But clearly since that update your loan mix has changed fairly dramatically and at the same time underwriting standards have tightened meaningfully. From what I recall, I believe the through-the-cycle charge-off rate at that time that was implied was somewhere in the neighborhood of 120 bps. And clearly it's going to be lower than that going forward, but I was hoping you could give us an update, maybe some updated guidance on where you think that through this cycle and net charge-off rate will likely end up? Brian Moynihan :  I think, if you look at the charge-offs, the key is that when you really think about the broad constitution of $1.3 if you remove the recoveries, you got to look at the card business and what changed since that time as we have changed our position the card business fairly dramatically with the sales from international portfolios and even how we\u2019ve approached the U.S. is based on the dynamics of the card business. The good news is the card business is starting to grow in terms of balances and going back to an earlier question we got rid of the non-core aspects and now you are seeing the core start to come through $1.1 to cards. People are using the cards more and the balance is growing. And so I think that if you just think about that, that number is going to be \u2013 is today and will be the dominant part of the charge-off questions and you should think that $100-ish billion and balances as you look forward you would expect that to grow but not continue to stop dramatically, it\u2019s not for us to change dramatically in terms of positioning our balance sheet because we need to keep that book balance because there is higher charge-offs and period of unemployment level. So, I\u2019d say, if you went back and look at that that is the biggest core adjustment between the two items and then, the counter to that is, if you look at the appendix page as you see the charge-offs on the mortgage business in the first mortgage business again recoveries, but if you look at home equity side. You still have a charge-off rate which based on the underwriting criteria the stuff going on will be much higher and so we had a couple $100 million before the charge-offs that you can see on page 21. So we\u2019d expect to see improvement in that from where we are, but I\u2019d say the card business is kind of about as good, is getting very strong. If you look at home equity you can reversal from the recoveries on the first mortgage loans. But it is a fundamentally different level because we mix the balance sheet differently on purpose. Steven Chubak \u2013 Nomura Securities :  Okay, that's great. Thank you for taking my questions. Operator :  And we\u2019ll go next to Paul Miller with FBR. Please go ahead. Paul Miller \u2013 FBR Capital Markets :  Yes, thank you very much. Going back to your LAS costs, excluding litigation, where you mentioned that it's probably \u2013 to get to that $1.1 billion target it\u2019s going to take another quarter or two. What should we be watching and how long do you think that LAS expenses are going to move to become non-material, I guess is another way to say it? Can you give us things, what we should be tracking? Bruce Thompson :  Sure. The first thing I want to be clear Paul that the \u2013 getting to the $1.1 billion has moved back \u2013 maybe moved back one quarter not two. Paul Miller \u2013 FBR Capital Markets :  I'm sorry. Bruce Thompson :  We are looking at one quarter. The second though that the biggest item that really relates to the trajectory of LAS expenses is your number of 60 plus day delinquent loans, because the cost to service that is many multiples what the cost of servicing a current loan is. So, as you go forward, we have full limitation of the national settlement effective September 30. That will be a big benchmark and then as you go beyond then, as we said, one to two quarter lag you will see expenses trend down as your number of sixty plus day delinquent loans trend down and as those trend down, you need less people as well as a variety of other expenses. So that\u2019s the key metric to watch. And as it relates to just how long that\u2019s going to continue, I would not expect that we get down to the level of what should be a recurring number of 60 plus day delinquents until probably the end of 2015 or the first part of 2016, so as it relates to continued expense leverage, we would expect to see upside in that business probably all the way through the end of 2016 as it relates to driving expense down. Brian Moynihan :  And Paul we\u2019ve got work to do in a sense if we go back I think as we look at, I think at the fourth quarter of 2012 it was about $3.1 billion, the fourth quarter of 2013 I think it was $2.1 billion Bruce, and then, we said 1.1 \u2013 originally said higher then we brought down the $1.1 billion announced. I think it is somewhere little higher than that but that\u2019s the broad move and the question is how do you keep going on that and that is really going to be as Bruce said a number of 60 plus delinquent loans, it\u2019s largely where these people. But we are also getting condition as we now got the place stable and that\u2019s behind us so we can start to invest in technology that will add a level of improvement that we haven\u2019t been able to invest in while we just had to get the work done. And so we expect the systems deployment in that business as we move into the middle of 2015 and to 2016 and we expect consolidations of physical plans and things like that which will add to the expense leverage but we haven\u2019t been able to do that as much yet just because of just the mass of the amount of the work that had to take place. So, there is still lot of work ahead of the team but if you put in the context the $2 billion, this first quarter and expense reduction across eight quarters that lot of work has been done too. Paul Miller \u2013 FBR Capital Markets :  And just a follow-up, you talked about you do have another MSR sale, I don't know how material that is. But right now there has not been a lot of transfer of MSRs due to various \u2013 well, Lawsky, up in New York, questioning a lot of the stuff that other companies are doing. Is that \u2013 can that interfere with the sale or you think you can sell the MSR without the headline risk of Lawsky? Bruce Thompson :  The MSR sales that I referenced that will happen in the second half of the year. In the context of what we\u2019ve done is relatively small. It\u2019s just that the delinquency content associated with that sale is high. So it\u2019s material from that perspective, but from an overall size perspective it\u2019s not material. Paul Miller \u2013 FBR Capital Markets :  Okay, guys. Thank you very much. Operator :  And we\u2019ll go next to Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead. Marty Mosby \u2013 Vining Sparks :  Thanks. I want to ask you a couple questions. First off, you've been harvesting about $400 million worth of gains out of the debt portfolio. Is that in the sense of trying to minimize your AOCI risk when rates do go up, as you're shortening the portfolio or just wanted to think about your strategy; because that's been a pretty consistent flow through over the last year? Bruce Thompson :  As we look at those gains, we are committed to not \u2013 as we continue to see liquidity build not taking incremental OCI risk as I referenced. And so over the last year, even as the securities portfolios has grown, we\u2019ve managed to keep the OCI risk from an absolute dollar perspective relatively flat and as you see markets move up and down, obviously selling longer duration securities as you growth in the securities portfolio as part of that strategy. Marty Mosby \u2013 Vining Sparks :  No I just want to make sure that the gains are just an outflow of that overall strategy that you had talked about. Bruce Thompson :  Yes, you are exactly correct. Marty Mosby \u2013 Vining Sparks :  Okay, when you look at the kind of the consumer and business bank, you have a considerable amount more in deposits than you really have in loans, which to me seems a little bit more skewed than what you would normally expect. How do you strategically think you can utilize that balance sheet funding over time or what are some of the initiatives that you are doing because you should be able to penetrate that customer base with more lending? Brian Moynihan :  That I think \u2013 yes, we should be able to penetrate on more lending. So, that if you look on page 17, you can see the \u2013 18 excuse me, you can see the growth in card originations, the growth in home equity originations, which go on a balance sheet as Bruce talked about early would put about, I\u2019d say half broadly stated of the originations and mortgages are going on the balance sheet. And in the business banking segment which is a small part of our commercial banking segment here to \u2013 $50 million on the revenue companies we are actually starting to see net loan growth the first time and a lot of times as it been up for non-core portfolios and so that\u2019s the core opportunity in the franchise as it continued to originate credit to the core customer base and there is lots of opportunities there, but you can see us making progress against each quarter. I think, on a broader context you got to think about these businesses and how they mix together. So in every company\u2019s retail business, it\u2019s an excess deposit generator just by the very nature of it and not only as it fund alone for the consumer customers but also provides the funding for the rest of the franchise. So, I think we have to keep that broader context and that\u2019s why we invest going to your first question on mortgages and securities to \u2013 lack of better term get the value out of those deposits for the shareholders. Bruce Thompson :  The other point that I just want to mention is that, historically, if you look at the front-end lending in consumer real estate that we\u2019ve done, from a segment perspective that that consumer real estate lending on a first mortgage basis, it shows up in the balance sheet and all other. So, you should \u2013 you can assume that those deposits that you see within page nine, a lot of the loans that they do for our customers are reflected in the all other segments. Marty Mosby \u2013 Vining Sparks :  And then in the mortgage segment, the CRES, you are still, if you take out the litigation, generating about a $700 million negative loss in the sense of your just pre-tax pre-prevision of between the revenues and expenses. You are talking about bringing down the Legacy Assets & Servicing expenses. But what is the timetable in your mind that would be reasonable to think of closing that $700 million gap? Bruce Thompson :  A couple of things, the first is, within consumer real estate services, if we look at the home loans business on the front-end, we talked about how we saw during the quarter that we increased both front-end originations as well as took down expense. So, Q1 to Q2 we saw about a $100 million improvement on the front-end of the business that\u2019s reflecting the consumer real estate services. And as it relates to the $700 million number that you quoted, we obviously, relative to the guidance have $300 million of expense to get out of that business over the next 90 days and then as we\u2019ve talked about earlier on the call, we\u2019ve got work to do to continue to drive that down significantly in both 2015 and the first part of 2016 and that\u2019s clearly one of the highest priorities we have within the company. Marty Mosby \u2013 Vining Sparks :  And just lastly, and thanks for letting me ask you a few questions. As if you are looking at valuation of your servicing portfolio, it dropped off to 82 basis points this quarter, which seems relatively low as the duration of that portfolio is extending. I know interest rates came back. So the models force you to write it back down. But when you're looking at the prepayment speeds and the refinancing behavior, it seems like eventually that there is some value as that portfolio lasts a lot longer than the model assumes at this point. Bruce Thompson :  Well, I think your point, the value and the fact that on a basis point basis the came down was reflective of the lower rates that we saw at the end of the second quarter relative to the end of the first quarter and you are right, at a point in time when rates start to move out, you would expect that MSR to extend and for there to be value there, but we do not \u2013 I want to emphasize that we look to manage the MSR risk as part of the overall strategy and are mangling that to have it be a plat book. Marty Mosby \u2013 Vining Sparks :  While from an interest rate standpoint I understand that this seems like the models have assumed a lot faster prepayments than we\u2019ve really actually experience, which eventually has to true up? Brian Moynihan :  At the end of the day it comes down to what the customer does here, exactly right. Marty Mosby \u2013 Vining Sparks :  All right, thanks. Operator :  And we\u2019ll go next to Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Matt Burnell \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities :  The questions have been asked and answered. Thanks very much. Brian Moynihan :  Thanks, Matt. Operator :  And we\u2019ll go next to Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead. Mike Mayo \u2013 CLSA:  Hi, a couple follow-ups. First on the deposit betas, I appreciate you giving us the color, for every 100 basis point increase it would help by $3.4 billion. You describe the deposit base. But what is the actual deposit beta that you use to come up with the $3.4 billion benefit? Bruce Thompson :  We did not quote, Mike, the actual deposit data. We obviously go back and look at historical data. Our assumption is as it relates to pass through rates as far as how much of the first 100 basis points that has to get passes along, we are in the 40% area with respect to that. Mike Mayo \u2013 CLSA:  Okay, 40% for the first 100? Bruce Thompson :  Correct. Mike Mayo \u2013 CLSA:  All right. So I think that's in the ballpark of one of your large peers, but below some others. And is the reason that would be below others just because it's a lot of branch-based deposits? Bruce Thompson :  You are exactly correct and if we go back and look at what it\u2019s been throughout time, at points where arguably we don\u2019t have the competitive position now, we look at a lot of historical data to come up with that number. Mike Mayo \u2013 CLSA:  As it relates to expenses, you've achieved 90% of the $8 billion New BAC savings. I see the branches are 5023 and I think you said you wanted to be around 5,000 branches. And so if I heard you right, I think you're going from a period of rightsizing to growth. Is that a fair characterization? Brian Moynihan :  Yes, we\u2019ve been growing underlying activity. If you look at some statistics in the back things were up Mike, but you are right, the \u2013 if you go back a couple years ago we started New BAC we were running $59 billion of core expenses, now run at $13 billion. And so we are largely getting there and then question then is now how do you hold at there in the economic and environment which is lower growth and traditionally expected in the United States and that\u2019s been \u2013 this vigilance on our part. But during the whole time period we\u2019ve invested literally thousands and thousands of people into the sales side and start to try that growth and we\u2019ll continue to do that. The question is how do you balance that investment grade. Bruce Thompson :  And I\u2019d just, Mike, before \u2013 I assume, the \u2013 achieving the balance of the $2 billion in quarterly New BAC savings in the fourth quarter is not dependent on future branch sales. So I just want to make sure that there is not an assumed linkage there. Mike Mayo \u2013 CLSA:  And are you reallocating some of the people assigned to New BAC to other areas? It seems like you could dismantle that project group, so to speak? Brian Moynihan :  It\u2019s not a big project, I mean, this is done by the people run the businesses, with just committed plans that we did this wasn\u2019t \u2013 it\u2019s not a huge project group to actually accomplish. It\u2019s done by who have to run each business, each function. Mike Mayo \u2013 CLSA:  Okay as it relates to loan pay-downs, Bruce, you mentioned that some bank loans declined as customers went to the capital markets. In a way, a type of disintermediation from the bank. But can you elaborate on that? Are you still seeing that this quarter? Do you think that was a one-off event or is that something we should watch out for? Bruce Thompson :  Our sense is from what we saw during the quarter, it was more a one-off event. There were a couple of loans that were for acquisition-related purposes that people then went out and refinanced. So that was just a little bit of an anomaly that we saw in the second quarter and if you look at just the attractiveness that the capital markets have been, you would expect that to largely be over. But every now and then when you deal with large multinational companies where some of the loan holds are little bit higher. You can have those one-time events where that happens and we had a little bit of that in the second quarter. It\u2019s not something we would expect to recur. Mike Mayo \u2013 CLSA:  What I'm getting to is, do you guys think this is an inflection point for loan growth? I can find one of your large peers who implied that it is; and I can find a large regional bank who says it's not. Where do you fall out on the spectrum? You said, Brian that middle-market utilization was up ever so slightly, can you just give us that utilization number and where you stand? Brian Moynihan :  Bruce, gave it early, but I have to do again. Bruce Thompson : Sure. The middle market utilization rate was kind of 37 plus percent at the end of the first quarter and was up about almost 1% to mid 38%, which I don\u2019t think in and of itself is not material, but it does seem that that people are a little bit more willing to access the revolving credits. At the same time practically speaking, you are not going to tend to see loan growth that\u2019s dramatically higher than the rate at which the overall economy is growing. So, we clearly, as Brian Alluded to in his opening comments, we did see an economy that improved in the second quarter relative to the first quarter and on the commercial side, our loan growth is going to tend to mere or be a little bit above what we seen in the macro economy. Mike Mayo \u2013 CLSA:  So do you think this is an inflection point for loan growth? Or is that an answer you would rather not delve into? Brian Moynihan :  We\u2019ve seen \u2013 we are seeing signs of improvement, I am not sure I\u2019d go as far as saying it\u2019s an inflection point. Mike Mayo \u2013 CLSA:  Okay, at the Annual Meeting, the clock ran out on me before I could ask one question, a very simple, what are your financial targets with and without higher interest rates? Brian Moynihan :  We\u2019ve been pretty consistent if we go back, I believe Mike \u2013 the third and fourth quarter earnings call, that as we look out to and as we look at and embed in our models of 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve that we are looking at that point with a tangible common equity ratio of 7% and return on asset of 1% to be at a 14% return on tangible common equity. As you get into the \u2013 you don\u2019t see that rate environment until 2016 and if you look at those metrics and back out what we\u2019ve said a 100 basis points is worth to us on a parallel shift, you get a sense for what we need to get to ex the 100 basis point move. Mike Mayo \u2013 CLSA:  I'm sorry. So without the 100 basis point shift, the target for ROA and ROTCE is what? Brian Moynihan :  That\u2019s going to be roughly $3.3 billion or $3.4 billion pre-tax and at $0.63 it\u2019s $2 billion less which on roughly $140 billion on tangible common equity is going to be about 20 basis points less on assets at that point. Mike Mayo \u2013 CLSA:  Okay. And then last question, as it relates to Citigroup's settlement with the DOJ for MBS securitizations and CDOs, you had quite a bit more in MBS securitizations and CDO structuring; and so how can we think about this number and the amount of reserves that you have, I read one press article that you were willing to offer $12 billion and the DOJ wanted $17 billion. I know you can't go into too much detail on this. But can you just give us a framework for how you view resolving this? I mean, on the one hand you could argue maybe you shouldn't pay hardly anything because you bought a lot of these entities that created these deals and you are just punishing the new shareholders. And on the other hand, if you say that you had ten times the level of some of this MBS activity, it could be a huge number. So how should we think about that? Brian Moynihan :  As we said, Mike, I think, we can\u2019t discuss that and you get a rendition of all the different criteria that people written about. I think this quarter we are able to put away the AIG case, which if you remember was back in 2011 lot of the people said it was worth a lot more money for $650 million. So we will continue to figure out where we get behind us a reasonable cost for our shareholders. We just can\u2019t talk about details on this. Mike Mayo \u2013 CLSA:  All right, well, good job with the AIG. I was one of those people who thought it was going to be more, and it wasn't. But that's fine. I will take any guidance I can get on the legal costs ahead. Thanks a lot. Bruce Thompson :  Okay, thank you. Operator :  And we\u2019ll take our last question from David Hilder with Drexel Hamilton, please go ahead. David Hilder \u2013 Drexel Hamilton :  Thanks. Most of my questions have been answered. Just on the AIG settlement, I actually thought AIG was the only remaining objector, are there others? Bruce Thompson :  There are several other objectors that had not been as vocal and as I said, we\u2019ll have to see where it goes with that dropping out. David Hilder \u2013 Drexel Hamilton :  And AIG has agreed to dismiss all its claims or its objections, I should say? Okay, great. Brian Moynihan :  That\u2019s correct, it\u2019s part of the settlement agreement. David Hilder \u2013 Drexel Hamilton :  Great. Thanks very much. Brian Moynihan :  Great, super. Well, I think we are through all the questions. So thanks a lot for joining us and we look forward to talking next quarter. Bruce Thompson :  Thank you. Operator :  This does conclude today\u2019s conference. You may now disconnect and have a wonderful day.",

(Operator Instructions). Please note this call is being recorded and I will be standing by should you need any assistance. It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Mr. Lee McEntire. Please go ahead, sir. Lee McEntire : Good morning. Thanks everybody on the phone as well as the webcast for joining us this morning for our third quarter results. Hopefully you\u2019ve had a chance to review the earnings release documents available on our website. Before I turn the call over to Brian and Bruce, let me just remind you, we may make some forward-looking statements today. For further information on those, please refer to either our earnings release documents, our website or our other SEC filings. So with that, let me turn it over to Brian Moynihan, our CEO for some opening comments before Bruce goes through the details. Brian Moynihan : Thanks, Lee, and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us to review our third quarter results. As you know, our bottom-line results were heavily impacted by previously announced settlement with Department of Justice. But given that, I\u2019m still encouraged by what we accomplished this quarter. Our business has generated enough earnings to absorb the $5.3 billion charge and still reported positive net income before preferred dividends. Now, the themes that we see are consistent with the past several quarters. You can see in our numbers a prudent balance sheet management; you can see in the numbers good core expense control; you can see in the numbers continued credit improvement and you can see in the numbers solid business activity. Before Bruce takes you through the detail of the quarter, I thought I\u2019d focus quickly on the profitability of our business segments and some of the key statistics that give rise thereto. If you look, we\u2019ve included in the appendix the materials on pages 18 and 20 some information about net income, PPNR and business statistics. So you step back and look, you can see from our release, the company reported $2.9 billion in year-to-date pretax net income that includes and overcomes 15.6 billion in pretax litigation costs to resolve primarily legacy mortgage issues. Now we\u2019re not suggesting that we want to incur litigation cost going forward but what this demonstrates is how much progress we\u2019ve made behind the noise of significant legal settlements. So you step back and think about the businesses, you can see on appendix slide 18 a graphic showing year-to-date net income comparative performance by the businesses. Let\u2019s first focus on our Consumer and Business Banking segment. Year-to-date net income was $5.3 billion in 2014. That compares to $4.6 billion after tax in 2013. The return on average allocated capital in Consumer & Business Banking was 24%. It is our largest business and it\u2019s had a good year. Our Global Wealth and Investment Management business had net income of year-to-date of $2.3 billion in 2014 that\u2019s up 3% from 2013. Now this business, our GWIM business has a pretax margin of 26% and has returns on allocated capital of 25%. As we move to our Global Banking business, that\u2019s the business provides lending, treasury services, investment banking activities to middle markets and large corporate clients around the world. That business earned $4 billion after tax so far this year, up 8% from 2013 and generated returns on allocated capital of 17%. Those three businesses together have great annuity streams and hold us in good state as we look forward. Our Global Markets business which obviously is more affected by what\u2019s going on in the market on the given quarter has earned $2.9 billion after tax this year and for the first nine months versus $2.7 billion in 2013 when you adjust for DVA and in 2013 you exclude the UK tax changes. So in total, these four businesses generated $14.5 billion net income after-tax for the first nine months of 2014. That $14.5 billion is up 10% from last year. You can look on slide 19 and you can see on a pretax pre-provision basis which some of you also focus on, we are 4% year-over-year. And you can see on pages 20 and 21 the business statistics over the last couple of years which give rise to these results. We\u2019ve made real progress in the four businesses and we continue to work on the Consumer Real Estate segment and losses therein. But that real progress shows in the operating leverage profitability of these businesses and we expect that momentum to continue as we move the other side of the mortgage issues. With that, I'll turn it over to Bruce. Bruce Thompson : Thanks Brian and good morning everyone. This quarter does reflect what we believe is very solid execution and a lot of what we\u2019ve been consistently talking with all of you about. We maintained a strong balance sheet as a foundation to operate from. We continued to rationalize our balance sheet for liquidity, profitability as well as evolving regulatory changes. Our revenue has shown relative stability and our non-litigation expenses continue to be reduced. Charge-offs have continued to come down, and we resolved significant legacy mortgage exposures during the quarter. Let's start on slide two and go through the details. We recorded a $168 million of earnings in the third quarter and after preferred dividends that resulted in a loss of a penny per share. Earnings included the $5.3 billion pretax income -- or pretax impact, excuse me of the settlement with the Department of Justice in various state attorneys general that we announced in August. On an EPS basis, the impact was $0.43 a share, as a portion this charge was not tax deductable. As you can see on the right hand side of slide two, the $5.3 billion impact was split between $4.9 billion in litigation expense and $400 million in provision expense that relate to additional reserves that are associated with a consumer relief portion of this settlement. Revenue during the quarter on an FTE basis was $21.4 billion versus $21.7 billion in the year ago quarter. If we exclude the DVA impact from both periods as well as the $1.2 billion of equity investment income that we recorded during the third quarter of \u201813 that was driven by gains from our CCB investment, adjusted revenue of $21.2 billion was up slightly from the third quarter of 2013. On a segment view, revenue was stable to modestly up in four of our five businesses from last year with CRES being the exception. Relative to the second quarter of 2014, revenue was 3% lower driven by the lack of equity investment gains, seasonally lower investment banking fees and lower mortgage banking revenue. Total non-interest expense was $19.7 billion which included $5.6 billion in total litigation expense. We back out litigation expense; compared to the second quarter of 2014, expenses declined roughly $400 million from both our New BAC and our ALS cost initiatives as well as lower revenue related incentives. On the same basis, looking back to the third quarter of 2013, expenses improved by $1.1 billion or 7% which were driven by reduced LAS costs and to a lesser degree our New BAC cost savings. Provision for credit losses during the quarter was $636 million and included $400 million, as I mentioned for the DoJ Settlement, while our net charge-offs were $1 billion. Our results during the quarter did benefit from roughly $200 million in DVA or about a penny per share as our debt spread widened during the end of the quarter. There was also approximately $0.04 of benefit to earnings that relate to certain discrete tax items. Lastly, the quarter also benefited by about a penny as our weighted average share count excluded the impact of diluted shares given the financial performance. On slide three, we show you all the usual balance sheet highlights that we do each quarter but we did want to focus you specifically on our efforts to rationalize the balance sheet as our actions led to a $47 billion decrease from the second quarter of 2014. We took prudent actions to increase liquidity as well as to reduce both credit and market risk. We shifted the mix of some of our discretionary assets out of less liquid loans into more liquid debt securities. For example, we converted 6.5 billion of residential mortgage loans that benefited from standby insurance agreements into agency securities. We also sold $2.5 billion of non-performing and delinquent loans during the quarter and had $4 billion of net pay downs in our legacy consumer real estate loans. We reduced our global markets balance sheet and associated funding by $11.7 billion from the second quarter of \u201814 and that included low margin prime brokerage loans of approximately $3.3 billion. Our decline in quarter end deposits was primarily driven by optimization efforts that included the reduction of approximately 15 billion of deposits that had little to no benefit to our LCR ratio. From a capital perspective, I'll remind you that we did issue 3.1 billion of preferred stock during the quarter that improved our Basel III Tier 1 regulatory capital ratio. And lastly as a reminder, we increased our quarterly common dividend to $0.05 a share during the quarter. We move to slide four where we show our capital ratios under Basel III. Under the transition rules, our CET1 ratio was stable at 12%. If we look at our Basel III regulatory capital ratios on a fully phased-in basis, you can see CET1 capital declined 1.6 billion that was driven by a $1 billion decline in OCI. Our operational risk weighted assets did increase that negatively impacted our advanced levels but not the standard levels. Other RWA balance sheet improvements benefited both approaches and that partially offset the increase in RWA under the advanced approach. If we look at the ratios under the standardized approach, CET1 improved slightly to 9.6% during the third quarter of \u201814 and under the advanced approach, the CET1 ratio was also at 9.6%, both well above our 8.5% 2019 proposed minimum requirements. If you look at our operational risk, risk weighted assets under the advanced approach; they now represent approximately 30% of our overall risk weighted assets. We move to supplementary leverage. This is the first quarter that we've actually disclosed the actual ratios from a supplementary leverage perspective. The bank holding company during the third quarter was at 5.5%. And if we look at our primary banking subsidiary BANA, its ratio was 6.8% which is pro forma for September 30th as we merged FIA, our card services unit into BANA on October 1st. We\u2019re obviously very pleased with the capital and supplementary leverage ratios in the context of the resolution of the DoJ matter during the quarter. We turn to slide five, feel very good about the work that the funding team did during the quarter. In addition to the $3.1 million of preferred stock issuance, we issued 3 billion of Tier 2 subordinated debt, which also adds to our total capital metrics. Lastly, we issued $4.5 billion of straight debt at the parent. Our goal is not only to build the Basel III non-CET1 component of the capital stack that we thought or levels that were appropriate, but also to build liquidity in advance of the payments that we\u2019ll make during the month of October for the DoJ and state AG settlement. Total long-term debt for the quarter ended at $250 billion, which was down $7 billion from the end of the second quarter 2014. We look at the cost of our debt; our long-term debt yields improved 10 basis points from the second quarter of \u201814 due primarily to maturities of higher yielding debt as well as issuances at more favorable levels. Global access liquidity sources remained very strong at 429 billion and our time to required funding was stable at 38 months. We turn to slide six; net interest income on a reported FTE basis was 10.4 billion, up from the second quarter of \u201814 as we had a less negative impact from market related adjustments and that was coupled with modest improvement in our adjusted net interest income. The market related adjustments during the quarter were a negative $55 million in the third quarter of \u201814 that compares to a negative $175 million in the second quarter of \u201814. Net interest income of $10.5 billion excluding the market related adjustment, improved modestly as lower long-term debt balances and yield as well as an extra day of interest accruals were partially offset by lower loan balances as well as lower loan yields. The net interest yield improved 4 basis points on an adjusted basis and 7 basis points on an actual basis. We continue to remain positioned to benefit as interest rates move higher, particularly from the short end of the curve. Since we\u2019re largely done at this point with our debt footprint reductions, the direction as well as the trajectory of our net interest income and net interest yield will be more dependent on rates as well as balance sheet movements going forward. And given the volatility of the rates, should the opportunity present itself, we could decide to take actions to reduce OCI risk in preparation for what we will be in an eventual rising rate environment. Those actions could have a relatively small near term impact to net interest income but reduced our duration risk as well as to provide additional liquidity to reinvest in a higher rate environment. Non-interest expense on slide seven was $19.7 billion in the third quarter of \u201814 and included $5.6 billion of litigation expense. As I previously mentioned, $4.9 million of the expense related to the DoJ Settlement while the remainder was associated with the number of smaller pre-existing cases, one of which caused us to book approximately $200 million in our Global Markets business. We exclude litigation; total expenses were $14.2 billion this quarter which declined $400 million from the second quarter of 2014 on both, our New BAC as well as our LAS initiatives as well as lower revenue related incentive cost. Compared to the third quarter of \u201813, expenses are $1.1 billion lower, driven by LAS cost savings. Our legacy assets and servicing cost once again ex-litigation reduced by approximately a $100 million in the quarter and remained on track to hit $1.1 billion in the first quarter of 2015. In the third quarter, we\u2019ve now reached our new BAC savings initiatives with the targeted goal of $2 billion a quarter or $8 billion on an annualized basis. So, as we move forward, we believe that expenses apart from litigation as well as the continued reductions in legacy assets and servicing expenses should move more directionally with the revenue streams that we see in the businesses. Asset quality on slide eight, you can see credit quality continued to improve. Net charge-offs declined slightly from the second quarter of \u201814 to $1 million or a 46 basis-point net loss ratio, a new decade low. NPL sales which I mentioned produced modest recovery in both the second quarter of \u201814 as well as the third quarter of \u201814. And if we normalize for those benefits, net charge-offs would have been $1.3 billion in the second quarter of '14 and $1.2 billion in the third quarter of '14 with the third quarter being about 8% lower. Delinquencies, a leading indicator of net charge-offs remained very low. Our third quarter provision expense was 636 million and we released 407 million of reserves, given the continued pace of asset quality improvement. If we exclude the reserve that was associated with the DOJ Settlement, we released 807 million from our reserves. Let's now focus on the businesses, starting on slide nine with Consumer & Business Banking. Results again this quarter showed year-over-year improvement as our net income grew 4% to 1.9 billion and increased 3% from the second quarter of 2014. This business generated 25% return on allocated capital during the third quarter. Revenue was relatively stable at 7.5 billion compared to the third quarter of '13 and up from the second quarter of '14, led by higher card income and service charges for both comparative periods. As you can see on the slide, Q3 provision expense was lower than the third quarter of \u201813 as net charge-offs improved and we also released less reserves. Expenses of 4 billion were stable compared to both periods as the benefits from our net book delivery optimization were offset by investments that we made in our special sales force. With regard to the special sales force, over the course of the last year, we've added nearly 500 financial solutions advisors and small business bankers. Growth in mobile as well as other self-service customer touch points has allowed us to continue to reduce our banking centers where we went below 5,000 units during the quarter, while at the same time, our customer satisfaction scores continued to improve and customer activity continues to build. We look at customer activity during the quarter. We had good deposit growth and our rates paid remained very low. We experienced modest improvement in average loans on a linked quarter basis driven by activities that we saw within the U.S. consumer credit card business. Brokerage assets were up 21% year-over-year as we benefited from both improved account flows and market valuation. Our mobile banking customers reached over 16 million during the quarter and 11% of all of our customer deposit transactions are now done through mobile devices. Card issuance remained strong at 1.2 million new accounts in the third quarter of \u201814 with 64% of those cards going to existing customers of our company. And lastly, credit quality continued to improve as our U.S. credit card loss rate fell below 3% and where we continue to see north of a 9% risk adjusted margin. If we moved to consumer real estate services; as I mentioned, the loss in the quarter was driven by the DOJ settlement, which impacted expense, provision, as well as income tax. Revenue was down about $300 million from the second quarter of 2014. The servicing income component of revenue was driven by an approximate $100 million charge to adjust our MSR for cost of service assumptions. And a smaller amount in our level of servicing assets did decline. Our production revenue decline was driven by approximate $80 million increase in rep and warrant expense. First mortgage retail origination of $11.7 billion, were up 6% from the second quarter of 2014. If we look at the pipeline at the end of the quarter, our first-lien origination pipeline was down 12% from the second quarter of 2014. On the home equity front, we continue to see very good demand where originations during the quarter were $3.2 million, which were up nicely on both the linked quarter and a year-over-year basis. Expenses once again included $5.3 billion of litigation costs during the quarter versus $3.8 billion in the second quarter of 2014. If we exclude that $1.5 billion increase in litigation cost, expenses declined a $117 million. Our LAS expense for the quarter was just over $1.3 billion and once again remains on track to hit $1.1 billion in the first quarter of 2015. Our number of 60 plus day delinquent loans of $221,000 that are serviced by LAS dropped $42,000 or 16% from the end of the second quarter of \u201814. In addition, we continue to reduce our production staffing levels in line with the market opportunity as we continue to lower our fulfillment cost. On slide 11, global wealth and investment management delivered another strong quarter, where we saw both record revenues, as well as record earnings. Pre-tax margins remained strong, north of 25% for the 7th consecutive quarter. Record asset management fees drove revenue higher, but were offset by some softness in transactional activity, although I do want to mention that we did see transactional activity pickup during the month of September. Net income of $830 million was up 12% on a linked quarter basis as the business continues to focus on operating leverage and drop the revenue growth to the bottom-line. We increased the number of financial advisors and year-to-date the retention of our more experienced advisors remains at record levels. Client balances were nearly $2.5 trillion with negative market valuation mostly offset by positive flows that we saw during the quarter. Long-term AUM flows were $11.2 billion during the quarter, the 21st consecutive quarter of positive flows. Ending client loan balances also increased to a record level from the second quarter of \u201814 as we see good activity in both securities-based and residential mortgage lending. And return on allocated capital in this segment was 27% during the quarter. If you turn to slide 12, global banking earnings were $1.4 billion, which is up 24% from the third quarter of \u201813 on both on lower credit cost and to a lesser degree higher revenue. Compared to the second quarter of \u201814, earnings were up on lower credit costs, which were slightly offset by seasonally lower investment banking fees. Return on allocated capital during the quarter was strong at 18%. Within the revenue line item, investment banking fees for the company this quarter were $1.4 billion, which is up 4% from the year ago quarter, but down seasonally from the second quarter of 2014. Our overall investment banking pipeline does remained very strong, but I do want to note that our fourth quarter of \u201813 was a record quarter from an investment banking fee perspective. Provision during the quarter was a slight benefit, which reflected continued low loss rates and a small reserve release. If we look at the balance sheet, average loans were $267 billion, which is up 3% compared to the year ago period, but which has slowed over the past couple of quarters as we continue to focus on client profitability. We've also seen some significant prepayments from some of our larger corporate banking clients during the last couple of quarters. Although our average deposits during the quarter did increase, our end of period balances declined. And that's due as I mentioned earlier, that we intentionally managed down certain deposits which have a little LCR benefit. If we move to Global Markets on slide 13, we earned $769 million during the third quarter of 2014. To put the third quarter of \u201814 on a like basis to the third quarter of \u201813, you should exclude a $1.1 billion impact from the UK tax rate change that we saw in the third quarter of \u201813, as well as the impact of DVA for both periods. Once again DVA this quarter was a benefit of $205 million versus a decrement of $444 million last year. If we make those adjustments, we saw very strong growth in earnings of 21% on a year-over-year basis. Earnings are down from the second quarter of \u201814 as a result of the typical seasonal declines in sales and trading, as well as higher litigation expense during the third quarter of \u201814 within this segment. If we back out DVA, revenue is up 7% from the year ago period driven by strong sales and trading results. We're pleased to report both FICC and equity sales and trading revenues were up versus the year ago period. FICC revenues were up 11%. The improvement was driven by results and currencies given the increased volatility that we saw during the month of September, as well as improved performance in both our mortgages and our commodities areas. Equity sales and trading was up as well, up 6% from the third quarter of \u201813 driven by a higher client financing revenues. On the expense front, they were up 2% year-over-year driven by higher revenue-related incentives. Relative to the second quarter, expenses were up $70 million from the second quarter due to higher litigation expense. If we back out the $200 million litigation expense during the quarter, expenses declined by about $130 million in line with the lower revenue levels on a linked quarter basis. Average trading-related assets were down about $13 billion from the second quarter of \u201814 and our overall bar remains very low. Return on allocated capital during the quarter was 9%. On slide 14, we show all other. Our non-interest revenue during the quarter was down on a year-over-year basis as we had $1.1 billion of equity investment gains in the third quarter of \u201813 and during the third quarter of \u201814, we had a $300 million charge for UK payment protection insurance. Expenses on a year-over-year basis are down about $400 million due to lower litigation expense and all other, as well as lower personnel costs. Income tax expense is included within all other is the benefit related to discrete items that I mentioned earlier are largely reflected in this segment. As we look at the fourth quarter of this year, we'd expect the tax rate to be roughly 31%, absent any unusual items during the quarter. So before we open it up for questions, I'd like to summarize the quarter. We feel we made once again very good progress during the quarter. We saw good business activity across the customer footprint. This led to year-over-year earnings improvements in four out of the five businesses. And then in our mortgage business, we're taking cost out of the legacy assets and servicing side and have taken cost out of the fulfillment side as well. We generated enough earnings during the quarter from the businesses to offset a significant charge to settle our RMBS issues with the DOJ and RMBS working group. And at the same time maintain a very strong capital position. Asset quality continued its trend of improvement. And we did take some delivered balance sheet actions to improve liquidity, manage OCI risk and reduce both credit and market risk. And we'll go ahead now and open it up for questions. Operator : (Operator Instructions). We'll go first to Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley : Hi, thanks very much. Good morning. Brian Moynihan : Good morning. Bruce Thompson : Good morning Betsy. Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley : So just wanted to touch on a couple of things that you mentioned during your prepared remarks here; one is on the NII actions that you were talking about you might take with the securities portfolio as a way to protect OCI. But it might have a hit on the top-line when you do that. Could you just talk through what kind of size you're thinking about and what the triggers for that action might be? Bruce Thompson : Sure. A couple of things, Betsy, I think the first thing is if you look at the balance sheet from the second quarter to the third quarter and you look at the securities portfolio you can see that group see the entire increase in the securities portfolio related to treasury securities that tend to have a maturity in the 4 to 5 year life perspective as opposed to longer dated agencies securities. The second thing that I mentioned is just in references what we would look to do with respect to our buy ticket during the fourth quarter. And I think at this point we\u2019re being very cautious looking at that buy ticket given the overall rate environment that we see that\u2019s 30 to 35 basis points lower than what we saw during the second quarter of 2014. And there is also a little bit of relative spot risk that you have as we look out. And I\u2019d say if we aggregate those two items and put it in a context of NII risk for the quarter, those two items could be roughly a $100 million of risk relative to what we saw during the second quarter, excuse me during the third quarter. Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley : Okay. And then obviously a question that a lot of people have is the current rate environment and what that impact is. So this is in addition to the typical negative impact on NII from the long end of the curve, I would assume? Bruce Thompson : The $100 million risk that I referenced is relative to the actual net interest income in the third quarter once we back out for market related items. Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley : Got it, got it. Okay. And then the other comment was on expenses where you indicated that you are obviously done with New BAC, which is fantastic and LAS is on track. So outside of the LAS expense reductions, more directionally expenses would move in line with revenue. Could you give us a sense as to what you think you could do on expenses in the event that the long end of the curve stays where it is right now, hovering at like $2.01? Bruce Thompson : Sure. And I think that there is negative standpoint too Betsy if you look out what we\u2019ve done if you look at the number of FTEs that we have which tends to drive a lot of the expense were down 7% year-over-year and down 2% on a linked quarter basis. And you see the flow through of those benefits through a number of line items. The most important things to look at is if you go to our supplemental materials and flip to page four, we show you 9 different expense items. And if you look at those line items and exclude the other category, which include litigation expense, all these lines items are down both on a linked quarter and a year-over-year basis. So as we continue to be efficient and continue to manage down overall headcount as a result of the various programs we've talked about, as well as just generally, you continue to see grind down expenses across all categories across the company. Brian Moynihan : And Betsy just to put in a broader perspective, how would you manage the company if the low rate environment continues is a lot like we've been managing and now continuing to be careful in every expense item, every headcount, but at the same time, investing in the business. And so if you think over the last year we've added small business bankers and financial service advisors the people work in the branches for Merrill Lynch and the Merrill Lynch teams. We've added sales mortgage officers in the retail segment, while we reduced the overall numbers. And so we've been able to accomplish the reduction expenses, but at the same time we're making the investments $3.5 billion in technology last year and probably 3.3 or so this year. So we'll continue to make those investments. So that means that the new BAC implement helps offset any kinds or sort of inflationary growth you get in and on top of that we continue to work on initiatives, continue to simplify the company and eliminate non-core products et cetera to continue to keep the expenses where they are. Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley : So just to rephrase, you still have expense reduction coming through from the work that you've done so far; you're just not going to name it something new? Bruce Thompson : No, we were just going to -- we were just doing a daily work that we need to do. And remember we're offsetting all the inflation and healthcare costs and wages and everything that goes on in normal days, but we even made the raw reduction and talk about now this business is usual good work. Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley : Okay, super. Thank you. Operator : And we'll go next to Glenn Schorr with ISI. Please go ahead. Glenn Schorr - ISI: Hi, thanks very much. On slide 8 is this tiny uptick in consumer 30 day past due. It's a small number, but it's the first time I've seen it go up in a long time. Credit outlook is great. Just curious if that denotes like a bottoming and what you're seeing. And then in conjunction with that, how you feel about your -- what appears to be very large loan allowance as a percentage of charge-offs? Bruce Thompson : Sure. Now we went back and notice the same thing Glenn, there are few item that were 10s, 20s and 30s that rounded, but as we go out and look at as we\u2019ve freshened up and look forward I would say that the forward look on credit as we look forward relative to when we looked at it last quarter, we do continue to see continued improvement, albeit at a slower pace from a charge-off perspective once you adjust for the non-performing loan sales. Glenn Schorr - ISI: That's good; that's comforting. You mentioned the $3 billion of sub debt that you issued during the quarter. Just curious if there is any thought process of is that getting ahead of OLA and do you feel that there is going to be a sub debt component? Is that just you being cautious and having some diversification in the debt structure? Bruce Thompson : I think as we look out and as you look to fill up the various non-CET1 bucket, you can see that we obviously had the Buffet Series T in May and we've issued about $4.6 billion to get over largely filled up on the preferred bucket and the sub debt issue of $3 billion was relative to approximately $5 billion to fill up that bucket from an overall capital perspective. And at this point I would say from an OLA perspective, we continue to read what you do. We feel like we've been very prudent in building up this significant debt stack at the parent. And we'll just have to see where the regulation goes from here and we're obviously waiting to see exactly what that is. Glenn Schorr - ISI: Okay, last one. On mortgage, just curious what percentage of current originations you're keeping on balance sheet and then related part two would be how much is the unfinished question around repurchase risk constraining any mortgage lending or is it really still a function of demand at this point? Bruce Thompson : The first as it relates to the balance sheet, I believe it was roughly two-thirds of the production from a first-lien perspective would have gone on the balance sheet during the quarter. Brian Moynihan : In terms of just origination quality, we continue to focus as we have quite a long time here on originating high quality prime mortgages, while still facilitating our duties to get customers credit for home purchases. The originations continue to rise. The purchase component obviously is rising too. So we feel good about where we are and you can see that new purchase requests from the agencies have come down dramatically. So we are not going to change the course, because at the end of the day, because we feel good about the credit quality we've taken. We're taking on using for ourselves and for investor. Glenn Schorr - ISI: Okay. Thanks both. Bruce Thompson : Thank you. Operator : And we'll go next to Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead. Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research : Hey, good morning. Brian Moynihan : Good morning. Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research : Two questions; first on governance, can you just kind of talk through the reasoning on the Board's perspective to kind of change the chairmanship and with a lead director how you think that dynamic may change, good or bad? And I guess secondly is this a vote of confidence in you, Brian, in terms of the leadership and current strategy? Brian Moynihan : We have a strong Board team with various people of various skills and background and that diversity really helps us. And so I think the Board\u2019s decision that we put out few weeks ago and announcements made, this is continued great governance can we make commitment to good governance, Jack Bovender new director takes over from Chad Holliday, who served as Chair for about 4.5 years and did great job for us and the Board is very committed to continue to have the strong governance especially in the high expectations from the regulators and enhanced supervisor prudential standards from the Fed. And so we feel good about the governance, but it\u2019s the team effort and then how the Board works together. And I think your points Chad maybe now in the announcement or that the Board feels very good about the option for the management team and this is part of their progression in that regard. Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research : And does the Fed take part in reviewing this decision in anyway? Brian Moynihan : It\u2019s the Board\u2019s decision, but we console those regulations all the major decisions in the company. But I think the key is how we operate as a Board and how we govern the company and I think it will be better for the shareholders as it has been. Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research : Okay, great. And then second question on the balance sheet, with the $47 billion reduction, clearly it helps the LCR, but can you give us a sense on how it benefited -- I'm sorry, the SLR, but can you give us a sense on how it might have improved your LCR, number one and if there is any additional benefits beyond leverage that helps the stress test? Bruce Thompson : A couple of questions, the first thing as we focus on the deposit I wouldn't say it benefited LCR but what it enabled us to do was to continue to rationalize the balance sheet without hurting LCR. That relates to the deposit optimization. With respect to the mortgage loans, the 6.5 billion that we\u2019ve referenced where we converted mortgage loans into agency securities, that's basically taking $6.5 billion of non-LCR benefit asset and converting them to $6.5 billion of LCR benefit. So that would have been the one pick up of the activities that we mentioned as well as just the reinvestment of repayment of legacy loan proceeds into securities once again helps LCR. So the actions with respect to build, one under the key balance sheet benefited LCR, the 15 billion of deposits just enable us to rationalize the overall size of balance sheet. As it relates to CCAR and the actions that then are taken, as we look to manage the company, we continue to look to manage out the higher risk categories of loans. And if you look at what we did in the second quarter with just over 2 billion of non-performing loan sales and $2.5 billion this quarter, we would clearly expect that as you look at those from a CCAR perspective, they would be higher loss content loans relative to the rest of the portfolio but the rational and the goal to move those out was to reduce the risk in a market environment that was very favorable. And we feel good about those actions that we took. Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research : So, is it fair to assume that you guys are near at the 100% LCR threshold? And I guess secondarily, should we expect balance sheet growth start -- loan deposit growth, balance sheet start to pick up from here or you\u2019ll have more to do? Bruce Thompson : So from an overall LCR perspective at the parent, we\u2019re at approximately 110% at the parent, so we're well in excess of where we need to ultimately be in 2017.Within the bank levels, we\u2019re well above the 80% level and would look to drive that to be north of 100% during the first half of 2015, well in advance of the 2017 implementation. And as it goes, as we move forward and we look at the balance sheet, the goal as we go forward and you saw a little bit, it's interesting, if you compare the loans in the three principal businesses where we make loans in the segments that we\u2019ve laid out here and that would be in our consumer business, in our wealth management business as well as in our global banking business that loans, average loans within those segments are up about 2% on a year-over-year basis. And we\u2019re clearly very focused on looking to drive out and push out and grow loans. We\u2019re obviously focused on growing deposits with our core customers, which will benefit LCR as well. And I think as it relates to the overall size of the balance sheet, we want to continue to be more efficient, but I don't think you're going to see the magnitude to move in the balance sheet going forward that you saw during this quarter. Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research : Okay, great. That's helpful, thanks. Operator : And we\u2019ll go next to Jon McDonald with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead. Jon McDonald - Sanford Bernstein : Hi Bruce, I wanted to follow-up on the NII outlook and the potential strategic actions. Is the potential 100 million headwind on the core NII, does that reflect the possible strategic actions or is that just reflecting the fact that reinvestment rates or the maturing capitals are lower today than they were in the second quarter? Bruce Thompson : It would reflect two things, Jon. It's both the role to spot risk as well as the buy ticket during the fourth quarter. Jon McDonald - Sanford Bernstein : Okay. And this buy ticket or these kind of actions that you might take, how might they impact your projections of rate sensitivity to rising short and long rates? Bruce Thompson : Well, to the extent that we don't reinvest in buildup cash, it will increase our asset sensitivity and the benefit to rising rates when that occurs. Jon McDonald - Sanford Bernstein : Okay. So you're not talking about a major restructuring of the bond portfolio; it's just being patient in terms of investing, I think I might have misunderstood the actions? Bruce Thompson : Yes. It should -- this is much more Jon I think just realizing what we've seen during the quarter and being cautious on buy ticket during the fourth quarter to manage net interest income risk with OCI risk. But we're not talking about any kind of material shift; we're just flagging something for you to get into magnitude of the rate move that we've seen so far this quarter. Jon McDonald - Sanford Bernstein : Got it. Okay, totally understood. Thank you. And Bruce, just in terms of the FAS 91 or the premium amortization charges that move around with the 10 year, is that pretty proportional to how the 10 year moves up and down or are there levels where it stops kind of being a straight-line impact? Bruce Thompson : I would say that the -- it tends to move, the FAS 91 moves most and it's most correlated to the 10 year. And I would say that if you look at OCI risk it tends to be more correlated to long-term mortgage rates. Jon McDonald - Sanford Bernstein : Okay. And just a follow-up on the provision, just wondering how we should think about kind of jumping off point for the provision relative to the kind of $600 million reported, or the $200 million ex-DOJ this quarter? How should we think about where to start off with that? Bruce Thompson : Yes. I think Jon, I would look at the charge-offs adjusted for the portfolio sales that we said came down from 1.3 to 1.2 and assuming the overall economic environment doesn\u2019t change. We have continued to see improvements in the credit portfolios. And I think practically speaking if you look at the reserve release during the quarter once you adjust for the DOJ amount of 400 that you\u2019re not going to see reserve releases. I think clearly they will be a fair bit below the $800 million that we would have seen this quarter on an adjusted basis. Jon McDonald - Sanford Bernstein : Okay. That's helpful. And then just on capital builds, Bruce, it seems like you're still able to grow the Tier 1 common at a multiple of the GAAP earnings. Is that primarily as DTA and could you remind us what the status of the DTA balance is and how much is disallowed currently? Bruce Thompson : Sure. The disallowed amount continues to be in the $15 billion to $16 billion criteria. And as we look out between now and the end of 2015, we would expect to that the CET1 should build generally consistent with pre-tax earnings all the way through the end of 2015. Jon McDonald - Sanford Bernstein : Okay. Thank you. Bruce Thompson : Thank you, Jon. Operator : And we\u2019ll go next to Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead. Mike Mayo - CLSA: Hi, good morning. Were there any gains from the $2.5 billion of NPA sales? Bruce Thompson : I believe between what came through in the charge-off line and the net, I think the NPAs were roughly $150 million, Mike. Mike Mayo - CLSA: $150 million gain? Bruce Thompson : Correct. Mike Mayo - CLSA: Okay. And as far as the outlook for rates, have you changed your rate assumption for the next year, given what the 10 year has done? Bruce Thompson : We look at rate assumptions what we do is when we go through our internal forecasting process, we snap and manage the business just based on the forward curve of what the market is telling us. And clearly I think if we look out at and look at the rate movement that we've seen over the course of the last couple of weeks, people are obviously more cautious if rates may not be moving up at the level that they had had, but it's clearly been very volatile over the last 30 days. Mike Mayo - CLSA: And is that changing the way you're managing the portfolio or the company? In other words, at what point do you look at the low rate environment and say our prior assumptions might have been off a little bit; we need to revise the approach? Bruce Thompson : Well, I think that as we look forward, Mike, and I think it's a little bit of why we said what we did about a little bit of caution during the fourth quarter that at this point as we look out and given the impact that OCI has the capital until we see where rates settle out if they continue to move around, we continue to be very cautious with the buy ticket and when we do it we're investing clearly a little bit shorter than longer at this point given the risk that OCI has the capital and being mindful of that. Mike Mayo - CLSA: Sure. No, it's tough figuring out the rate environment right now. I'm just revisiting the comment you made. You said expenses should move more directionally with revenues. And if I look at the first 9 months, I guess revenues are down, but expenses are down more. Do you mean that instead of having positive operating leverage, it might be flat operating leverage looking ahead? Bruce Thompson : I think there is couple of things, Mike. The first is that I want to make sure that we emphasize is that we still have a couple of $100 million of expenses to get out in the LAS area between now and the first quarter of 2015. And clearly, $1.1 million of LAS expenses that we\u2019ve set to get too in the first quarter of '15 is not where we would expect to operate on a longer term basis and there is additional work that we need to do there. The second area, just broadly speaking that we highlighted that clearly we'd expect given what litigation expense that over time is going to come down. And then the third thing and when I said directionally expenses moving with revenues is just if we look at some of the areas particularly within the wealth management area that we've seen, there is a component of compensation and incentive, it\u2019s very clearly tied to revenues, not unlike what you see within the global banking and the global market space. Mike Mayo - CLSA: Okay. And then two questions for Brian or perhaps for you Bruce; and I know I asked this before. But if rates do not go higher in 2015, what is Bank of America\u2019s ROE target? Brian Moynihan : I think if rates don\u2019t go higher, what you see in terms of earnings is what we're -- what we\u2019ve got to drive to this quarter. So Mike, when you look at the charts Bruce showed you and I showed, you can see that the core businesses burned several billion dollars after-tax this quarter and CRES business took it away; and as that comes down, you'll see those earnings flow through. We don't -- and so you can compute the ROE based on that. But basically we're -- you can see on page 18, the net income levels across the businesses each quarter. And our job is to take commercial real estate business, which is you see for the year-to-date, if you take to commercial real estate business which is loss money, get that back to breakeven. And that\u2019s the work we will do in absence of rate rising; it\u2019s not a lot different than it is right now. Mike Mayo - CLSA: And then lastly, just following up from the other question relating to the separation of the CEO and the Chairman role, when you can consult with regulators, do they care one way or another if the CEO and Chair position is split? And there is several corporate governance experts who say that it's better to have those two roles split and others say it doesn't matter. Do you know what the regulator view is on that, because you're going from what some consider a preferred corporate governance approach putting the CEO and Chair role to now combining them? Brian Moynihan : I think that what they have been cleared about in the published documents, published by the OCC and their heightened standards, their enhanced standards but recently in the Fed, they care about the engagement of the board and the diversity of the board and the experience of the board and we have a good board and it's experienced and has all the diversity and credible challenge and all the words that are used to describe that. And I'd see that's the core of the governance point that they make. Mike Mayo - CLSA: Alright. Thank you. Operator : And we'll go next to Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank : Good morning. If I could just follow up on some of the capital commentary provided, especially on the deck; it seems like there is a number of adjustments that were made this quarter or just quite after the quarter you consolidated the bank subs, there is some increase in operational risk RWA. You comment on OCI managing for that. Just think kind of big picture on managing capital, what's left and is there opportunity to bring down some of the off balance sheet exposures, now that you have kind of more final roles on the SLR? Bruce Thompson : Sure. I think I would start and just reiterate as we look at capital on a go forward basis, you basically have three items that are going to affect things. The first is your level of profitability and I just want to reiterate that we would expect once again on a go forward basis to accrete capital on a pre-tax basis. And the second is the impact that OCI has to those capital ratios, we obviously saw during the quarter rates went up on the mortgage side, I believe it was about 5 basis points during the quarter. And there were some security gains as well and that was what was led to the change in the overall OCI. And as I said before, given the environment we\u2019re in where rates are down about 30 basis points so far quarter-to-date that will have a benefit today to capital and we\u2019re just mindful of reinvesting so that we don\u2019t take on any greater OCI risk on a go forward basis. As it relates to what we\u2019re looking through and as you look at the overall risk-weighted asset work that\u2019s been done, I would say that clearly as we continue to work through the legacy home equity, as well as the first mortgage portfolios that do not benefit from the stand-by agreement as we continue to work those assets down that should enable us to grow the core and still keep risk-weighted assets generally constant. And I think more specific to your point, the other two things are that we continue to look to work through and we have the run-off of some of the structured credit and other portfolios that we\u2019re trying to accelerate that come off between now and 2017. And then the last piece that we continue to work hard on and you saw it in the up risk that as we updated the models for the time series you do have the increase to risk-weighted assets. And we\u2019re working hard to get to where we need to be from that model perspective as we would hope in 2015 if we\u2019re successful to go ahead and exit parallel run at that point. Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank : Okay. And then as you think about -- I guess the adjustment on the operational risk RWA side, do you think that's about done or is it an ongoing process until you hopefully exit the parallel run? Bruce Thompson : Yes. I think it's obviously as others have noted, it's an ongoing process. I think the important thing is if you compare our operational risk number relative to our peers, we're roughly 30%. And if you do the math against the risk-weighted assets, we're at the, if not the top, the upper-end of where others are from that. But we obviously have work to do to get that finalized to be in a position to exit. Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank : Okay. And then just separately within the C&I lending book, you talked about pricing pressure, as well as some pay downs, but I guess specifically on the pricing pressure, what are you seeing now versus a quarter or two ago when you were still trying to grow or growing the book in terms of not just the magnitude of pricing, but what types of products? Bruce Thompson : Sure. I would say that the most competitive area that we continue to see is within the commercial banking space of our Global Banking segment which are those middle market type companies that tend to be loans that have one or two banks provide all of the credit. And clearly the remaining services that go along with servicing those customers tends to go to those that provide the credit. And that's where you've seen the most competition. I think it's interesting if you look at and go back to our table on the international side as we've continued to shape the balance sheet and look for a return, you've actually seen a step-up in the yield in our international lending activity. And within the large corporate space of our Global Banking space, we have seen some stability in yields within that. So and really focused most importantly it's within the commercial, the middle market commercial space where we're seeing the most pressure on yields. Brian Moynihan : So just to add a little color there, our view was along two dimensions. One, on the international side, we had strong loan growth, a couple of years ago in the last year. And now we have to materialize our structured management and other revenue streams under increasing our credit exposure and Tom and the team growing the business. So, there is sort of -- with growth of loans that there has to be a fall through of growth of transaction revenue et cetera. And on the middle market, I think the team went for optimization and we are going to continue to stress if they needed to be able to manage both the optimization and the growth of the portfolio. So we're pushing on them, they get the balance probably back a little bit more in SKUs than they had in the last couple of quarters. Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank : Okay, alright. Thank you very much. Operator : And we'll go next to Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead. Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research : Good morning, this is Guy. A question on, first of all, the optimization that you talked about with respect to commercial deposits around $15 billion and the -- I think roughly $12 billion in securities financing transactions. Should we look at those two things as directly related to each other? Bruce Thompson : I think they\u2019re related to each other that we think it's prudent balance sheet management. But there are independent actions that are part of prudent balance sheet management. Brian Moynihan : So Guy it's dramatically, but not necessary directly. Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research : Okay. So the $15 billion isn't all essentially prime brokerage-related as well like the asset reduction that you are talking about? Bruce Thompson : No, it's not. Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research : Okay. That's helpful. Another question is with respect to the provision related to the DOJ settlement. Should we look at this $400 million, which as you said offset what would have been an $800 million reserve release? Should we look at that as essentially now a one-time true up and going forward you now feel that you have the provision that you\u2019ll need for multiple years to fulfill the settlement terms or is the settlement going essentially be a pay as you go through the provision? Bruce Thompson : So, to be clear, when we set out the $5 billion reserve or the $5.3 billion hit this quarter that was to cover cash payments as well as all expected cost associated with implementing our $7 billion of consumer release. And the part of it that flows into the provision line item is $400 million, that is a reserve to take care of the -- what would have been the P&L impact from the modifications that would happen within the different loans that we're modifying. So, on a go forward basis, assuming that we\u2019ve got to set up the way that we do, there should not be any future P&L impact from DoJ. The only impact that will be on the balance sheet is you see the reserve number come down as we implement the consumer relief programs. Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research : Got it. That's a very helpful explanation. Thanks. And finally, cyber security issues, obviously you were not the bank that\u2019s been in the crosshairs here and yet I would imagine that this is something that has caused some consternation internally and some spending. JP Morgan has talked about a $250 million budget for cyber security issues, which is expected to double. Can you give us a sense for what you are spending there and how you'd expected to increase? Brian Moynihan : Obviously, it\u2019s the matter that we take very seriously from the Board engagement, the talent that we have in the Board to help us with this all the way through management, Cathy Bessant, her team in tech and ops. And we spend hundreds of millions of dollars on a year and it\u2019s been growing. And we expect to continue to grow; it\u2019s the key to keep our customers and our teammates secure. And we continue to work on it. So, this is nothing but hard work and we continue to work with both the law enforcement authorities, various government agencies and among our industry through very straight moves and formal engagements to try to drive our competencies in industry up. So we\u2019re spending a lot of money on it, several hundreds of millions of dollars and we expect that to continue to increase. Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research : Thanks. I actually do have one more, if that\u2019s all right, and it\u2019s with respect to the rep and warranty RPL which in the footnote you said it\u2019s the same as it was last quarter at about $4 billion. Can you update us on where you are with any lawsuits related to the non-country wide originations which are, which add up to around $420 billion of UPB? Bruce Thompson : So, if you recall Guy, what we\u2019ve done and what we continue to refine each quarter is that as we continue to see rep and warrant claims, there was a reserve setup back in the second quarter of 2011, a piece of it was for Gibbs & Bruns. There was a piece of it that was for bank issued rep and warrant and then there was a piece that was for third party. And we obviously look at those reserves each quarter and adjust those reserves for the activity in those cases where we have enough activity to have our reserve. We obviously have those into those areas that are still uncertain; we provide the range of possible laws. And as you reference the range of possible loss with respect to rep and warrant activity continues to be up to $4 billion. Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research : Okay, so no movement there obviously this quarter? Bruce Thompson : That's correct. Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research : Yes. Thanks very much. Bruce Thompson : Thank you. Operator : And we'll go next to with Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead. Brennan Hawken - UBS: Good morning, guys, a quick one on loan growth. So at first glance, it looked kind of weak. It seemed to be driven by consumer. I just want to make sure I've got sort of the right adjustments here that I think you guys have laid out. In mortgage, $12.5 billion decline sequentially, but should we be backing out the $2.5 billion of NPL sales and then the $6.5 billion of agency conversion from that decline so you know you get kind of like a normalized decline rate sequentially of more like $3.5 billion on the mortgage side? Bruce Thompson : Yes. I think it's a good question. So the decision to move the 6.5 loan to security forum was based on LCR. It doesn't change the fact that when you move out, but you still have the asset on the balance sheet. So I think that $6.5 billion is a fair adjustment to make. And I would agree that the $2.5 billion where we still have the non-performing loans and quite frankly there is not much left there to attack. It's a fair adjustment which gets you to the $9 billion. The other thing when you look at the loans that I do think is important is that from -- on the home equity side, with those legacy home equity portfolios which we want to get repaid that repayments within those were roughly $3.5 billion which were greater than the funded amount that came on from a new home equity origination perspective. So I come back to that within those more discretionary portfolios what's happening there is what we want to happen there that they\u2019re repaying and we're converting them to more liquid instruments. And as we look at actual business activity and how we're doing, we'd focus you back within the segment. And as we talked about within the consumer business where average loans were up a little bit linked quarter on a card basis where we saw very strong continued growth within the home equity space, go back to the wealth management area where loans reached a record level. And then I think we've already addressed the work that we need to do on the commercial front. Brennan Hawken - UBS: Sure, sure. And maybe if you could, is it possible to give us an idea about the run-off portfolio, what's left in that at this stage and what your guys\u2019 expectations are for like a run-off headwind just so we can think about it for modeling purposes? Bruce Thompson : Sure. I think I would look at as you go forward given that we're not buying home loans from third-parties that you\u2019re probably looking at a high single-digit continued reduction for the next couple of quarters with respect to home loans that we hold for others. The second thing I'd say that you have is you've got roughly $3 billion a quarter in home equity pay-offs, a portion of which will be mitigated by new originations, but you are looking at roughly three there. And then you have some other kind of less than a billion dollar type items. But I think it's fair to say that as you go forward outside of what we think is core, you\u2019re probably looking at in the consumer businesses in the zip code of $10 billion to $12 billion that will go away and we\u2019ll either have the ability to reinvest and make new loans or otherwise reinvest. Brennan Hawken - UBS:  Okay. And that's on a quarterly headwind basis? Bruce Thompson : Correct. Brennan Hawken - UBS: Okay, terrific. And then thinking about wealth management, could you breakdown the expansion in the margins there this quarter? How much of it came from reduced spending? I know you guys have been investing there and so maybe could you help us understand how much of a contributing factor that was here this quarter and how much investment is left to wind down here? Bruce Thompson : I'm sorry, when you reference margin, margin in what area? Brennan Hawken - UBS: Sorry, wealth management and pre-tax? Bruce Thompson : Yes. If you look at it and you go through the different areas, you tend to have 40% type payouts with respect to the revenue piece. So when you look at the margin improvement of a couple of 100 basis points, I would put it more in the context of just good core expense management. I do think there was a little bit less litigation within the quarter that benefited us. But it tends to be just across the board, whether it be a little bit lower support cost, a little bit lower licensing fee number or a little bit less litigation. There was no one number that was particularly dominated in driving the margin. Brian Moynihan : And last quarter, we had some start up cost for the Merrill one product that you can see has had strong success in terms of that AUM. So that was sort of in the second quarter and now those expenses have to roll that out that comes back after. Brennan Hawken - UBS: Yes. So that technology spent also rolled off too, which probably helped, right? Bruce Thompson : Exactly. If you remember last quarter we talked about it they had a decline it was because some of the stuff was going in, in this quarter you saw it revert back to more where they have pretty consistently been over the last many quarters. Brennan Hawken - UBS: Cool, cool. All right, I seem to remember that being somewhere in the ballpark of like $50 million to $100 million is that right? Bruce Thompson : I think it was all in that much, but whether it was all in that one quarter or not, I don\u2019t remember. Brennan Hawken - UBS: Okay. So the decline from that might be less so? Brian Moynihan : Yes. Brennan Hawken - UBS: Cool. And then last one, I know you guys have talked about here the repositioning that you guys want to take as far as AOCI risk and such. When we think about the AOCI hit that you guys lay out versus other money centers in the interest rate shock, it\u2019s a little bit higher than where some of the other folks are. And so hoping to maybe get a little bit of color on where the current duration is, where you expect the duration to go based upon the actions that you take. And then maybe help us also square the circle of understanding the larger AOCI hit and whether that\u2019s a result of a barbelling with the portfolio or what? Bruce Thompson : Sure. First, I just want to clear up that there is in the quarter, the only comment with respect to the quarter we\u2019re referencing is just to caution on the buy ticket given where interest rates are at this point during the quarter. I think if you go back and you look at over the last couple of quarters, it\u2019s been a very consistent message and that we\u2019ve said that we\u2019re going to direct more of the buy ticket to shorter date and treasury. And you can see that there has been a buildup of those treasuries over the course of the last three to four quarters. So, this quarter was a continuation to that and we were just calling out a note of caution given the rate environment. I think as it relates to overall OCI sensitivity, if you look at what we\u2019ve typically said is in 100 basis points parallel move up in rates, how long does it take back or take to earn back that OCI, we\u2019ve said consistently it\u2019s been around three years, it peaked at about three and half years and at the end of September it would have been less than three years. So we have kind of on a consistent trend line continued to look to move down the overall OCI risk as it presents itself to capital. Brennan Hawken - UBS: Okay. So is it right then to assume that duration on the AFS portfolio is a little under three years or is that not a correct interest? Bruce Thompson : No that's the period of time that it takes to earn it back. You're looking at the overall -- I think the overall duration is going to be in the plus five years. Brennan Hawken - UBS: Okay, thanks a lot. Bruce Thompson : Thank you. Operator : And we'll go next to with Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Ken Usdin - Jefferies: Hi, thanks. Just a question just on the trading business, obviously you guys and the other companies did well amidst the volatility in September. And I\u2019m just wondering with regard to the balance sheet changes you guys have been making and the optimization of RWAs and given what\u2019s happening in the environment right now, any changes in terms of how Tom\u2019s running that business as far as being able to capture the revenue opportunity out there, or any inhibition given by your views around risk taking and these capital balance sheet changes that you guys have talked about today? Brian Moynihan : I\u2019d refer you to page 21 in the appendix in the lower left hand corner. And you can see this is the third quarter \u201812, \u201813 and \u201814 laid out side-by-side. And so I don't think this is a change in position and if you look at the average trading weighted assets of 460 to 440, the bars 55 million and 56 million, 50 million and you can see the revenue. So we've probably done a good job of building a relatively stable -- business is going to fluctuate in the market but a relatively stable core amount of activity comes through this. And if you look at it over several quarters with the exception of seasonality in the first quarter that typically occurs each year but we\u2019ve laid this out for you second quarter throughout \u201813, \u201814 last quarter and third quarter. You see it's a relatively consistent $3 billion revenue type of number and we've maintain that. So adjustments we've made in the business on expenses, the scope of activities and stuff we actually made in \u201810 and \u201811 to bring that business inline. So we're very comfortable where they are now. They are always moving around impairing risks and continue to manage carefully the overall returns of the business. Its relative size to our company, we think we got in a good place, we simplified it. And so there is no change in strategy here. And in fact you can see there is a fairly consistent results from that activity. What's different this quarter versus last quarter obviously without the UK taxing you're seeing the bottom-line comes through the third quarter. But we've made $700 million after-tax and that's a good performance. Ken Usdin - Jefferies: Thanks, Brian. And to follow just on the mortgage business, the servicing line has continued to just trickle out. I'm just wondering have we seen the bottoming of the former sales and the related revenues moving away from that. Brian Moynihan : I think if you look at the servicing revenue, as I said, the biggest reason for the decline was an adjustment in the cost to serve. If you saw the actual servicing fee line that came through linked quarter it was only down about $25 million on a linked quarter basis. And so what you're going to see on a go forward basis is not so much the impact on the sale of MSRs, but just the servicing revenue that's derived based on the size of the MSR assets. So given that there aren\u2019t any more large scale sales of that MSR, you're going to see that more very on a core basis as opposed to a step function. Ken Usdin - Jefferies: And the pre-tax? Brian Moynihan : What we'll see is that the number 60 plus delinquents continues to normalize now, we have to continue to push that that's where we think that we\u2019re going to get the additional expense leverage in LAS going forward. And so it's $100 million this quarter and couple of $100 million. It\u2019s just grinding through and working those loans for the customers and modifying or short selling and going through foreclosure. So that number is still elevated as a percentage, you can see it. And if you look at our delinquency off of the things we produced really since after the crisis, the numbers are much smaller and imply delinquency level ultimately half that amount that you see now. So that's where the real work will come in unit reduction. The overall 3.9 million units is fluctuating around a little bit, but we're kind of getting to equilibrium where our production is nearly what runs off had some sales and the 60 plus bucket. Ken Usdin - Jefferies: And my last follow-up just on that point, you had talked about $1.1 billion by 1Q 2015. You had previously talked about getting it down to about $500 million a year out from that. Is that still a reasonable expectation given that backdrop you just laid out? Brian Moynihan : The first thing that we're focused on is getting it done through a billion one and then longer term, I think if you look at any metric with where we would see from a number of loan service, as well as the number of delinquent loans in the portfolio. We still have some significant work to do to drive billion one down, because given the size of the portfolio it's way too high. Ken Usdin - Jefferies: Okay. Thanks guys. Operator : And we'll go next to Paul Miller with FBR Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Paul Miller - FBR Capital Markets : Yes, I just wanted to follow up on that. You talk about 60 day delinquent loans down 42,000 to 221,000. I don't think there is any sale of that. Is that just working through the portfolio and that seems like a very high pace? Can we expect that type of pace or what type of pace of loans do you think you can work out on a quarterly or annualized basis? Bruce Thompson : Yes. There were some servicing transfers during the quarter. My recollection is that was between 20,000 and 25,000 units that were actually transferred during the quarter. So it was a very good quarter for us as far as MSR sales and driving that number down. But I think you\u2019re right that on a go forward basis it\u2019s not going to be at that level, although we do think we\u2019ll make some significant progress between now and the end of \u201815. Paul Miller - FBR Capital Markets : Outside of the servicing trends, it was 20,000 to 25,000, so it was down roughly about 15,000 give or take, give or take 1,000 loans. Is that a pace that we could model going forward? Bruce Thompson : There are obviously a lot of factors that can go into that that are going to happen, but I don\u2019t think -- if you believe that with what we\u2019re saying from the quality of the portfolio and you believe the foreclosure process continues along the same trends. You\u2019re probably looking at plus minus 20,000 units a quarter on an organic basis on a net basis. Paul Miller - FBR Capital Markets : Okay. And then relative to the big Department of Justice settlement, where do you think you are on legal costs? I know it's hard to sit there and say, but we've seen a couple other competitors get the Department of Justice behind them, but there still tends to be this nagging $1 billion here and there in legal costs that just won't go away. Where do you think we are -- is Bank of America, since they've paid probably the most out than anybody, are you more through that than most other people? Bruce Thompson : Well, Some of that stuff that people experience are pieces that we have already taken care of in prior quarters and some of it relates to completely different \u2013 as it relates to mortgage matters, some relates to other matters. We will always have litigation expense in this company. But in terms of the mortgage, we have talked to you in many quarters, but if you think just last three quarters three major pieces still behind and we\u2019re still waiting for the ultimate approval of the Gibbs & Bruns settlement, 95% of the RMBS by principal amount. We had settlements and settlements at this point are awaiting final approval. So yes, a lot of pieces we have settled up FHA and things like that along the way. So, we\u2019ve got in the monolines, four out of the five are settled. So, we've been picking a way. And so without knowing all the ins and outs of the other competitors, from our standpoint, a lot of the smaller stuff was getting done as a lot of you focused on largest things, a lot of the smaller stuff is coming in and out every quarter underneath that and we should see less of that going forward. Paul Miller - FBR Capital Markets : Okay. Hey guys, thank you very much. Brian Moynihan : Thank you. Operator : And we'll go next to Matthew Burnell with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Brian Moynihan : Hey Matt. Matthew Burnell - Wells Fargo : Hi Brian, thanks for taking my question. I guess just a question in terms of the investment banking product rankings on page 32. Obviously most of the numbers are in the top three, particularly in the more important categories. I guess just looking at the global rankings in terms of some of the numbers that aren\u2019t in the top three, are there further investments you all plan to make in that business that would have any effect on the operating expense ratios in Global Banking or is that pretty much steady state in terms of the investments you all are putting into those businesses? Brian Moynihan : I think as a broad construct and I think you're asking the more strategic level. Christian Meissner and the team with Tom have done good job of adding people in the markets where we needed to build our capabilities and we\u2019re always looking to add more and more talent, more and more capabilities. I don't think there is any huge change in expenses or numbers. It's more of a continuously upgrading our talent and adding incremental talent. But in the grand scheme of things, it's a pretty small expense base in the context for our company with the level of expenses. But your point is exactly right. The global, the U.S. competitors, our franchise is obviously demonstrably stronger as you can see in the U.S. rankings versus the global. The global bas picked up honestly. And as activity picks up in Europe and Asia, we continue to drive forward. But we still are working hard to improve our positioning in it across the board but we\u2019ve made a lot of investments already. Matthew Burnell - Wells Fargo : And then if I could just ask a follow-up on the commercial -- non-U.S. commercial loans, couple of competitors have mentioned that there has been some weakness in trade finance lending. And I am just curious how much if any that has affected the loan growth within the non-U.S. commercial side of the balance sheet? Bruce Thompson : It has affected us in two ways. So when you look at the decline that we saw within the loans outside of the U.S., a chunk of that decline was a decline in trade finance. So I think what's also notable is the trade finance test to have the lowest spreads. So when you look at the yields within the international loan portfolio, they\u2019re up. And that's because you've got more corporate type loans that have higher spreads than trade finance which tends to have lower spreads. Matthew Burnell - Wells Fargo : Thanks very much, Bruce. Bruce Thompson : Thank you. Operator : And we'll go next to Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Chris Kotowski - Oppenheimer: Mine were asked and answered. Thank you. Brian Moynihan :  Thanks Chris. Operator : And we'll go next to Steven Chubak with Nomura. Please go ahead. Steven Chubak - Nomura: Hi, good morning. Bruce, the first question regards capital and profitability targets. I know at a recent investor conference, you alluded to the fact that you believe that CCAR currently represents the binding capital constrain for the bank which is just that presumably you'll need to manage to a higher core Tier 1, which I guess from my perspective could put at risk the 14% [ROTE] goal that you guys had established in the early part of this year. And I suppose it's really a two-part. First, what core Tier 1 target do you believe you'll need to manage over the cycle and then as a follow-up to that, how does that inform your outlook for meeting that goal? Bruce Thompson : Sure. Well, a couple of things. I go back to the first comment, which is that you have to break out a little bit what\u2019s going to happen for our company over the next five quarters between the growth in tangible common equity versus the growth in regulatory capital that flows into the capital ratio, because as I said before, over the next five quarters, we'll accrete capital on a pre-tax basis absent any other changes. But it\u2019s the first thing I keep in mind. The second thing is that as we look out we do believe at this point that CCAR is the governor and we\u2019re obviously getting ready to go into the 2015 CCAR process and without instructions or any assumptions or scenarios that I think it's premature to look at that. The third thing is you look at return targets and Mike touched on this a little bit in his earlier question. I think the thing that as we look to get into those 12%, 14% type targets, the thing I would encourage you to do, because I do think that you start to get a bridge to that is if you take the earnings that we announced today in normalize and for the things that I touched on in my comments, you tend to be starting at a point that's in the 10% plus type return during the quarter from a tangible common equity perspective. And you've got really four things that are going to change that on a go forward basis. The continued reduction within our LAS expenses, we would expect obviously longer term litigation expenses to go down. You have the benefit of rate. And then you've got what we do within the core businesses. So those are the four things that we're focused on. And the last point I would say is it relates to just CCAR, we feel like getting ready for CCAR during this quarter and quite frankly throughout the year that we've made a lot of work between moving out of the company, those assets that tend to have low or high loss contents. In stress, we\u2019ve augmented our CET1 ratios as we\u2019ve gone forward. And we think we\u2019ve taken a lot of tail risk out. So long-winded way of saying you can kind of look at the bridge to more normalized returns when you adjust what we saw this quarter. We feel very good about the progress that we\u2019ve made as we prepare for CCAR. We\u2019ll look to see what the instructions are and we\u2019ll have to see if our assumption about that being the governor given the evolving regulatory landscape continues to be the case or if we need to update that assessment. Steven Chubak - Nomura: All right. Thanks for that, Bruce. That's really helpful. And then just switching gears to the liquidity side of the equation, one measure which hasn't garnered very much attention is the net stable funding ratio. And my understanding is that Basel's at least intended goal was to have the NSFR calibration completed by the end of this year. And I was hoping you could disclose where you currently stand on this metric? Bruce Thompson : So we do not have an exact number to disclose at this point. What I would say is we worked through and we\u2019ve done the work to get to where we needed to be from an LCR perspective that at this point there is not anything that gives us any concern that we\u2019re going to have to change it any material way and what we\u2019re doing to satisfy NSFR. Steven Chubak - Nomura: All right, thanks. And maybe just one more quick modeling question. I was hoping you could clarify given all the preferred issuance that's been done, assuming nothing incremental is completed going forward in terms of issuance, what the preferred coupon should be on an annualized basis next year? Bruce Thompson : I\u2019ve got an exact number for you. Bear with me one second. You should see during next year a preferred number of 1262. Steven Chubak - Nomura: All right, perfect. That's it for me. Thanks for taking my questions. Bruce Thompson : Thank you. Operator : And there are no further questions at this time. Brian Moynihan : Thank you everyone. Look forward to seeing you next quarter. Operator : This does conclude today's conference. You may now disconnect and have a wonderful day.",

And welcome to the Bank of America Earnings Announcement Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode, but later you\u2019ll have the opportunity to ask questions during the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Please note this call is being recorded. It\u2019s now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Mr. Lee McEntire. Please go ahead. Lee McEntire : Good morning, thanks to everybody on the phone, as well as the webcast for joining us this morning for the fourth quarter results. Hopefully you guys have had a chance to review the earnings release documents available on the Web site. Before I turn the call over to Brian and Bruce, let me just remind you, we may make forward-looking statements. For further information on those, please refer to either our earnings release documents, our Web site or our other SEC filings. So with that, let me turn it over to Brian Moynihan, our CEO for some opening comments, before Bruce Thompson the CFO goes through the details. Thank you. Brian Moynihan : Thank you, Lee and good morning and thank all of you for joining us to review our fourth quarter results for 2014. As we think about the year, we\u2019ve accomplished a lot, including resolving many significant legacy issues that were overshadowing the underlying progress in our financials. Solving these issues obviously came at a cost and drove a decline in year-over-year net income. But importantly it settles through the uncertainty for all of us, for investors, regulators, rating agencies and others, allowed us to focus on the core business and operation of the company going forward. As we move to Slide 2, you could see that we have a simplified and stronger company. Today we reported earnings of $3.1 billion after tax. The company is simpler and more straightforward with improved risk profile. Everything we do now is focused on driving the company forward and delivering for our customers and clients. On this slide you can see some of the important results, this year we completed probably the industry\u2019s largest ever cost savings program which achieved $8 billion of annualized savings. Let\u2019s think about that, we started that program in 2011 when we had around 290,000 FTE and over the last three years since then driving it the right way we completed 2014 ending the year with around 220,000 FTEs. Non-interest expense excluding litigation declined 4.4 billion compared from 2013 to 2014 and is down more than $8 billion the last couple of years, and yet we have more work to do ahead of us. We further strengthened an already strong liquid balance sheet and increased our common stock dividend during 2014 for the first time since 2007. As you can see on this page, our credit costs are at a decade low level. So, notwithstanding the headwinds our industry faces with rates on an ongoing global economic sluggishness, we\u2019ve built a platform for growth, especially in the context of continuous improving of U.S. economy. We have built a company with leading market positions across every core customer base. And our task now is, continue to build on that foundation and the progress we\u2019ve made. As you look at our results, you\u2019d see that year-over-year earnings in our primary businesses with exceptions with the consumer real-estate business made progress that shows stability in a volatile rate geopolitical environment. Importantly as you think about our company, we have been investing growth, while taking out expense. We reduced our overall headcount during 2014 by around 8% but at the same time we invested. We invested by reallocating resources to sales capacity from those savings, increasing in all our core businesses. We invested by reallocating expense reductions to product capabilities and both capabilities our cash management capabilities and other capabilities around the world. We\u2019ve invested some of the savings in our technology, spending over $3 billion in 2014 to improve and protect our company. Now you can see the results in the appendix pages and Bruce will touch on them in the line of business presentations. We expect to continue this effort going forward. We have teams working on it every day. They are working to be allocating non-productive expense to drive towards growth. The line management obtained a good expense management come to expect from our company. At the same time we are laser focused on money market sharing growth with our customers the economy continues to improve and we look forward to reporting that progress during the year ahead. With that I\u2019ll turn it over to Bruce to take you through the quarter\u2019s numbers. Bruce Thompson : Great. Thanks, Brian and good morning everyone. Let\u2019s start on Slide 3, and I am going to go through the details. During the fourth quarter, we recorded $3.1 billion of earnings or $0.25 per diluted share. Let me give you a few thoughts on revenues. There were two significant adjustments to revenue, as well as negative DVA charges that in the aggregate reduced reported revenues this quarter by $1.2 billion pretax or roughly $0.07 a share after tax. Of the components of the $1.2 billion impact, we recorded roughly $578 million negative market related adjustments which as you all know we refer to as FAS 91 and net interest income for the acceleration of bond premium amortization on our debt securities that was driven by lower long-term rates, otherwise our core net interest income which excludes this market related adjustment was pretty stable with the fourth quarter coming in a little bit better than we signaled to you all during our third quarter earnings call. In addition, this quarter we adopted FVA which is for Funding Valuation Adjustment and incurred a $497 million charge against our sales and trading results as a result of that adoption. And as we normally provide to you a credit spreads tightened and this tightening caused the negative charge for DVA in the trading account of approximately $130 million during the quarter. Expenses during the quarter were well managed. Our total non-interest expense in the fourth quarter was $14.2 billion which included approximately $400 million in litigation expense during the quarter. This level of expense is the lowest level of expense that we\u2019ve seen since the Merrill Lynch merger. And credit cost during the quarter improved as our provision for credit losses was $219 million and included 660 million in the release of reserves. On Slide 4, reduced asset levels in our global markets business drove our balance sheet levels lower, coming down $19 billion from the third quarter of '14 and we finished at just over 2.1 trillion in assets. We continued our focus on balance sheet optimization for liquidity, as we continue to shift our discretionary portfolio into HQLA eligible securities from non-HQLA loans and also improved our deposit composition. As we have signaled to you in the third quarter earnings call, discretionary portfolio first lien loans declined from the third quarter of '14 levels, but we were very pleased with the loan growth we saw in our core businesses during the quarter. If we look in those core businesses, global banking loans increased $4 billion during the quarter. Within wealth management loan balances grew $3 billion. And our U.S. consumer credit card receivables increased $2.9 billion during the quarter. We did have a $2.7 billion decline in our direct and indirect portfolio as we transferred a portfolio of student loans to held-for-sale. Our deposits grew from the end of the third quarter while short-term funding declined. We executed another successful issuance of 1.4 billion of preferred stock early in the third quarter and that benefited regulatory capital. Shareholders\u2019 equity improved with both the earnings growth as well as the improvements in AOCI. As a result of that our tangible book value increased to $14.43 per share and our tangible common equity ratio improved to 7.47%. We move to regulatory capital on Slide 5, under the transition rules, our CET1 ratio was 12.3%, we look at our Basel III regulatory capital metrics on a fully phased-in basis, CET1 capital improved $6.2 billion during the quarter that was driven by earnings, deferred tax utilization as well as the improvement in AOCI. Our operational risk weighted assets during the quarter increased again, they now represent 34% of total risk weighted assets but not withstanding that increase we were able to keep our Basel III advance ratio at level of consistence with what we saw at the end of third quarter. Under the standardized approach, our CET1 ratio improved from 9.5% in the third quarter of '14 to 10% at the end of the year. We look at our supplementary leverage ratios. We\u2019ve done a lot of work over the past year to improve those, obviously the fully phased-in kick-in in 2018. We look at where we ended the quarter, in our bank holding company our SLR ratio was a 5.9% and primary banking subsidiary BANA we were at approximately 7%. We turn to Slide 6, funding and liquidity, long-term debt ended the quarter at 243 billion, down 7 billion from the third quarter of '14. We have done a lot of work over the past couple of years to smooth out our parent company maturity profile and as you can see we have $22 billion scheduled to mature in 2015 and comparable amounts over the next 4 to 5 years. Our global excess liquidity sources reached a record level during the quarter and closed at $439 billion and within those global excess liquidity sources our parent company liquidity improved 5 billion from the end of the third quarter to $98 billion at the end of the year. Time to required funding increased to 39 months during the fourth quarter and during the quarter if we continued to increase our estimated liquidity coverage ratios at both the consolidated as well as at the bank levels. At the end of the year we\u2019re well ahead of the 100% fully phased-in 2017 requirements at the consolidated level and at more than 90% at the bank level, which is well ahead of the 80% phased-in 2015 requirement and are well positioned to achieve the 2017 requirement. We turn to Slide 7 on net interest income, our net interest income on an FTE basis was $9.9 billion down from the third quarter of '14 as a result of the more negative market related adjustment I mentioned a moment ago, which also drove a reported net interest yield decline of 11 basis points. Lower long-term rates coupled with the flattened yield curves resulted in adjustments to our assumptions to our bond premium amortizations, which drove the $578 million of market related adjustments in the fourth quarter versus the negative $55 million we saw during the third quarter of '14. We adjust this market related adjustment NII was $10.4 billion and declined less than $100 million from the third quarter of '14 despite the challenging rate environment we saw during the fourth quarter. The adjusted NII decline was driven by the impacts of the lower discretionary loan balances within the consumer real estate portfolio. If we look at net interest yield on an adjusted basis it was up a touch from the third quarter of 2014 to 2.3%. Given the movement lowering rates that we saw during the quarter, we did become more asset-sensitive touched at 100 basis point parallel increase in rates from what we saw at the end of the year we\u2019d be expected to contribute roughly $3.7 billion in NII benefits over the course of the next 12 months. And given the boom in rates the sensitivity is now more evenly weighted to both long-term, as well as short-term rate moves. Before we leave this slide I do want to remind you that during the first quarter of '15 we have two fewer interest accrual days than the fourth quarter of '14 which will negatively impact NII by a couple of $100 million. Non-interest expense and then moving to Slide 8 was 14.2 billion in the fourth quarter of '14 and included approximately $400 million in litigation expense. As I said earlier, this is the lowest quarterly expense amount that we have reported since the Merrill Lynch merger. We exclude litigation, total expenses were 13.8 billion which declined 300 million from the third quarter of '14 and was driven by our LAS initiative cost savings, as well as lower revenue related incentive costs within our global markets business. We compare these expenses to the fourth quarter of 2013, we were down $1.2 billion driven by LAS cost savings, new BAC benefits and to a lesser degree the lower revenue related incentives. Legacy assets and servicing costs ex-litigation were 1.1 billion in the quarter, 200 million lower than the third quarter and 700 million lower than the fourth quarter of 2013. As we continue to work through these delinquent loans, we expect these quarterly costs will come down a few $100 million more by the end of 2015. Headcount was down 5,800 during the quarter and as we look at expense a reminder, that we will record our normal annual retirement eligible incentive cost in the first quarter of 2015 and we expect that number to be roughly $1 billion consistent with what we\u2019ve seen in the past couple of years. We turn to asset quality on Slide 9, that quality continue to improve during the quarter Q4 provision expense was $219 million and we relived the net 660 million of reserves given the continued pace of asset quality improvement particularly within our consumer real estate portfolio. Reported charge-offs were 879 million and declined from the third quarter of 2014. I would remind you both periods of net charge-offs included NPL sales and not their recoveries and the fourth quarter included approximately 150 million of cost related to actions that were taking in relation to our DOJ settlement which we\u2019re previously reserved for. If we exclude the recoveries in the DOJ component charge-offs in the fourth quarter were just over $1 billion versus a similarly adjusted net charge-off amount of 1.2 billion in the third quarter of '14. Loss rate on the same adjusted basis were 47 basis points in the fourth quarter of '14 versus 52 basis points that we saw in the third quarter of '14. Let\u2019s now move to the business segment results which we start on Slide 10 with consumer and business banking. Our results within consumer and business banking shows solid bottom-line performance with earnings of $1.8 billion, those were down from the fourth quarter of '13 due largely to lower release of loan loss reserves and to a lesser degree higher tax rates. Business generated a solid 24% return on allocated capital during the quarter. Revenue was up slightly on a year-over-year basis despite net interest income being down as our non-interest income grew more than 5% with a strong improvement in card income. We look at customer activity during the quarter, we had solid deposit growth and our rates paid is now at 5 basis points. Loans on a linked quarter basis increased seasonally, driven by U.S. consumer credit card, our card issuance remains very strong at 1.2 million new cards in the fourth quarter of '14 of which approximately 67% of those were issued to existing customers. We look at all of 2014, we issued 15% more cards in '14 than '13, and increased the percentage of the issuance to our existing customers which is consistent with the overall strategy. Credit quality improved again as our U.S. credit card loss rate fell to 2.7% and continues to have a very strong risk adjusted margin at just below 10%. Our Merrill Edge brokerage assets grew $114 billion which is up 18% year-over-year on new accounts, strong accounts flows as well as higher market levels. Our mobile banking customers reached 16.5 million in the fourth quarter and now 12% of all customer deposit transactions are done through mobile devices. We adjust for portfolio divestitures combined debit and credit purchase volume was up 4% relative to the fourth quarter of '13 and if we back fuel up it was up 5%. Move to consumer real estate services on the Slide 11, the improvement in the results compared to the third quarter of '14 was driven by the third quarter of '14 DOJ settlements which impacted expense, provision as well as income tax. Revenues did increase slightly over the third quarter of '14, while expense even after we exclude litigation declined from the third quarter as both the former cost on the production side and cost on the delinquent loan servicing side were down from the third quarter. Core production revenue and servicing fees were both stable compared to the third quarter of '14, while servicing income did benefit from better MSR hedging results. On the production front, first mortgage retail originations were stable with the third quarter of '14 at 11.6 billion and the pipeline was consistent with the third quarter of '14 as well, albeit up on a year-over-year basis. On home equity, we\u2019re the number one lender in line originations during the quarter with 3.4 billion in line with the third quarter of '14 and up north of 70% on a year-over-year basis. The credit quality of those second-lien originations remains very strong with average cycle scores over 790 in combined loan-to-value ratios at less than 60%. Expenses in the segment did include 262 million if litigation cost in the fourth quarter versus 5.3 billion that we saw in the third quarter of '14. We continue to work through and resolve RMBS securities litigation matters including this quarter the FHLB of San Francisco matter. With the resolution of that we now estimate that we\u2019ve resolved approximately 98% of the unpaid principal balance of all RMBS as to which RMBS securities litigation has been filed or threatened against all Bank of America related entities. LAS expense ex-litigation this quarter was just over 1.1 billion, as we achieved our first quarter of 2015 goal a quarter ahead of schedule. Importantly, the number of 60 plus days delinquent loans that we have dropped to 189,000 units which is down 32,000 or 14% from the third quarter of 2014. We turn to Slide 12, global wealth and investment management delivered another strong quarter. Pre-tax was strong, net income was just over 700 million, but was down from the fourth quarter of '13 and solid fee-based growth was offset by lower net interest income and higher expense. Record asset management fees offsets the weakness we saw in transactional activity and still drove a 7% increase in non-interest revenue relative to the fourth quarter of '13. Our asset management fees now represents 45% of revenue within the segment up from 40% a year ago. Non-interest expense did increase from the fourth quarter of '13 as a result of higher performance-based incentives, as well as increased support cost. We increased the number of financial advisors in year-to-date retention of our experienced financial advisors remains at record levels. Return on allocated capital was 23%. Client balances were nearly 2.5 trillion, up 36 billion from the third quarter of '14 and were driven by strong client balance inflows. Long-term AUM flows were $9 billion for the quarter and represented the 22nd consecutive quarter of positive flows. Our record loan flows during the quarter reflect 3 billion in growth over the third quarter of '14 in securities space as well as residential mortgage lending. And our period end deposits were up 7 billion or 3% from the third quarter of 2014. If we turn to Slide 13, global banking earnings for the quarter were 1.4 billion, up from the fourth quarter of '13 on lower credit cost and to a lesser degree, reduced expenses. Results were partially -- the net income was partially offset during the quarter on a year-over-year basis by lower investment banking fees off of what was a record level in the fourth quarter of '13. Return on allocated capital was strong at 18%. We look at the investment banking revenues of north of $1.5 billion, we feel very good about the results, they were up on a linked quarter basis, and our investment banking team executed very well in a tough distribution environment given the volatility of rates as well as energy prices. Provision was a slight benefit in the quarter and reflected continued low loss rates in a small reserve release compared to the year ago period which included a reserve addition of $434 million. If we look at the balance sheet would point to two average loans, were 271 billion up 3.7 billion from the third quarter of 2014 levels. If we switch to global markets on Slide 14, the business reported a modest loss in the quarter but that did include a $497 million charge to implement FVA. For those unfamiliar with FVA, funding valuation adjustment is an adjustment to the fair value of uncollateralized derivative trades to account for the present value of funding cost. This is an accounting practice many of our peers have also adopted and as you all know this is a one-time transition cost for implementation. Separately net DVA for the quarter was a loss of 130 million versus a loss of 617 million during the fourth quarter of '13. Earnings are down from the fourth quarter of '13 as a result of a decline in sales and trading revenue that was mostly offset by decline in expense. If you recall on our fourth quarter '13 call fixed sales and trading during that quarter included 220 million in recoveries on legacy positions in the fourth quarter of '13. Sales and trading adjusting for net DVA and FVA were $2.4 billion in the fourth quarter of '14 versus 2.8 billion in the fourth quarter of '13 after we adjust for the recoveries. On the same adjustment basis fixed sales and trading revenues of $1.5 billion compare to $1.9 billion in the year ago period. December results were particularly challenging during the quarter with the toughest areas of performance being the credit sensitive businesses within FICC most notably mortgages and credit trading which are generally our largest trading revenue related businesses. On the positive side, we saw increases in both FX in rates revenues versus the prior year that were driven by increased volatility given global deflationary expectations leading to the U.S. dollar strengthening. Equity sales and trading was up modestly from the fourth quarter of '13 as increased volatility was a positive for secondary flows across both our cash and derivative trading businesses. On the expense front, the decline reflects litigation expense of 655 million in the fourth quarter of '13. If we take that litigation expense out, expenses still declined 5% from the fourth quarter of '13 as the incentives were reduced to align with the revenue performance that we saw. On Slide 15, all other, the results in the fourth quarter of '13 reflect lower revenue from NII largely associated with the market related adjustments that we\u2019ve discussed, as well as lower securities gained and equity investment income partially offset by gains on the sale of certain loans with long-term standby agreements that were converted to securities. Significant equity investment income is largely a thing of the past for us as we\u2019ve reduced the size of the principle investing positions in the business, as well as strategic positions and should be modeled accordingly. You\u2019ll also notice we took additional reserves to the payment protection insurance, but at a lower level than we saw during the third quarter of 2014. Our fourth quarter 2014 expense is down year-over-year on less non-mortgage litigation expense and lower infrastructure costs. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 29% and I would expect the tax rate for the company in 2015 to be in the low 30s absent any unusual items. One other thing I want to mention before wrapping up is some movement in our business lines that you\u2019ll see as we report them to you in 2015. In the first quarter of '15 we expect to align business banking into our global banking business which takes this more commercial business out of our core consumer and business banking unit. In addition, we expect to move the home loans portion of our consumer real estate services business to consumer banking as this product remains integral to their relationships with us. So, to conclude my comments as we look at both 2014 and the fourth quarter of '14, capital and liquidity reached record levels, which provides a solid base to support our businesses that hold leading or top-tier positions in the industry. We continue our focus on expense and operating leverage after reaching significant milestones this year on both new BAC, as well as LAS cost saving initiatives. We reported a quarter of much lower legacy assets and servicing, operating and litigation costs, which have been burdening our reported results. Asset quality continues its trend of improvement against the slowly improving U.S. macroeconomic backdrop and we continue to remain well positioned to benefit in an environment where rates starts to increase. And with that we\u2019ll go ahead and open it up for questions. Question-and: Operator : (Operator Instructions) We could take our first question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Betsy Graseck : I just want to talk a little bit about the asset sensitivity and how we should be thinking about that from here in particular as long end of the curve has come down since the end of this quarter, so just wanted to understand is that FAS 91 effect to the day given what the long end of the curve has done? And then maybe just to speak to what you\u2019re doing to trying to minimize any further pressure? Brian Moynihan : A couple of things, so if you follow us Betsy we\u2019ve historically have been saying that the 100 basis points is in the $3.1 billion to $3.2 billion range and think of the increase to 3.7 more or less just representing the recapturing of the FAS 91, that we saw this quarter and that\u2019s why we referenced that there has been more asset sensitivity on the long side, the short-end side really hasn\u2019t changed at all. Betsy Graseck : Sure and then given the fact that the tenure is now yielding like 1.8 or so, should we assume like if we end the quarter in 1Q at 1.8 that the same type of 10 basis points down drives FAS 91 effect it\u2019s the same in the first quarter as it was in the fourth quarter or is it because you\u2019re more asset sensitive there is a little bit higher impact? Brian Moynihan : That\u2019s a good question I think when we looked at this last night that the movement that we\u2019ve seen in so far in the first quarter of '15 is almost identical to what we saw during the fourth quarter so if you were to snap it off of what we saw last night it would be a comparable type number realizing we stopped 2.5 months ago. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And is there any give backs in refi activities that you\u2019re expecting? Brian Moynihan : Yes, it says here if we look at, we referenced if refi activity increased as a percentage of overall mortgage production in the fourth quarter and as I have said in my prepared remarks if we look at the pipelines and compare the mortgage pipeline at year-end relative to the comparable period, it\u2019s up pretty significantly and we\u2019ll just have to see how that plays out realizing that the first quarter does tend to be a little bit seasonally slow. Bruce Thompson : The other thing Betsy is that it has been in January if HSN starts moving and the amount of applications coming in have fairly started the upward move due to this last refi so, as those things close through we\u2019d expect to see some pick up in production this quarter from the refi. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein. Go ahead please. John McDonald : Hi Bruce, just wanted to follow-up on the NII, on the core side of NIIX ex the FAS 91 your core NII held up well despite what you had indicated in October about kind of being conservative with the buy ticket. I guess how does you kind of hold the core end on NII and how are you navigating that now and what feels like a even more difficult environment for kind of reinvesting cash flows today with the tenure where it is? Bruce Thompson : Sure, that\u2019s a good question John, there are a couple of things, the first is if you look at the quarter I think we did a good job with respect to the overall debt footprint which was down $7 billion which helped us out a little bit. Secondly, if you look at we were able to get another basis point out on the deposit front and throughout the quarter we saw some loan growth that was a little bit better than what we would have seen when we spoke to you during the quarter. The other thing that we did see during the quarter is we were able to invest and get some of the investments in the portfolio and I believe it was a mid-November when rates did back up and as we go forward we do have liquidity to invest in the second and third months of the quarter and we\u2019ll be prudent with how we invest it relative to OCI risk. The other thing I would say just before we leave this John that I should have referenced with Betsy\u2019s point is that, it\u2019s easy to focus on the FAS 91 because we resetting the amortization of premium, and the other thing you need to realize is that we did see in the quarter is with the rate movement up while you do have a negative on FAS 91 you\u2019ve got a significant positive from a capital perspective where OCI in the quarter from the rate movement was north of $3 billion. John McDonald : So on the core piece Bruce, do you expect to be more challenging to kind of hold in to that 104 with the tenure where it is, does it make it more difficult and how should we think about the rest of the 104 if rates stay low? Bruce Thompson : Well I think as I said in my comments the 104 you really need to start out at about 102 because you\u2019ve got two less days during the quarter. And I\u2019d say that there is a little bit of headwind to hold that on a core basis and we\u2019re obviously doing everything we can to keep it as close to 102 as we can, realizing that we\u2019re not going to take outsized OCI risk. John McDonald : Okay. And then shipping gears on expenses you got the LAS target a quarter at a time, do you have a year-end target I think you said you expect to continue to reduce the LAS to 1.1, could you just clarify that? Bruce Thompson : I think as we look out and we look at the plans and actions along with the progress that we\u2019ve made on the 60 plus day delinquency I think broadly speaking as you know this number can bounce around a little bit but we\u2019d look to have the LAS expenses down to the $800 million type area by the end of the year and we\u2019re obviously working through plans as we look out to 2016 to continue to drive that number south of 800 million as we go forward. John McDonald : Okay. And how should we think about kind of core rest of Bank of America expenses where you came in nicely at the 127 for the fourth quarter obviously you mentioned the stock option expense stuff in the first quarter, but as we think about 2015 what are you hoping to do on the core expense space? Brian Moynihan : John I think it probably is sort of about a broad level and Bruce can touch in, so if you think about in the fourth quarter a couple of things happened, one is, you have to remember margins for the investment was down so be careful not to forget as we see it coming back this quarter and expect it to rise as it just did in the first quarter that would be a increased expense which you should want obviously. And the rest of it is basically a continuous process of taking out expenses and bringing the bottom-line of reinvest growth so to give you a straightforward way in the fourth quarter the reduction headcount of approximately 5,000, and 1,100 or so was LAS and the rest was core activity we will just be growing down expense base at the same time we have added sales people during that quarter. So what we\u2019re trying to do is ideally we wouldn\u2019t expect it to fall dramatically, but I\u2019d expect you guys to be able to see us continuing to make strong investments in sales capacity, technology, products while holding expenses relatively flat with a slight down or biased irrespective of you just got to be careful of the compensation related to revenue because we don\u2019t want that to be higher. Operator : And our next question will come from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead. Brennan Hawken : So in FICC it seems a little bit below what certainly what I was looking for and I know you highlighted some of the difficult markets that you\u2019re large in, was there any specific positional pain given what we saw in some of the credit spreads and some of the movements there? Bruce Thompson : No, not at all, just to go back to the core premise that we talk about which is that the banking and markets businesses are run as an integrated business and a lot of the activity that we see within the markets area is in market making and other things that are done off of the new issue platform from an underwriting perspective and I think what we saw during the quarter particularly in December was that there was a significant slowdown as we saw overall volatility in the markets from both a new issue, as well as a secondary market perspective that flow through but there were not any, if you look here there were no losses or particular pain points within the global markets piece of the equation during the quarter. Brennan Hawken : And then can you guys add any comment to the press reports we have seen about you\u2019re rationalizing the PB business and cutting ties to 150(h)(1) class? Bruce Thompson : Well, I think this is a customer profitability exercise. As we look at driving the franchise Tom and Syed Mateen have done a good job repositioning the equities business. We had the constrain of prime brokerage a bit due to size, because of the flow of balance sheet return as you\u2019d be aware of, but importantly it\u2019s the customer profitability we are looking for customers who will use this with multiple products and services what is fixed income equities all that there is a fixed income and so as we take this cash resource which is the GAAP balance sheet and the RWA balance sheet and allocate it across customers we\u2019ve got extra rate returns and this was the natural question. Brennan Hawken : Should we expect to think about some revenue headwinds in your equities business as we model out 2015, as a result of some of those efforts? Bruce Thompson : No it\u2019s all pretty much through it right now and as you look at the revenue sort of quarter-to-quarter run plus or minus $1 billion and Syed Mateen has done a good job of increasing the yields from the other clients at the same time. So that I would, absent market forces are just I wouldn\u2019t expect that much an effect. Brennan Hawken : Then helpful to hear about the target of around $800 million for LAS by year-end and then driving it lower in 2016. Can you help us think about how you think about that number to zero? Because I mean, ultimately, that's -- given the title, the L in the LAS, right? That's got to go to zero eventually. How should we think about that? Bruce Thompson : Well we have got several and in there and so there is all the servicing expense in the company is in that unit well good loans and bad loans, so it doesn\u2019t go to zero but it\u2019s got to get a lot better at this. If you start to move on to 4 million or so units we have in first mortgage servicing and think about the annualized cost we have got to get us down significantly may be servicing and mortgages make sense to us and so, but that\u2019s a project that we\u2019re working against doing it the right way for the customer, doing it the right way for the regulatory environment and the consent orders and all the things that have gone on as you are aware and so we just got to keep feeling out a way. So when we say 800 or so that is the next way station on our train right here, but it\u2019s got to go a lot further than that for the 3.5 million to 4 million the good units we have so to speak. Brennan Hawken : Okay. So no indication about where that settling-out level might ultimately be even if not a win, but kind of what the number would be? Brian Moynihan : Well, I think the Bruce talked about a half billion but I am not sure that\u2019s a great performance not overtime either. So just assume that there is nothing more interesting than driving that number down to a normalized servicing cost than this company. Brennan Hawken : And then last one for me, you guys hit on in the wealth management business and the margin there support cost and revenue related comp, could you maybe quantify how much each of those factors impacted the margin change quarter-over-quarter? Bruce Thompson : Yes I think if you look at the a couple of things, the first is that from a margin perspective you had a little bit of headwind with NII being lower than what it was, but I would -- as you look at the support cost during the quarter I would think about is being about 200 basis points on the margin during the quarter that we saw. Operator : Our next question will come from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Glenn Schorr : I wonder if we could get your best comment that you can give us on energy-related exposures. In your Q you have a general comment on energy and $20 billion. But if you could break it down a little bit more, what's secured, what's not secured, what's investment grade, what's not, and just how overall you feel your position there -- it would be helpful? Bruce Thompson : I think if we look at the amount of funded exposure across what we referred to as oil and gas, the amount of funded exposure which includes derivative exposure was roughly $23 billion at the end of the year. As you look at that 23 billion, I would think of it generally as 60% that\u2019s directly reflected or affected by the price of oil, there are a lot of those that have not so you have got roughly $22 billion, $23 billion funded 60% directly affected by oil well north of 80% of that are investment grade borrowers and for those non-investment grade borrowers there are obviously secured facilities and in most cases have formulas upon which they can borrow based on the value of the assets that were secured by. Brian Moynihan : I think if you think overall and one of the things that to give a perspective that we see is in the consumer spending in January on debit and credit cards basically, we\u2019ve seen the spend go up by 3% and if you look at these fuel side of that it\u2019s about 5% of that total spending and it is down 28% year-over-year. So the people are getting a benefit that our consumer customers are getting benefit but the re-spending that benefit and overall thing those are growing through it. So, they are competing -- there is a technical risk for the oil producing companies that Bruce have talked you through, but the overall economy even the first week or so January we\u2019re seeing the benefit of the consumer very historically when the year-over-year compares. Glenn Schorr : I definitely appreciate all that. You said that was the funded to oil and gas, is commitments a larger number, I think, than that? And do you have the ability to pull back on the commitments? Bruce Thompson : Well I think on average the fundings are roughly 50% of what the commitments are, as it relates to the pulling back of commitments I think what I would point to and what our teams did a very good job with is we obviously have commitments in the originate to distribute piece which if we look at we ended the year I believe with two commitments of investment grade borrowers on an originate and distribute basis one of which has had a significant positive event from a financing perspective already this year, the others are single A credit that will get done in the second quarter and at outside of the investment grade originate to distribute. I think there was a couple 100 million dollars that still needed to get done. So you\u2019re not pulling commitments from borrowers but as it relates to commitments that needed to be distributed the teams have done a very good job. Glenn Schorr : Okay. I don't want to put words in your mouth, but it sounds like you are semi-comfortable with the positioning. There will be some hits along the way, but this is not a major risk to the portfolio? Again, I don't want to put words in your mouth? Bruce Thompson : We\u2019re comfortable with the positions, you should assume as we\u2019re making these commitments in environments where oil is higher, we\u2019re continually running and stressing those portfolios to be comfortable with the commitments. And as Brian referenced to the extent that that were in a prolonged period, where these prices persist to the extent that there are cost that run through because of difficulties that a commercial or corporate borrower may have that as we look across the overall credit platform, you\u2019d expect there to be offsets given what we\u2019re seeing with consumers and other people that are benefiting from lower energy prices. Glenn Schorr : Okay, that's helpful. Last one from me is I didn't hear anything on TLAC. If you could tell us where you think your ratio shook out, net of the conservation buffer and the SIFI buffer, that would be helpful? Bruce Thompson : Yes I think if you look at where we are from a TLAC perspective we\u2019re generally in the 21% type area and embedded in that 21% type area is the fact that that structured note we\u2019ve assumed for that purpose that we would not benefit from structured note funding and if we refinance out those structured note to pick up another 1% to 2% based on the current size of that footprint. Glenn Schorr : Okay. I just want to make sure : the 21% is net of the conservation buffer and your SIFI buffer, or gross of? Bruce Thompson : No it\u2019s gross up, that\u2019s a gross up. So it\u2019s a roughly 21 call it plus, another 1 to 2 for structured notes and then depending on the exact treatment of the buffers as we go through that number would be reduced by the buffers. Operator : Our next question will come from Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Jim Mitchell : Just a quick question on the balance sheet and NII, I appreciate the efforts to keep NIM flat; but to really get NII growing, we've got to start to see, I guess, the balance sheet on a net basis grow. I think your balance sheet was down close to $25 billion this quarter. At what point do we start to see the net balance sheet -- the restructuring of the balance sheet start to give way to growth? Bruce Thompson : I think what you didn\u2019t see there as we go forward is that we look out into our forecast and models, we would expect there to continue to be strong deposit growth throughout 2015 and as we referenced before obviously the goal with that deposit growth is very much a focus to grow loans within our core customer segments. And as I referenced we saw that within the global banking space this quarter, we saw it within wealth management, we\u2019re seeing pickups in overall mortgage activity. So I think you are likely to see the balance sheet creep up as deposits come in and as we look to grow loans, I just want to make sure though that we remind you that we will continue to see these discretionary portfolio that\u2019s got whole loans in it that in this rate environment they will continue to repay, so you judge how we do on loan growth you need to look at the core businesses. As I said we would expect to start to see the balance sheet move up and at the same time we\u2019re trying to get things that don\u2019t have a return and our quarter what we do off but to your point I think we\u2019re largely through that. Brian Moynihan : And I think if you think about it say two years ago I think we sighted about 100 odd billion dollars of non-core loans that\u2019s done under 30, and a dominant part of that is still in the home equity area quite frankly. So in the card business and the business banking area where we had some stuff that\u2019s pronounced by the predecessor company that we\u2019re largely through all that and that\u2019s why you\u2019re seeing some growth there and then so the card you saw grow its seasonal that it grew and it\u2019s been stable for a number of quarters. The home equity side is growing quite strongly this stuff and home equity stuff high charge off contents to better decision economics of the company to run it. But the rest of the loan balance is we ought to see growth, with the exception of the sort of discretionary residential mortgage holdings which will continue to run down based on better view of what we want to do for management going forward. Jim Mitchell : And I think to your point sort of the deleveraging around China improve the leverage ratio as the impact of that should be easing going forward? Brian Moynihan : That\u2019s correct. Jim Mitchell : Okay. And just one last, a follow-up on -- I don't know if you mentioned this : where you guys are in the NSFR? Brian Moynihan : Yes we\u2019ve done a lot of work, we\u2019ve not put anything out public on that but as we\u2019ve looked through it and sort of we do not see that being a constrain as we go forward. Operator : And our next question will come from Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Matt O\u2019Connor: The capital ratios grew more than expected. Obviously the decline in rates helped the positive earnings, and you mentioned the DTA consumption. As we think about 2015 and the drivers of capital, is it more of the same? Or is there, call it, optimization overall? Not just the loan runoff that you address, but as we think about -- you've had Final Rules for the last few months; there are still some adjustments to the business throughout. How should we think about the capital build? And if you have an estimate for 2015, that would be interesting as well? Bruce Thompson : Sure, we\u2019re not going to provide an estimate but what I\u2019d say is that as you look at overall capital levels, if you start with the numerator, as we project out and look at the earnings stream, we think that at least through '15 and possibly into the first part of '16 that on average you can have some quarterly bounces around based on timing and payments but that generally we should accrete capital over the course of at least four and up to six quarters largely based on the pre-tax earnings for the company as oppose to the after-tax earnings and that\u2019s what you saw during the fourth quarter. The other thing numerator as I referenced that, there is if we were to snap a quarter today there would be OCI benefit from the downward movement in rates, as it relates to what we\u2019re seeing under risk weighted asset side, I\u2019d say generally we continue to benefit although it declines a little bit each period. We continue to benefit from the run off of some of the global markets position that would have been put on in the 2005 to 2008 time frame that they tended to have tenures of seven to 10 years. In addition to that as we continue to have payoffs and as we continue to move out some of the comfort consumer real estate assets and put higher quality real estate assets on that are better credit borrowers while the asset levels may stay comparable, you do have an RWA pick up from that as well. Matt O\u2019Connor: On RWA, any numbers you can provide in terms of how much benefit you get from them, I guess just priced on the credit correlation book and some of those contracts and the real estate running off, just those two pieces? Bruce Thompson : No I mean I think as you look forward I mean these tend to be I think outside of op-risk this quarter, we had roughly $30 billion of risk weighted asset benefit under the advanced approach roughly half of that was in the consumer book, half of that was in the wholesale books. I think you will continue to see benefits but I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll see the quarterly benefit of that magnitude on a go forward basis. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay. Then just separately, the home equity charge-offs increased a fair amount versus 3Q. Obviously, 3Q is a very low level. But remind me what's going on there. I think there was an accounting or methodology change a year ago. Has that fully worked through or is there seasonality or -- what's going on? Bruce Thompson : Yes, the biggest thing you have in home equity this quarter is that I believe it was roughly $150 million that went through charge off that was related to the DOJ settlement so realize we have of 150 charge off, 150 of reserve so from a net P&L perspective it was a push but you did have that during the quarter and it\u2019s the reason that we wanted to give you the core charge off number Q3 to Q4 because as we implement the DOJ settlement, you will see both charge off and reserve release come out in each of probably the first and second quarter then we should be largely through that. Operator : And we will take our next question from Steven Chubak with Nomura. Please go ahead. Steven Chubak : Bruce, I was hoping you could maybe help explain what prompted the increase in operational risk RWA? The 34% I guess makes you an outlier relative to some of your peers, whereas previously you were more in line. I know the process typically is you submit the models to the regulators and/or the Fed and then they give you feedback. I wanted to know : was the increase prompted by the feedback from the regulators themselves as part of the annual review? Or was it what you determined based on your own internal models? Bruce Thompson : Answer the question slightly differently which is that, as we work through an interim process with our regulatory supervisors, we do believe at this point that from an op-risk perspective that we\u2019re adjusted and the amount of op-risk RWA that we have now is consistent with what you would need to exit parallel run. Steven Chubak : Okay, understood. So we shouldn't expect any further increases as a percentage of RWA going forward; or is it simply too early to make that determination? Bruce Thompson : We think with respect to op-risk RWA that we\u2019re there we obviously need to get through those elements that are rest of parallel run but from an perspective we feel like we\u2019re there. Steven Chubak : Okay. That's really great. Then just one more quick one for me. I didn't hear in the prepared remarks any color on the investment banking backlog and didn't know if you can give us an update there as well? Bruce Thompson : Yes, it\u2019s interesting and we\u2019ve to be a little bit careful I\u2019d say as we looked at the backlog and the pipeline particularly from an M&A perspective that we feel very good about where the pipeline was at year-end, the part of the stronger year-end pipeline that we have the only tone of caution I would say is that we\u2019ve obviously seen a little bit more volatility in both the fixed income and equity of new issue markets but it relate to the amount of business that we\u2019re winning it\u2019s getting queued up in the pipeline we feel very good about that it was a good backlog at year-end. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim. Please go ahead. Eric Wasserstrom : I just wanted to follow-up on a couple of topics that have been touched on already. Maybe just starting with the risk-weighted asset discussion once more, I just want to make sure I understand all the puts and takes of what's going into the risk-weighted asset calc. It sounds like on the positive side, obviously, there is the benefit of a GAAP balance sheet reduction as well as the trade-off between lower-quality and higher-quality assets. And it sounds like the operating-risk component is now fully baked in. But are there any other components that could drive that up in a way that's different from what's going on, on the GAAP balance sheet? Bruce Thompson : I think the only thing that\u2019s out there is that is as part of exiting parallel run we\u2019re working through with our supervisors that the different wholesale and other credit models that you need to exit parallel run so we\u2019re working through that but I think absent that you\u2019re largely at the point of looking at and you\u2019d expect that the RWA is going to largely follow the GAAP balance sheet. The one thing I think you all know this but where you could possible diverge from that is that there is pro cyclicality to the extent that you have volatility in the markets businesses as it relates to the stress bar calculations that go into the risk weighted asset but outside of that you\u2019d directionally expect it to follow the GAAP balance sheet. Eric Wasserstrom : Okay. And with respect to the GAAP balance sheet, what is your overall expectation about the net growth over '15? Bruce Thompson : I think you are probably going to largely see it in the zip code and probably be most correlated to the overall deposit balances and if you look at the range that we\u2019ve been running at over the last 12 months it\u2019s been in the 2.1 to 2.15, 2.175 type area and I\u2019d expect that area or that range to hold for 2015. Eric Wasserstrom : Great. Then just to talk about the asset quality for a moment, obviously it was the lowest provision that we've seen from you in some time; and many of your peers are inflecting from the point of asset quality improvements to some modest now deterioration and the rebuilding of reserves. I just want to get a sense from you about where you think you are in that spectrum? Bruce Thompson : Sure, I think if we go back and let\u2019s start with the fact that we saw during the quarter that if we back out any impact of loan sales as well as the DOJ settlement charge-offs in the fourth quarter came down from $1.2 billion to just over $1 million I think as you look at charge-offs when you\u2019re virtually zero from a commercial perspective it\u2019s hard to see getting much better than that. I do think where we\u2019re probably a little bit different is that as we continue to work through and we had another solid improvement of a $2 billion from an NPL perspective within the consumer real estate space that we continue to work through and reduce those tougher consumer real estate credits, but I think that if you look at this $1 billion charge-off type level that we\u2019ve seen you\u2019re probably -- probably areas where you\u2019re going to see that flatten out and I think as we look forward there maybe a little bit reserve release on the first half of the year and you probably expect that to flatten out and go away as we get through 2015. Eric Wasserstrom : Great. Then just finally on the LAS expense, which I know you've touched on several times, but I'm just wondering if the pace of that improvement changes at all as you are getting into the later stages of the delinquency and foreclosure inventory improvement? Bruce Thompson : Yes, it does that and the plus side is that you would have ability to push the numbers down faster the economy continues to improve and the market continues to improve and the opportunities for borrowers and time passes, frankly. The flip side of that though, is in the states that -- in the areas where the process is slow sort of boiling the beaker and what is left is in the really slow areas and so we\u2019ve sort of caught up in the states where our progress goes through a reasonable fashion and we\u2019re still have the laggards in places that the process is traditionally oriented. So I think you're absolutely right. There is a buyer that get better at it and get lower as it starts improving but against that you get to the some of the rocks they are hard to move because the process is so slow. Secondly if you remember we had, we took up on 58,000 employees in that business and there is a lag to getting the real estate cost out and letting of buildings and all the stuff we had that is still until we got to be little careful getting ahead ourselves I think will come down first facility then come out second and so we are working hard on that so you're right that once see the improve the phase-in improvement continues almost normally or even normally better than past, but there is something that where we get there in terms of that is much harder and then secondly there is like for the hard cost over and above people cost. Operator : We can take our next question from Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead. Guy Moszkowski : I just want to go back to the net interest margin discussion a little bit. I thought that I heard you say in the prepared comments that there had been a shift in the balance of the asset sensitivity to more of a balance between long-term versus short-term rates. I was wondering if that is strictly a function of the FAS 91 issue in a falling long-rate environment. Or is there something more structural that you've been doing with the portfolio that has caused that to happen? Bruce Thompson : It's the FAS 91, Guy you are absolutely correct. Guy Moszkowski : Okay. Then if we can just take a look at that one historically for a second, obviously over time that has caused quite a lot more volatility in your NIMs than it has for a lot of the peer group. I seem to remember that for regional banks, say, that have often had the same issue, there is a difference, I guess, in the way they accrue versus doing the constant resets that you do. And I was wondering why you do it in the way that you do, which seems to create more volatility. Bruce Thompson : We probably wondered the same thing this quarter. All we can say, if you go back, you are right there are two ways that you can do this that the first is the way that we do it which is you have the premium, you look at the average life of the premium in each quarter you reset it and basically retroactively make that adjustment from when it started and that was determination that we have made a number of years ago. But you're right, the other way that has allowed and provided for under GAAP is that you just basically adjust as you grow and take it through the P&L as you go and you can do it either of two ways and we obviously do it the way that we do. Guy Moszkowski : Would you ever consider changing that? And if you were to do so, would there be a significant one-time charge that would be associated with that? Bruce Thompson : No, I think it goes the other way the reality is that we run through the P&L that amortization to catch up in effective way ended up being lower than when the premium was set on. So, I think the way that we do it is absolutely appropriate and keep in mind, the other thing and I reference in my earlier comment is that, as you do this from a balance sheet perspective you're always adjusting the valuation of your AFS securities to be the fair market value at the time that you publish your financials and obviously that flows through our CI. Guy Moszkowski : Yes, fair enough. You also talked about changing line items or lines of business, where certain things are booked, as we move into 2015. That was fairly clear, except I was wondering : will this also entail moving the very large investment portfolio of your mortgages from all other into the Consumer category? Bruce Thompson : It will not result in a large portion of mortgages being moved. There may be a smaller amount or a percentage of it that we continue to evaluate because the one thing that we want to make sure that we do is to have the geography of the financial statements motivate the behavior of the people that serve the client base that they do. So there maybe possibly a relatively small amount of home equity loans that could travel into the consumer business, but it's not going to be anything that the storage things in many meaningful way. Guy Moszkowski : Then final one for me, you talked a little bit about the Investment Banking backlog at the turn of the year. But more broadly for Global Markets and Global Banking taken together, can you give us a sense -- now that we're a couple weeks into the year -- how the, in particular say, trading activity has started off? And given some of the increase in volatility, especially with big moves like what happened with the Swiss franc today, are you instructing the Global Markets business to pull back on risk? Or generally are you seeing that some of those volatility levels are in some way beneficial? Bruce Thompson : I think there is a couple of part to that. The first is I think if you look at overall risk levels that we ran within the global markets business and if you look at our information that we put out at year-end that even with the little bit of the pickup in volatility at year-end borrows it low levels and overall balance sheet levels where at low levels as we exited the year and I think with nine trading days into the quarter. So, I think it's a little bit early to forecast what you\u2019d expect for the quarter for the overall sales and trading businesses. The only thing I would say is that clearly the activity levels that we\u2019ve seen -- that have spend more way return to normal than what we experience in the month of December. But I wouldn\u2019t want anyone to draw any conclusions -- nine days, through 62 trading days in a quarter. Operator : And we can go next to Paul Miller with FBR. Please go ahead. Paul Miller : Thank you very much, and most of the questions has been answered. But on your legacy assets -- and you talked about this a little bit, where your default numbers have dropped roughly to 189,000 from roughly I think 220,000. Did you sell anything? Or is that all improvement in just credit in the quarter? In other words, did you move the houses out, or did you also sell? Bruce Thompson : My recollection is there was roughly a third of that came from the sales of both servicing as well as the underlying loans themselves. And then in addition to that we saw continued improvement in net new 60 pluses and then we obviously worked others through the normal foreclosure process as well as for those borrowers that cared. Paul Miller : One of the things that -- because I -- on your -- you made a comment about that the lower oil prices has improved some of the consumer credit, consumer spending, and all that. Are you seeing any improvement in working through those 60-day defaults from that? Or those loans are just so old relatively speaking in the default bucket that the lower oil prices really doesn't help out? Bruce Thompson : It\u2019s much too early to figure out what the lower price impact would have on mortgage, you\u2019re actually seeing consumer spend the money they\u2019re getting and you\u2019re seeing the consumer credit quality stay strong that you project out a period of low prices. You would see a benefit on consumer side offset by the commercial side. So I am not sure Paul in the context 60 days bucket to impact old days. But because people that are going to [indiscernible] first mortgage portfolio they keep coming down and that\u2019s the problem of long-term reduction. Paul Miller : Brian, I missed -- I was writing it down as fast as I could, but you talked about how that you are seeing consumer balances increase over the last couple months, I guess, or last month. Can you go over those numbers again? Brian Moynihan : Consumer spending increased that is that what you are referring to Paul. So far January of 2013 versus January of 2014, spending on credit debit cards of about 3% year-over-year and that\u2019s overcoming a drag effect of about percentage and a half from lower fuel prices. Operator : And we can take our next question from Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead. Marty Mosby : I wanted to drill into the Markets business a little bit. In the sense that we've seen pressure on fixed income the last two quarters, is there anything in the drivers of that weakness that would jeopardize the seasonal uptick that we usually see in the first quarter? Brian Moynihan : I think if I understand your question, I think that the answer to that is no, if you go back and look at -- with the exception of last year the fourth quarter does tend to be the weakest quarter of the year seasonally. It was obviously a little bit more so this quarter but structurally there is nothing that would lead you to that, obviously it\u2019s a market that adds inflows but no there is not anything structural that would lead you to believe that that should be different. Marty Mosby : Then there is a lot of noise in the Markets business, and I tried to take out as much as I could. What I'm trying to look at is expense elasticity relative to the revenues. From third quarter to fourth quarter it looked very effective, was about 80% in relation to expenses to revenue reduction. But over the last year, when you take out the litigation expense, looks like operating expenses only declined about 20% of what revenues declined. So I was just curious what you thought maybe the right elasticity number would be there? Brian Moynihan : I think largely we saw in the fourth quarter was collection of the change in incentives levels due to more revenue and you\u2019d expect that to happen. But let me bring that a little higher to more broader point, which is about two years or three years ago Tom Montag and his team made a fundamental restructuring of that business to drop its expense phase to where as long as we get $2.5 billion more revenues, more or less we start making some money and if you adjust the FVA charge which is the one-time charge they made somewhere around $300 million this quarter to give you a sense. So it\u2019s the worst quarter $300 million and best quarter runs over 1 billion and that largely is really marginally profitable where you see the revenues go from the high 2 billion to the 3 billion level to the 4 billion, most of that comes through with the compensation of 19% 20% or something like that. So there is elasticity base, you get the lower level start to hit the floor on the fixed cost structure. Marty Mosby : Then Brian, lastly, you've talked several times about the core expenses and the investments you're making. A lot of the core businesses, really all except Banking, showed declines in net income sequentially and year-over-year. Do you feel like you're investing to try to reignite some of that growth going forward? Brian Moynihan : Now one of the things you got to be careful, they reflect this all these charge that we talk about and pushed out all the businesses, so there is some elements that really aren\u2019t the businesses control for a lack of a better term. And then secondly you\u2019re still seeing as we move from a period where reserve releases were going along the business level you\u2019re seeing provision changes across the board to have it. But by enlarge if you look at the fees and address expenses which is two things they control the most you see a pretty good relationship going on and pretty good stability and I\u2019d say if you look across the businesses, the consumer bank continues to make good progress on sales capabilities and if actual sales look at some of the later pages you can see it, I said wealth management, we got to make sure the expenses in the revenues stay on line there we talked about that last quarter and John Thiel and team specially at Merrill Lynch are doing good job getting after that and innovating I think you\u2019ve seen a pretty good relationship if you back out sort of the fundamental impacts of FAS 91 and the provision things like that which says those adjustments we make at the top of the house and push through. Operator : We will take our next question from Mike Mayo with CLSA, please go ahead. Mike Mayo : You highlighted that the expenses are at the lowest levels since the Merrill merger, and we estimate that they are down almost one-fourth over five years so that's certainly good. But we also note that revenues are down quite a bit over that time frame too. So how do you evaluate the trade-off between more aggressive restructuring and investing in the franchise? And specifically, you're pretty much done, I think, with New BAC. Would you have a program -- maybe Even Newer BAC, or a new restructuring plan? Brian Moynihan : Mike we\u2019ve piece of that obviously credit cost you got to think about in terms of if you look back look at the higher revenue levels at the time, the charge off run rate was $2 billion to $3 billion a quarter and one quarter was 10 billion approximately for cards especially so be careful about that but I\u2019d say your point really is what you do from now forward and we see that\u2019s we talked about in core expense space we decide the LAS litigation all that stuff it is just the core expense space basically what we continue to do is to take out non-productive expenses and the best part of that back in the franchise and bringing part of that to the ability to that core line continue to move that and that\u2019s down. Remember that when we\u2019re doing this we\u2019re absorbing housing cost increases, wage and salary increases, incentive comp increases so we\u2019re heavily focused on maintaining a rational balance between the core revenue and the core expense dynamic going forward and so you should expect to assume that to the continuous program looking at this, this is continued simplifier company could being take out divestures of the cost of the crises and as we have downsized the company takeout the overhead that was hard to shakeout as you\u2019re all aware so we\u2019re laser focused on so I think on the other hand we continue to investment sales capacity and you see that reflecting thing like card sales and home equity sales and auto loan sales, direct auto loans sales are increased. Mike Mayo : So, don\u2019t expect another new program with the expense targets is more of a day-to-day perspective now? Brian Moynihan : No, remember we absorb if you think 50% of our cost being people cost and you think of inflationary level of cost increase of the 3% on this. Basically a key cost down and flattish, you got to work your tail off and whether and that\u2019s a sort of process going forward we\u2019ve to drop a cost down again to the reasonable level, we\u2019ll continue to make improvement relative to revenues and the rules get different we\u2019ll then have to revisit it but right now in this revenue environment, the slow growth environment we can keep the cost while as revenue start to rise. Mike Mayo : Then a separate question : what are your key financial targets for 2015? I know you've expressed some of your targets, assuming interest rates increase. But if interest rates don't increase, what should investors evaluate you on at the end of 2015? All I had to go on without the higher interest rates is page 42 of the proxy that talks about the PRSUs. It says as long as you get over a 50 basis point ROA you go in the money on the PRSUs. So I'm not sure if I should be looking at the 50 basis point number, or its 80 basis points, 100% in the money, or the 1% number that you've talked about before. But again, assuming rates don't go up, what's your ROA and ROE target for 2015? Brian Moynihan : Mike, you don\u2019t get specific projections but our goal is to continue to take [indiscernible] level this quarter and driving forward and our view is that based on everything we see as we see the impact of all the work we\u2019re doing plus the rollover to cost base, the reduction of LAS cost, the litigation falling back to kinds of level you saw this quarter you do see this move towards that those long term goals of 1% ROA and 12% return of ample common equity. Mike Mayo : One last try, that 1% and 12%, that assumes higher interest rates. If your forecasts do not expect higher interest rates as soon as they do right now, at what point would you take additional action with expenses? And how do you think about that? Brian Moynihan : We take additional action expenses every afternoon. In other words we had 4,000 reductions FVA in the fourth quarter of 2014 Mike that was a core franchise to keep getting efficient. So, we work on expenses every day, and we\u2019ve teams of people working to do all things that you expect us to do. Operator : And we can take our last question from Nancy Bush with NAB Research, please go ahead. Nancy Bush : Two questions, Brian, I'm a little bit confused about the card growth. I think you said you got 1.2 million new cards out in the fourth quarter. Is that -- and didn't you mention something about it being seasonal? You've got lots of ground that you can gain in that business and I just want to clarify whether this is something extraordinary going on here and what your projections are for the future for growth there? Brian Moynihan : Yes, Nancy, sorry if we confused you let\u2019s talk about the production of new cards unit, that\u2019s the one 1.84 million to look at Page 19 you can see it building from the fourth quarter '12 830 million, 830,000 so the first is production of units and the second was balances, balances in card disrupt in the fourth quarter almost $3 billion net to $3 billion that we got to careful because Christmas people even spend on borrowing and it pay down. So the point there is that will seasonal how to -- but if you look back in prior quarters we\u2019ve seen a stability in our card balances which is continues on more units the people continue to use the card we don\u2019t expect the positive growth there. But its units 1.2 million balance is good 2.5 billion to 3 billion and the balance is [indiscernible] seasonality unit then above 1 million new production units each quarter of the last several quarters. Nancy Bush : Is there one particular card that's proving to be very popular? I see your ads for the cash-back cards, etc. Is that the card of choice at this point? Brian Moynihan : Yes, in fact that is our core card offering. We\u2019ve simplified our offering to three or four core products and that\u2019s the biggest one and it\u2019s contributing to sort of card income being up year-over-year by about 7% and so it\u2019s card selling well and the good news is we see is 67% came through basically our web online sales process and our branch sales process in the core customer so we continue to drive that. Nancy Bush : Okay. Secondly, the 25% margin in Wealth Management, I think back to the old days when you had much fatter margins in that business. What do you see as a normalized margin in Wealth Management? Number two, to what impact is the Wealth Management margin being maybe impacted by high liquidity levels that customers are maintaining? And do you see that changing? Bruce Thompson : I\u2019d say a couple of things and I think the first is that we\u2019ve said that over the course of the couple of years that we need that wealth management margin to get to 30% I think you\u2019ve got a couple of things going on right now, in the low rate environment that business has an artificial drag because as you know you don\u2019t tend to payout compensation which is a significant portion of the expense to those things that are net interest income related. So we would expect we also have in 2016 some deferred comp and other programs running off. So as we go through over the course of the next couple of years between the business growing normalization of rate environment and some other things that should be a 30% type pre-tax margin business. Brian Moynihan : I think we\u2019re through all the questions. So thank you very much for joining us and we\u2019ll look forward to speak in next quarter. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s program. Thanks for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Bernstein Steven Chubak - Nomura Ken Usdin - Jefferies Eric Wasserstrom - Guggenheim Securities Mike Mayo - CLSA Nancy Bush - NAB Research Brennan Hawken - UBS Jeff Harte - Sandler O' Neill Operator : Good day, everyone. And welcome to the Bank of America Earnings Announcement Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode, but later you\u2019ll have the opportunity to ask questions during the question-and-answer session. Please note that this call is being recorded. It\u2019s now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Lee McEntire. Please go ahead. Lee McEntire : Good morning. Thanks to everyone on the phone, as well as webcast for joining us this morning for the first quarter results. Hopefully, everybody had a chance to review the earnings release documents that are available on the website. Before I turn the call over to Brian and Bruce, let me just remind you, we may make forward-looking statements. For further information on those, please refer to either our earnings release documents, our website or other SEC filings. So, with that, let me turn it over to Brian Moynihan, our CEO for some opening comments, before Bruce goes through the details. Brian? Brian Moynihan : Thank you, Lee. And good morning and welcome everyone to the earnings call for our first quarter of 2015. I am going to start on slide two. So the highlights are there. We earned $3.4 billion after tax in the quarter, which is up both on a linked quarter and year-over-year basis. We continue to work to drive growth in all our core businesses. We will begin to see it overcome the runoff at non-core portfolios in many areas. At the same time, we continue to focus on managing expenses carefully. As a result, we\u2019ve begin to see more predictable earnings with more improvement expected ahead. Both capital and liquidity remained at record levels in our company. We expect to return more capital to shareholders this year than we have in the past. Revenue on adjusted bases was $21.9 billion for the quarter. From the top of the house revenues remains challenging in an environment with below trend economic growth and rate environment which comes from that. In addition, we remained faithful to our customer\u2019s strategy with strong risk management and risk appetite to ensure we do not repeat the outsized credit losses of the past. With that said, we are seeing our core business stabilizing across the drivers of the revenue. This quarter we saw continued growth in our Wealth Management revenues and rebounds in the fourth quarter in trading revenues. In our loan and deposit areas we saw continued core growth albeit subject to continued spread contraction. Our expense management efforts continue. Year-over-year expenses excluding litigation costs are down 6%, including litigation costs, year-over-year expenses are down 30%. We continue to see our efficiency efforts drive forward beyond new BAC through our simplified and improved program. We also continue to see progress on LAS expense. As proof of our efforts for the quarter we ended with our headcount at 200 -- little under 220,000 full time employees, a reduction of 4,000 employees for the quarter about 2% and 19,000 employees year-over-year or 8%. For the quarter this reduction came to about 35% from LAS and about 65% from the rest of the company. To put it in a broad context, we are approaching employment levels, where we were in early 2008, prior to bringing over -- in over 100,000 people from Countrywide and Merrill acquisitions. We are doing that through the investments we are making in technology to reduce costs and they continue to take hold, and we will continue to drive this effort even as economy continues to improve and rates raise helping keep balance to our operating leverage. During the last year, even though we are reducing those costs and headcount, we continue to invest in the client facing growth capacity in this company. We have added financial advisors in U.S. Trusts and in Merrill Lynch focused on building for the future. We have added commercial bankers in all our Global Banking areas to help fill in our franchise. We have added new financial centers in areas of opportunity and we continue to invest in products and innovation, as well as efficiency. A simple example, in our Consumer Mobile Banking space, we now have 70 million mobile banking customers up over 2 million from last year. Turning to slide three, you can see what we simply need to do. Each of the four core lines of businesses on the left hand part of the slide earned above our cost-of-capital for this quarter. In addition, the aggregate earnings for all those businesses were $4.4 billion after tax. The LAS segment had a much smaller loss this quarter, showing we are making progress. The other area on the right hand of the slide effected this quarter by the impacts of retirement eligible incentive costs in the market related NII adjustment which affect the top of the house earnings. They booked their distributed business over the quarters, what that shows that we need to keep working LAS to get it to breakeven and the other will take care of itself in subsequent quarters. Turning to slide four, with regard to CCAR. As previously disclosed, we received a conditional non-objection to our capital plan. We received the approval for our request to capital actions that we request in our original submission, a dividend of $0.05 per share and $4 billion of stock repurchase on the relevant periods. As you can see, the cushion we have increased from about $2 billion last year under the tightest constraint to over $22 billion this year, in both those cases under the tightest constraint after all capital actions. These quantitative results bode well. However, the conditional approval is an area with which we are focusing. We will focus our energy for the September resubmission and beyond. Our efforts are well underway. We are bringing additional resources to task. We simply have to be the best at CCAR to meet our shareholder objectives and our company. To ensure that we achieve that success I\u2019d have asked Terry Laughlin to lead our efforts. As many of you know, Terry helped us clear up the mortgage issues over the last several years. I can assure you that our Board management are extremely focused on our resubmission and our core process improvement for CCAR 2016 next year. Terry has retained the team external experts, increase internal staffing to ensure we are successful. We\u2019ve had in-depth discussion with our regulators regarding the particulars specified issues that we need to re-immediate with the resubmission and we are focused on getting that done by September. With that, I\u2019ll turn now over to Bruce. Bruce Thompson : Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. I am going to start on slide five. As Brian mentioned, we recorded $3.4 billion of earnings in the first quarter or $0.27 per diluted share. That compares to $0.25 a share in the fourth quarter of 2014 and a loss of $0.05 if we go back to the first quarter of 2014. I\u2019d like to note a few items as you review these results. Both first quarter periods include $1 billion in expense for the annual cost of retirement eligible incentives awarded. This was $0.06 in EPS impact in each of the first quarter periods. The first quarter of 2015 also includes a negative market related adjustments to net interest income of $484 million for the acceleration of bond premium amortization on our debt securities that\u2019s driven by lower long-term rates. That costs us $0.03 in EPS during the quarter. The other large item that\u2019s worth noting as you look at the comparisons is the outsized litigation amount of $6 billion in the first quarter of 2014. I\u2019d like to spend just a moment on total revenue comparisons, our first quarter of 2015 revenue on an FTE basis. If we exclude the market-related adjustment to NII and a small DVA adjustment was $21.9 billion during the quarter. If we compared that to the fourth quarter of 2014 and adjust for the same items, revenue is up $1.7 billion or 8% and that 8% increase is attributable to rebound in sales and trading results, as well as higher Mortgage Banking income and is offset somewhat by lower net interest income mostly from two fewer days during the quarter. If we compare back to the first quarter of \u201914 and we further adjust for $800 million in equity investment gains as a result of monetizing a single strategic investment in a year ago period, revenue is down a couple $100 million or 1% and that\u2019s from lower net interest income and lower sales and trading results. Total non-interest expense during the quarter was $15.7 billion and included the $1 billion in retirement eligible costs, as well as $370 million in litigation expense. I will go through that the comparisons from an expense perspective several slides back. As we look at provision for credit losses during the quarter, they were $765 million and included $429 million in reserve release versus $660 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. Preferred dividends during the first quarter were $382 million and as you all looked to update your models given the preferred issuances that we have had the majority of which paid semiannually as you look at preferred dividends they should be roughly $330 million in the second and fourth quarters, and $440 million in the first and third quarters going forward based on our existing preferred footprint. Let\u2019s go ahead and move to slide six on the balance sheet, our balance sheet was up slightly to $2.14 trillion and that was driven almost exclusively by cash balances associated with the deposit growth that we saw during the quarter. We continued our focus on balance sheet optimization for the liquidity, as we continue to shift some of our discretionary portfolio first lien loans into HQLA eligible securities. Loans on a period end basis were down modestly, reflecting good core loan activity in both our Global Banking, as well as our Wealth Management segments that was more than offset by seasonally lower cad balances in our discretionary consumer real estate area, as well as runoff portfolios. Deposits were up $34 billion or 3% from the end of the year and some of that, obviously, I have to do with seasonal tax activity. We issued $3 billion of preferred stock in the quarter that benefited regulatory capital and as you look at common shareholders\u2019 equity you can see it improved driven both by earnings growth, as well as improved OCI. As a result of those factors, tangible book value increased to $14.79, 7% higher than 12 months ago and our tangible common equity ratio improved to 7.5%. The last point that I would note is that we did add a slide in the appendix as we updated our capital allocations across the segments coming into 2015 and the returns that we show you are reflective of those updated capital allocations. Let\u2019s go ahead and flip to slide seven, and go through loans, from several calls, we are asked frequently about the decline in reported loans, which are down modestly again from the fourth quarter levels as you can see in the upper left hand chart. I want to make a few points though as we go through this, as we have discussed many times, much of the movement in loans has been driven by two pieces of non-core loans. The first relates the shift in our discretionary mortgage loans levels that are used to manage interest rate risks and predominantly recorded in the all other units. Many times based on the investment decisions that we make, these loans are replaced with debt securities on the balance sheet. The other component, as you look at loans to consider is the runoff that we have within our LAS unit, which are mostly home equity loans. If the home equity loans go away, it enables us to reduce our operating costs as we have less work to do. As you can see over the past five quarters, these non-core loans have declined approximately $59 billion. If you adjust for that $59 billion though and I will go that upper right hand box, you can see they are actually -- our loans have actually increased by $21 billion from the first quarter of 2014. Bottom chart on this slide provides the mix of this loan growth across our primary businesses and you can see within our Wealth Management area, we have experienced strong demand in both consumer real estate, as well as securities base lending and that\u2019s led to year-over-year loan growth within that segment of 10%. Within Global Banking, we saw modest growth on a year-over-year basis. But importantly, we saw a significant pickup in activity in the first quarter of \u201915 relative to the fourth quarter of 2014. Over that timeframe loans were up $6.7 billion or 8% on an annualized basis. If we move to slide eight and take a look at regulatory capital, this quarter the Standardized transition reporting includes the switch from reporting RWA under the general risks based approach to Basel 3 and the capital number includes another year of phase-in for capital deductions. With those changes, our CET1 ratio was 11.1% in 2015 under the new reporting. If we go ahead and look at Basel 3 regulatory capital on our fully phase-in basis, our CET1 capital improved $6 billion during the quarter and was driven by earnings, lower DTA, lower threshold deductions, as well as an improvement in AOCI. That translated under the Standardized approach to our CET1 ratio improving from 10% in the fourth quarter to 10.3% in the first quarter of \u201915, while under the advanced approaches, the CET1 ratio improved from 9.6% to 10.1%. As you know from our 10-K disclosure, we are working with our banking regulators to obtain approval of our models in order to exit parallel run, a regulators have requested modification to certain commercial and other credit models in order to exit parallel run, which we estimate will increase our advanced approaches RWA and negatively impact the CET1 ratio that we show here by approximately 100 basis points. If we look at supplementary leverage, we estimate that at the end of the first quarter of \u201915, we continue to exceed the U.S. rules applicable in 2018. Our bank holding company SLR ratio was 6.3% and our primary banking subsidiary BANA we were at 7%. We turn to slide 9, long-term debt. At the end of the first quarter was $238 billion, down $5 billion from the fourth quarter of 2014. In the lower left box, you can see that from a maturity profile perspective, we have $16 billion of parent company debt that matures during the balance of \u201815 and will be opportunistic as it relates to refinancing that indebtedness. Our global excess liquidity sources reached a record level of $478 billion this quarter and now represents 22% of the overall balance sheet. The increase from the fourth quarter reflects the deposit inflows as well as the shift from discretionary loans in the HQLA securities. Within the liquidity, our parent company liquidity remains quite strong at $93 billion and our time to require funding is at 37 months. During the quarter, we did continue to increase our liquidity coverage ratios at both the parent as well as at the bank levels. And at the end of the first quarter, we estimate that our consolidated company was well above the 100% fully phased-in 2017 LCR requirement. On slide 10, net interest income, on a reported FTE basis was $9.7 billion, down $200 million from the fourth quarter of \u201814 driven by two fewer interest accrual days during the quarter as well as some spread compression. If we exclude the previously mentioned market-related adjustment NII of $10.2 billion was largely in line with our expectations and lower than the fourth quarter of \u201814 given two fewer interest accrual days. Modest improvements net interest income mostly from lower funding cost in the quarter were offset by some of the continued pressures that we saw in loans, securities, yields as well as balances in new assets coming in at lower long-term rates. This drove the adjusted net interest yield to 2.28%. If we look at the movement down in rates during the quarter, our balance sheet did become more asset sensitive compared to year end, such that 100 basis point parallel increase in rates from the end of the quarter would be expected to contribute roughly $4.6 billion in net interest income benefits over the next 12 months, slightly more than half of that $4.6 billion is on the long end and just under half is based on the short end. On slide 11, if we move to expenses, non-interest expense was $15.7 billion in the first quarter of \u201815 and included roughly $370 million in litigation expense. First quarter \u201815 once again did include $1 billion in annual retirement eligible incentive cost consistent with what we saw in the first quarter of 2014. Litigation expense during the quarter included FX in RMBS items and was significantly below what we saw a year ago which included the cost of the FHFA settlement. While we\u2019re in litigation, I do want to make sure that you notice this quarter that we did get one step closer on our Article 77 settlement as the appellate court approved the Bank of New York Mellon settlement in all respects. And I would also note that the deadline for further appeal at this point has passed. If we exclude litigation and retirement-eligible cost, our total expenses were $14.3 billion this quarter, down nearly $1 billion from the first quarter of \u201814, driven by three factors. Continued progress on our LAS initiatives, our New BAC cost savings as well as lower revenue-related incentives within Global Markets. Relative to the fourth quarter \u201814, the expense level on an adjusted basis is up about a $0.5 billion on higher revenue related incentives, mostly through the improved sales and trading results on a linked-quarter basis. Our legacy assets and servicing cost ex litigation were $1 billion. They improved approximately $100 million from the fourth quarter of 2014 in more than $500 million if we go back to the first quarter of 2014. And we remain on track to hit our Q \u201814 target that we laid out for yield of $800 million in LAS cost ex litigation once again in the fourth quarter. Beyond the LAS business, our teams continue to do very good work in optimizing our delivery network as well as our infrastructure. And as you can see, headcount is down 8% over the course of the last 12 months. If we look at asset quality on slide 12, reported net charge-offs were $1.2 billion in the first quarter versus $900 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. I do want to note that the first quarter of \u201815 included a net impact of approximately $200 million in losses associated with the DOJ settlement that was previously reserved for and that was offset in part by recoveries from certain NPL sales.  Our Q4 \u201814 included similar items but with the net adjustment positively benefiting net charge-off to the tune of about $163 million. If we just follow these impacts, our net charge-offs during the quarter were $1 billion which is slightly lower than what we saw in the fourth quarter of 2014. Our loss rates on the same adjusted basis were at about 47 basis points in the first quarter of \u201815 consistent with what we saw in the fourth quarter of \u201814, in both our consumer delinquencies as well as our NPLs decline from fourth quarter levels. On the commercial front, we did see a slight tick up in reservable criticized exposure in the fourth quarter of \u201814 as we bounce off comparatively low levels. The first quarter of \u201815 provision expense was $765 million. We released $429 million in reserves, most of those reserve releases were in our consumer real estate portfolio while we did see a modest increase in reserves in the commercial space that was associated with the strong loan growth that we saw during the first quarter. We could flip to slide 13 on Consumer Banking. Hopefully last week, we all saw and had a chance to review the filing of our recasted segment results. We mentioned to you during the last earnings call that we made changes in segment reporting where we move the home loans into our Consumer Banking segment from CRES which left our legacy assets and servicing as a standalone segment. We also moved the majority of business banking from Consumer Banking to the Global Banking segment which is how we manage the business. All these changes have been made retroactively. Let\u2019s go ahead and walk through the business segment results, starting on slide 13 with Consumer Banking. The results showed solid bottomline performance with earnings of $1.5 billion which is up slightly from the year-ago quarter and down seasonally from the fourth quarter of \u201814 which tends to be a better consumer spending quarter. Business generated a solid 21% return on allocated capital. Total revenue was lower compared to the first quarter of \u201814 from a decline in net interest income. Two thirds of that decline in NII was a result of pushing out in the allocation of the portion of the market related NII adjustment to deposits business. Our non-interest income was stable compared to last year, reflecting good growth in both mortgage banking as well as higher card income but was offset by the portfolio divestiture gain last year of roughly $100 million in the first quarter. Expenses were managed tightly. Non-interest expense declined from the fourth quarter of \u201814 as we continue to reduce our financial centers in the associated cost driven by consumer behavior patterns shifting to more digital. The number of mobile banking customers continues to increase. We ended the quarter at roughly $17 million and -- the activity from these customers accounts for roughly 13% of all deposit transactions. On page 14, we\u2019ve added some additional slides here to give you a sense to some of the trends that we\u2019re seeing in the business in key drivers and see we remain a leader in many aspects of our consumer bank doing business with nearly half of all U.S. households. We look at fees compared to the first quarter of \u201814, part income was up modestly despite some affinity portfolio divestitures over the last year. Our card issuance remains very strong. Our balances did decline as our customers began to pay down holiday spend balance levels and our net charge-offs remain low at 2.8% and risk-adjusted margins remain high. We move to mortgage banking income. It was up 60% as originations for the company ramped up during the quarter. Year-over-year first mortgage originations were up 55% to $13.7 billion while our home equity line and loan originations increased 62% to $3.2 billion. Revenue improvement was driven by these increased volumes as well as the mix of first-lien origination that was 76% weighted towards overall refinance activity. And looking forward, the pipeline remains strong, up 50% from the end of the year. Moving to service charges, service charges were down versus the fourth quarter of \u201814. This fee line continues to be muted as more of our customers take advantage of our work plans in our opening accounts with higher balances. We also continue to reduce the number of less profitable account serviced and migrate customer activity to more self service channels. As a result, we are getting the same or slightly better account fees and debit interchange from fewer accounts which is allowing us to reduce our infrastructure. Expense is declining. And if you look at cost of deposits, it\u2019s dropped from just less than 2% in the fourth -- excuse me -- in the first quarter of \u201814 to 1.87% in the first quarter of \u201815. And lastly, as you can see while we are bringing down our overall headcount in this business, I want to note that we\u2019ve been increasing our sales specialist in the financial centers and their sales are driving client balance is higher. For example, our deposits were up 5% from the first quarter of \u201814 and our brokerage assets were up 18%. We move to slide 15, wealth management. It generated earnings of $651 million during the quarter. We compared this with the fourth -- with the first quarter of 2014 with a $78 million decline. It\u2019s the solid fee growth that we saw during the quarter, was offset by lower net interest income and higher expense. Once again the allocation of the market related NII adjustment drove the decline in NII which more than offset the benefits that we saw from solid loan growth. Our asset management fees continue to grow driven by strong client flows and higher market levels. Our non-interest expense increased from the first quarter of \u201814 as a result of higher revenue related incentives as well as investments in client-facing professionals. Our pre-tax margin was down 23%, down last year, largely impacted by the decline in net interest income. Return on allocated capital remains strong at 22%. We look at the activity in drivers within Wealth Management on slide 16. You can see our asset management fees continue to grow and are up 10% from the first quarter of 2014. But this is partially offset by some of the sluggishness that we\u2019ve seen in transactional revenue within the brokerage line. We do continue to be an employer of choice in this business, increasing financial advisors by more than 850 individuals over the course of the last 12 months. Our client balances climbed to over $2.5 trillion, up $12 billion from the fourth quarter of \u201814, driven by strong client balance inflows. Long-term AUM flows of $15 billion for the quarter were positive for the 23rd consecutive quarter. And as I mentioned earlier when we discussed loans, we continue to experience strong demand in both our securities base and residential mortgage lending areas of the business reaching a new record level in loans during the quarter. On slide 17, our Global Banking earnings during the quarter were $1.4 billion, which generated a 16% return on allocated capital. Earnings were up 6% from the first quarter of \u201814 as the decline in net interest income was more than offset by lower expense as well as improved provision expense. As we look at NII, the year-over-year decline was driven by three things, the allocation of the market related to NII adjustments which I have touched on in previous segments, the push-out of the firm-wide LCR requirements, a good chunk of which goes to Global Banking as well as some year-over-year compression in loan spreads. Our provision expense was lower than the first quarter of \u201814 by $185 million as we did not build reserves to the same magnitude as we did in the first quarter of last year. Non-interest expense was down 8% from the first quarter of \u201814 driven by three factors, lower technology initiative spend, lower litigation as well as lower incentive costs. Moving to the Global Banking metrics on page 18, we chart the components of revenue, which shows stability across the quarters, with the exception of NII as I just mentioned. Our investment banking fees companywide during the quarter were $1.5 billion, down 4% from the first quarter of 2014. I would highlight during the quarter, we recorded the highest level of advisory fees since the Merrill merger, up 50% from the first quarter of 2014. This helped offset the drop that we saw within our leveraged finance business, as a result of the regulatory guidance that was implemented during the first half of 2014. Equity underwriting was also up nicely, up 10% from the first quarter of 2014. And as you look at the balance sheet, loans on average were $290 billion, up modestly on a year-over-year basis. But if you look linked quarter as I mentioned earlier, we had a fair bit of momentum ending the first quarter with balances up $7 billion on a spot basis from the fourth quarter of \u201914. $7 million improvement was broad-based. We saw middle-market utilization rates at levels that we\u2019ve not seen for six years at this point, so we feel good about that and within commercial real estate, we saw a linked quarter improvement as well. On slide 19, Global Markets, we earned $945 million on revenues and $4.6 billion in the quarter, leveraging 11% return on allocated capital during the quarter. Our earnings were up nicely from the fourth quarter of \u201914 but down from the first quarter, as our revenue was down 7%, excluding net DVA and FVA. The decline from the first quarter of \u201914 was driven by lower fixed sales -- excuse me, lower fixed sales and trading results. On the expense front, non-interest expense was modestly higher year-over-year, as we had $260 million in litigation expense in the quarter. Ex-litigation, expenses were down 7% on reduced levels of revenue related incentives.  We look at the Global Markets metrics on slide 20. Sales of trading revenue of $3.9 billion ex-DVA and FVA, as I mentioned was up nicely from our fourth quarter of \u201914 levels but down 5% from the first quarter of \u201914. Fixed sales and trading was down 7% on a year-over-year basis while equities was effectively flat with the year ago period. Within the macro-related product areas like FX and rates, there was a solid return in volatility in client trading activity in the quarter while the credit spreads traded products areas experienced lower activity in line with lower issuance levels during the quarter. And as you look at and we layout a mix between macro and credit in the upper box, upper right hand box and you can see that our activity tends to be more heavily weighted towards credit spread trading given the position that we occupy within the issuer market. And the last point I would make our markets, our asset levels were fairly flat while VaR was below the level that we experienced last year. Slide 21, Legacy Assets & Servicing, you can see we saw improvement in revenue and expense trends compared to both periods within legacy assets and servicing. The loss in this segment narrowed to less than $240 million. Revenue improved as both rep and warrant was down $156 million from the year ago period and we had a more favorable MSR hedge performance. Those two factors were partially offset by lower servicing fees as we continue to reduce the servicing portfolio. Non-interest expense, ex-litigation was a $1 billion in the quarter, once again improving approximately $100 million from the fourth quarter and more than $500 million since the first quarter of \u201914. Importantly, our 60 plus days delinquent loans were 153,000 units that were down 36,000 units or 19% from the fourth quarter of 2014. We move to slide 22, All Other. All Other reflects a loss of $841 million and that includes once again the impact of the annual retirement eligible incentive costs, as well as some of the market-related NII impact. If we compare this quarter to the first quarter of \u201914, revenues lowered by about $683 million and that was driven by nearly $700 million in equity investment gains in the first quarter of \u201914, compared to essentially nothing in the first quarter of \u201915. And it was partially offset, as well by the absence of payment protection loss this quarter, compared to about a $141 million in the prior year quarter. From a modeling perspective, the effective tax rate during the quarter was about 29% and as we look out during the balance of 2015, we would expect the tax rate to be roughly 30%, absent any unusual items. So, I would just wrap up the prepared part of my comments that as we end the quarter, we end the quarter with record capital. We end the quarter with record liquidity. We\u2019ll begin our $4 billion share repurchase program this quarter. The team\u2019s very focused on addressing our CCAR submission. Expense management remains a key focus across the company. Our businesses are showing good activity, including a pick up in lending across several businesses and the company credit quality remains strong and we remain well positioned to benefit in a rising interest rate environment. And with that, we\u2019ll go ahead and open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we can take our first question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Betsy Graseck : Hey. Thanks very much. So, Brian, very impressive commentary in the beginning of the call on headcount getting back to \u201908 levels before CFC and the Merrill Lynch acquisitions. The one question we get continually from investors is what\u2019s left to do on the expenses and you\u2019ve already got the core expense number coming into the $13 billion range. So can you give us some sense as to where you go from here on expense management and is it steady as she goes or is there room to become even more efficient? Brian Moynihan : Couple of things. One is that if you parse expenses, Betsy, into three basic buckets, the litigation expense bucket, which you are seeing come down to more reasonable levels and then there is a cost of that litigation and the external legal fees and stuff, which will continue to see lift in which is in the expense numbers. Then you have the second bucket LAS worth a billion level and as Bruce said, we would expect to get down to $800 million and keep moving at to lower numbers over into \u201916. And then given the baseline and I think the thought on the baseline is even as we reduce the headcount, we continued to reinvest in sales capacity. So just in our consumer business, headcount is down year-over-year but we have a thousand more sales people roughly out there selling. And so the idea is to continue to drive sales people into the businesses. At the same time, we\u2019ve taken our wealth management, et cetera. So when you think about the broad expense base, there is adjustments always in the first quarter, second quarter just because of revenue and stuff in terms of the aggregate amount. But we will continue to pare way. You can look linked quarter -- year-over-year quarters over the last four years, we continued to chip away. This year it was 300 on the core base. We will continue to work at that. But I would say that a lot of it, we are trying to make sure that we create the investment rate and continue to grow the franchises and their size. This is a matter of holding these expenses relatively flat as revenues start to pick up with the expected increase in rates in economy continue to grow. As that change, we have to go aggressively and push down the core also. And so we manage it everyday and you can see the headcounts leading indicator because that headcount reduction in the quarter really benefits us in the second quarter. Betsy Graseck : Got it. And then just separate topic on GWIM, and maybe you could give us some commentary around how you are thinking about the impact of the fiduciary language that\u2019s been coming out of the Department of Labor? And also how you deal with the competitive threats coming from Silicon Valley, including some of the robo-advisor efforts? Brian Moynihan : On the first question, John Thiel who runs Merrill Lynch for us, where largely we are affected by the discussion on fiduciary standards. Remember, U.S. Trust is actually a private bank and operates into the fiduciary standard and most of its activity. So, John Thiel does the lead in our business does great job for us and has been clear. We believe that doing what\u2019s in the best interest of the customer is absolutely the right thing to do. And while this rule has just come out yesterday afternoon and frankly, Betsy, to get prepared for your questions this morning, I have spent a lot of time examining into detail. But from a basic standpoint, we\u2019ve been clear that that\u2019s we see the industry moving and we expect lot of movement there. On the robo-advisor, I think that the clear segment match for us in that area in terms of what Schwab and other people have talked about is really in the Merrill Lynch business, which is below the Merrill Lynch cut-off a lot of their return. So, John and his team drive people to $150,000 in investable assets free to invest, which is net worth of a $0.5 million in the upper range of the client and Dean Athanasia and his preferred team drive the business below that. And if you look in our information, you will see that that business has got about $118 billion of both, which assets are growing faster than the industry. Year-over-year, I think the assets were up 18%. The number of accounts of the sales levels were up and so that\u2019s really the automated rebalancing portfolios and stuff like that and we are driving that through as a core execution. And by the way, they also refer tens of thousands of customers a year up to Merrill Lynch at the same time. So we are trying to have the best of both worlds. Betsy Graseck : Okay. Thanks. You\u2019ve been a leader there, so appreciate that color. Thanks. Operator : And we can take our next question from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Matt O'Connor: Good morning. Brian Moynihan : Good morning, Matt. Matt O'Connor: Any sense of when we get a clear picture on the final impact of exiting parallel run? Should we just assume the 100 basis point hit that you mentioned a done deal or is there a potential to be less than that? Bruce Thompson : Yes. I think what we wanted to disclose, Matt is that I think they were coming out of the disclosure that we had in the K. There were a lot of questions and you are absolutely right that what we disclosed today was the requested amount from our banking regulators to exit parallel run that was the outcome. We have discussions continue but we did want to put out there what the ask was. Matt O'Connor: Okay. In terms of timing of -- a conclusion on that? Bruce Thompson : I think those things are always hard to predict, but we are obviously working hard to get through it over the next quarter or so. Matt O'Connor: Okay. And just related, I mean, obviously capital build was very good this quarter of 50 basis points. So you essentially got half of that already, but assuming that 100 basis point hit goes through, are there additional kind of RWA levers to pull model adjustments in the future that we can think about? Bruce Thompson : Yeah. You asked a very good question, which is that -- to the extend that there is an adjustment in the RWA, you obviously as you look to refine and improve your models, always have the ability to work hard to get that back if there is obviously a lot of scrutiny with respect to models. But your point is spot on is that there would be the opportunity as we work through and look to refine improve and become better with our models to get some of that back over time. Brian Moynihan : And Matt, in the broader context, we have flipped the binding constraint in our company to some degree with the move to advance and so therefore, you continue to look at the balance sheet, what makes the businesses and how you approach the businesses changes again to standardize with the constraint we are focused on. And with our binding constraint now it\u2019s going to flip to advance as you can see in the numbers and that bend is -- you expect us to be as aggressive and in depth at thinking through how we mix the businesses right to make sure that we are focused on that constraint now has become a binding rule. Matt O'Connor: Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. Operator : And we can take our next question from Paul Miller with FBR Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Paul Miller : Yes. Thank you very much. On your legacy asset servicing -- in your discussions, you said that the loans went down from 36,000 loans in the quarter. Did you sell any loans in the quarter? Bruce Thompson : There was some servicing of loans that was moved, as well as the outright sale of some non-performing loans. So there was some inorganic activity but as you look at those reductions, it was very strong from both organic as well as inorganic. And I would say the other thing that we are seeing Paul is just less new delinquencies coming in than we what we would have expected. So you\u2019ve got the benefit of less coming in. You\u2019ve got the benefit of working through some of what you have and then we are supplementing that with moving additional out. Paul Miller : Yeah. And one of the things out there is what we are seeing or hearing is that there is a strong market right now for people wanting to buy either re-performing or non-performing loans. Are you going to use that as an advantage to start moving the stuff off your books quicker? Bruce Thompson : We have been using as an advantage. If you go back and look at the results, I think we were one of the first out there that started to move those loans in the first half of 2014. We\u2019ve been aggressively doing that both to take the risk of the loans off as well as to move the servicing. And I think as if you look at the impact of that and how it flows through different things, you really get a good sense, Paul, when you look at some of the CCAR results where the loss content that we have particularly within both first mortgages as well as home equity has come down. So we have been at that for some time at this point. Brian Moynihan : Paul, I think overall remember as you get further and further remove from the crisis, what\u2019s leftover or even though at the time when we said fairly answer that some of these non-core portfolios would have been a product to service, you did want to continue seven years later, you are seeing the customers are left over to paid. And so there is a good bid, but also we want to make sure we measure the economics of the portfolios. Now they are much smaller. The risk is way down. And so we judge that really on the basis of, who the customer is and whether we want to sort of roam into core loans in our company and then also what the economics the outside are. So I wouldn\u2019t expect us to change our course there, whether its look opportunistically, we had to keep move in the right direction on both servicing and that\u2019s that we own too because remember Paul there is also servicing side to this, even though we don\u2019t own the asset. There is a strong bid. Even the agencies are moving to move some portfolios. Paul Miller : Okay. Thank you, guys. Brian Moynihan : Thank you. Operator : And we can take our next question from Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead. Jim Mitchell : Hey, good morning. Brian Moynihan : Good morning. Jim Mitchell : Just want to follow up on the capital discussion. You guys had pretty good progress on the advanced approach of 50 basis points quarter-over-quarter, but the gap between standardized and advanced is still very large. And I guess if you have to go through with the 400 basis points that I guess about 120 basis point gap versus your peers that are less than half that. I guess is the big difference operational risk because of the larger litigation you faced over the last couple of years? And how do we think about that coming down and getting more in line with the peers? Is that just a time sort of as you get further away that, like those op risk come down or how else do we think about the trajectory of the closing of the gap? Brian Moynihan : No. Your point is exactly right which is that as we talked about last quarter that the op risk relative to the total advanced startup was upwards of 30%. That\u2019s obviously higher than our peers. It\u2019s something that we are working hard on to be able to drive down. And to your point, the question is when you\u2019re able to get benefit from declining litigation trend as we wrap up the legacy matters and that does take some time. Obviously, the last two quarters from litigation perspective have been much lighter than what we experienced going back several years. So it\u2019s up to us to continue to work that and to look to convince people that the level of op risk capital should come down given the resolution of the matters. And I would just highlight that once again whether you look at Article 77, there was an Ocala litigation matter that was wrapped up as well as on the RMBS front with settlements that we got through this quarter were roughly 99% of all threatened or filed litigation with respect to RMBS. So we continue to work through that and drive through that. And ultimately the benefit from that should be lower op risk capital from an RWA perspective. Jim Mitchell : Right. And sorry, is that sort of a negotiation process on the models with regulators or is it could it be sort of a step function or is it really just time value as you move further away? I am just trying to understand the process. Brian Moynihan : I think in all these cases, clearly that we work closely with our supervisors on all model related activity. And as you look to make changes that are to the good, you obviously need to work through your regulators to get those put through. Bruce Thompson : So I think as we think forward remember, you saw a good capital built this quarter and we will continue to build. But remember that we keep on the course of earnings that we expect and the issue was in CCAR last year when we asked, you had to remember we came off a really low just nominal earnings environment. And so we came with a lot of capital between now and next time. We\u2019ve been asked to change the capital position of the company and we have a big cushion. So we will close this gap relatively quickly. And then we have a longer-term question of what you are saying which is as op risk runs off how do you get that reflected all coming your capital requirements and same with the models and the other side. Jim Mitchell : Right at to your point, the stress test is based on standardized not advanced? Bruce Thompson : Yes. Jim Mitchell : But just one quick follow-up elsewhere on the FICC revenues, just can you talk about the trajectory over the quarter, did it improve in March? It sounded like some of your peers talked about a slow start to get any better in March or how do we think about the trajectory to the quarter? Brian Moynihan : I am always hesitant to comment on results given that we are nine days into a new quarter. But I think if you look at what we saw from both, I would say both a sales and trading as well as an overall investment banking fee perspective, the January and the margin was a little bit slower than what was expected. And we saw activity and momentum build up throughout the quarter to where if you had to grade which is three months to the quarter. If you feel best about, it was clearly March. And like I said, we are only nine trading days into the new quarter. But we\u2019ve not seen anything change directionally some of the activity that we saw in March, we\u2019ve continued to see in April. Jim Mitchell : Okay. Great. That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks. Operator : And we can take our next question from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Glenn Schorr : Thanks very much. A quick question on proposal eight in the proxy, I mean I don\u2019t think the regulators wanted to happen, I don\u2019t think it should happen, I assume you have been doing a lot of the work on this along the way for last couple of years. But curious why the Board is so against shareholders voting it for and what you actually have to do if it does get the yes vote? Brian Moynihan : Well, I think as I think you read the response in the proxy, Glenn, you will see this is a core Board duty and they do look at it periodically and think about the optimal company structure, capital structure. So the idea to have a special element around it is really the whole Board looks at it and that\u2019s you should look at it so. And then the technical terms of the what the request is or little hard to understand when you think about how company really operates, but we do look at the question of, do we have the optimal business mix, is it optimal from shareholders and the Board will look at it continuously and we will continue to look at. Glenn Schorr : Okay. I appreciate the comments you made on the increased asset sensitivity. And if I remember the numbers correctly, it sounds like more of the increased sensitivity came out on the long end. So I guess my question is, it\u2019s great you make a lot more money at the current shifts of 100 basis points, but I think a lot of people are more fearful of what happens if we get into a flattener environment. So is it as simply as you capture at least half the benefit short rates going up and if you are in the flattener that\u2019s where then? Bruce Thompson : I think couple of things Glenn. First is that we are coming -- in many respects we were 35, 36 at the end of the year, we went to 45, 46 this quarter. Keep in mind a chunk of what you see as far as becoming more asset sensitive is just the FAS 91 that we lost during the quarter. So keep that in mind. And to your point, you are exactly right if you looked out where we were at year end, I think we were just over in the 21 to 22 benefit from short rates moving and that has not changed materially. So to your point the asset sensitivity is based almost solely on long-term rates and given the deltas that we saw change from the end of the year to the end of the first quarter. Glenn Schorr : Okay. I appreciate it. Thank you. Brian Moynihan : Thank you. Operator : We will take our next question from Jon McDonald with Sanford C. Bernstein. Please go ahead. Jon McDonald : Hi, Bruce. Just to follow up on that in terms of if rates kind of stay pretty flat, what kind of outlook would you have for the core NII if we take the 10.2 this quarter as a jumping off point? Do you have any room to lower the debt cost from here or how would you expect the core NII to trend if we don\u2019t see too much move in rates? Bruce Thompson : We spent a lot of time on, Jon. We got at the end of the first quarter, we looked at and said during the balance of 2015, what\u2019s the impact that we would see if in effect we rolled the spot throughout 2015, which just means that you don\u2019t get the benefit of the curve as we go through. And if you look at that, it\u2019s roughly a couple hundred million dollars a quarter relative to $10 billion of NII. So we think that we\u2019ve done between the debt footprint deposits. And if you actually look at the clean yields during the quarter Q4 to Q1 that we have done a pretty good job of managing this exposure in what\u2019s been a tough environment. But to your question there is probably a couple hundred million dollars a quarter and risk if you roll the spot. Jon McDonald : Got it. Okay. And that couple hundred million over a couple of quarters, right? Bruce Thompson : It is up 200 per quarter over the next three quarters. Jon McDonald : Got it. And that\u2019s just kind of core leakage from new stuff coming on lower yields and you are not investing much in a low rate environment? Bruce Thompson : That\u2019s correct. Brian Moynihan : And continue to shorten the balance sheet every time. Jon McDonald : Okay. And then just switching gears for this on the credit side, do you see the net charges-off kind of bouncing around a $1 billion per quarter level or is there room for those to come down or is that kind of stabilizing and how should we think about reserve releases from here relative to the 400 or so you did this quarter? Brian Moynihan : Yes. Couple of things. And we continue to see Jon if you look at the -- within the consumer space and overall consumer credit, the first quarter typically all other things being equal is the toughest consumer quarter in the first quarter. So I think there is probably a little bit of room there if we continue to see what we see in the economy on the consumer side. The tougher piece of it\u2019s probably to judge commercial because outside of what we see in the small business lending, there really haven\u2019t been many charge-offs and we will just have to see how long that benign environment covers. On the reserve release for the quarter, what they want to make sure that we point out that while we release 400 plus of reserves, 200 of that was from the DOJ where with the mailings you had both charge-offs and reserve release. So as it relates to just from a -- as you look at the provision perspective realize that which impacted the provisions more like 200. Jon McDonald : Okay. So that should be some at least the jumping off points more like a 200 reserve release number? Brian Moynihan : Yes. And I think we said that we clearly expect reserve releases to moderate. So, a lot to see as we roll into the quarters. But I think you are directionally right on your charge-off number and we will see if there is anything left in the reserve releases as we go through the second and third quarters. Jon McDonald : Okay. Last quick thing for me. In terms of rep and warrants, the slide 26 not sure if you mentioned this already because there is a pickup in the claims, the new claims this quarter showed a big increase. Just what\u2019s the driver of that while they will show up now and any color you can provide on whether that\u2019s a concern or not? Brian Moynihan : Yes. I think you need to go down to and we laid out in the footnote, but if you start up in the new claim trends, if you recall there is the case going through where the statute of limitations on rep and warrant claims in the Ace case was found, the statute was six years. And if you look at the claims that you see up in the new claim trends, you can see virtually all of those claims were in the pre 2005 through 2006 area. So absent any tolling a good chunk of those are going to be time barred. The other part that I would -- the other point that I would mention is if you go down to the footnote, you can see that the vast majority of these claims were put in with no file worked on whatsoever or no individual loan work that was done. So I think there continues to be obviously activity on that front, but there is not a lot of work being done as those claims are being filed. Jon McDonald : Okay. Thank you. Brian Moynihan : Thank you. Operator : We will take our next question from Steven Chubak with Nomura. Please go ahead. Steven Chubak : Hi, good morning. Brian Moynihan : Good morning. Steven Chubak : So Bruce I just wanted to touch on the preferreds for a moment. So we saw that you completed another $3 billion of issuance in the quarter, but seem as you are already at the 150 basis point target contemplated under Basel III, whether it\u2019s fair to assume that you are now full on perhaps at the moment and we shouldn\u2019t expect any additional issuance? Bruce Thompson : I think you are absolutely right that we\u2019ve got the bucket filled up this quarter. I think the only thing that\u2019s out there is depending on exactly where we come out from an overall RWA perspective as we exit parallel run that beyond 2015 could there be a $2 billion more preferred sometime during \u201816, that\u2019s a possibility. But you\u2019re absolutely right that based on where we are from an RWA perspective, the buckets filled up. So we don\u2019t see much of any at all in \u201815 maybe a little bit in \u201816 but not much. Steven Chubak : Excellent. Thanks for clarifying that, Bruce. And I suppose that you mentioned RWA, one thing I just wanted to clarify, I believe it was relating to your response to Jim where you noted that for CCAR it only contemplate the standardized approach. But I just wanted to know if that determination have been finalized since some are speculating that the advanced approach could be incorporated within the CCAR exam going forward? Bruce Thompson : Yeah. No, there is an open question out there that you\u2019re absolutely right that for the different CCAR submissions that went in 2015 that those submissions are against the standard ratios. As an industry, we just don\u2019t know the answer. If we\u2019ll test under just standardized in CCAR 2016 or if advanced will be brought in, that\u2019s an open question that\u2019s out there for the industry. Steven Chubak : And do you have a sense at least for the moment as to what the impact will be on RWAs if they were to incorporate the advanced approach versus the standardized? Bruce Thompson : I think if you look at the numbers you can see the difference that we have within our numbers as to advanced. I think the open question that\u2019s out there as you look at moving to advanced in a CCAR scenario is that under advanced you hold the capital for up risk. And then there is the open question if you go to stress test under advanced, what do you do with respect to CCAR in those up risk litigation type item. And like I said, that\u2019s an open question for the industry. Steven Chubak : Right. But would it be fair to expect that because it is the advanced calculation is more procyclical in nature that the RWA is calculated under a period of stress would be higher versus the standardized? Bruce Thompson : There is no question. There is a procyclical class that does it. That intuitively, I think you\u2019re right but it just until you understand exactly the completeness and the entire picture of what you\u2019re looking at I just don\u2019t want to speculate. Steven Chubak : No. Fair enough. All right. That\u2019s it for me. And thank you for taking my questions. Bruce Thompson : Thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Ken Usdin : Thanks. Good morning. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the investments in brokerage services business. The metrics continue to look very strong as far as assets gain but the growth rate on year-over-year basis looks like it slowed considerably. Any context you can provide around revenue generation and is there a potential catch-up that we should see or expect going forward based on either markets or just activity levels? Brian Moynihan : Let me -- from a high level, that team has continued to invest in growth. So there\u2019s a couple of things driving that. One is they\u2019re adding more core advisor, so in the last 12 months I think we added 120 experienced advisors and we added almost 900 total. So in that there is a carry cost to bring those up but we\u2019ve -- that's good for the future. The second thing is there\u2019s a little bit of the business mix issue which is that the investment management side of business continues to grow but we\u2019ve seen weakness in the brokers transactional side as the business get reposition and that sort of year-over-year is enough to hit you. And then third frankly is that the NII that Bruce point out earlier, just the way we allocate and we won\u2019t let businesses take an excuse for intercompany allocations. But the way we allocate year-over-year, a big chunk of the NII losses just to the way we allocate out the impact from the market and less NII. Ken Usdin : Okay. And then secondly, just extending that to the other -- some of the other consumer fee lines, your card income flattish in service charges down a bit, is this customer behavior driven or an additional repositioning in there? And can you talk about growth expectations on the consumer side as well? Brian Moynihan : Yes. I think as Bruce talked about earlier, if you think about the couple of broad things. One is as we continue to drive to be the core checking account for households, we\u2019re seeing higher sales, we\u2019re seeing higher primary sales but with that comes less fees in a sense but the average balances are higher. And so what you\u2019re seeing is a lower -- the flattening of the fees, charge on accounts overdraft and other fees, while you see an increase in the consumer balances which in this environment were something that we worth a lot more as rates rise because these are core checking account. So yeah, there is some elements that how the business has been shipped and based on our priority of getting -- making sure that we just don\u2019t have a lot of checking accounts, we have a lot of core checking account and that has caused it. So you\u2019re seeing a far faster growth in balances and actually slight decline in total check accounts out there. When you put debit fees and other fees plus the interest rates together which is a core checking revenue, it\u2019s actually a better picture. But that\u2019s kind of the story there. On the credit card fees, it\u2019s -- basically we have absorbed most of the compression on the interchange at this point in the rebase we give. So really year-over-year you had a bit of loss there because we added a divestiture of a big Affinity program, two big Affinity program that hurt us. And you should expect to see that a little bit more inline with our spending growth going forward which has done about 3%, 4%. Ken Usdin : Okay. And then last one, just Bruce, you mentioned on the discretionary portfolio and the switch out to HQLA. Can you give us a sense of just how much more of that mix shift we should expect or at some point, you get to appoint where the loan portfolio finally starts to bottom out? Bruce Thompson : I think a couple of things, so that the shift to the discretionary portfolio, you probably have about $5 billion of that in each of the second quarter and the third quarter of this year and at that point that work is done. I would say as you look at just discretionary mortgage balances and what you\u2019re seeing from a payments for the old stuff that was put within the investment portfolio, you\u2019re probably looking at before the new is that we put on within the business that you are in $10 billion to $14 billion type run-off in each of the next couple quarters, realized all that net interest income doesn\u2019t go away because there is reinvestment of that and there is new loans coming in. But you do have probably two more quarters where we\u2019ll move stuff into securities and obviously that does continue to be a runoff of that portfolio as well. Ken Usdin : Thank you. Bruce Thompson : Thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead. Eric Wasserstrom : Thanks very much. Just one quick question on the legal expense that was incurred in this period, are those issues now the FX and the RMBS, are those issues now settled or are they ongoing? Bruce Thompson : The RMBS piece I quoted, there were both amounts and litigation for things that were settled, as well as accruals during the quarter. And once again Eric, I will go back to that the -- from an RMBS perspective at this point, we are 98% or 99% of threatened or filed claims on original UPB that we are through. So that\u2019s where we are with the RMBS. With respect to the FX piece, I think if you go back and look at to where we said that we were in October, that we resolved the matter with the OCC. The top-up that we saw in the quarter related to FX with respect to other banking regulators and the results. So the resolution and we\u2019re working through the final documentation of the civil piece of the overall FX work and that\u2019s all included within the litigation reserve during the quarter. Eric Wasserstrom : Okay. And so just to understand that last point, the civil component, is that with the DoJ or some other kind of authority? Bruce Thompson : No. It\u2019s the civil piece with respect to a class action type matter, not the DoJ. Eric Wasserstrom : I see. Okay. But that was contained within the accrual in this period. Bruce Thompson : That\u2019s correct. Eric Wasserstrom : Okay. Great. Thank you for the clarity. Bruce Thompson : Thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead. Mike Mayo : Hi. What are your financial targets for 2015 and 2016? Brian Moynihan : So, Mike, as we said, our goal is to continue to drive toward the 1% return on assets and depending on where we end up with capital between 7.5% and 8% tangible common equity ratio that we translate into 13 to down to 12 return on tangible common equity. In this quarter, we move to up to where we have our return on tangible common equity was 8%. And so return on assets was 64 basis points, so we serve two-thirds of the way to that goal. Mike Mayo : And what timeframe do you expect to get there? Brian Moynihan : Well, I think if you adjust our earnings this quarter for a couple of things, the FAS 123, the FAS 91 and then we continue to think of LAS normalizing. You see us get close to that goal and that should happen between now and the end of \u201816 because we just keep chunking away at LAS as we described here. Mike Mayo : So is that your specific financial targets to -- and what\u2019s your target for 2015 when it comes to your financial metrics? Brian Moynihan : Yeah. Mike, I think the way you ask that, we especially have to give you our earnings estimates for \u201915 and we just don\u2019t do that. But our targets long-term, we\u2019ve told you each time you asked us is a 1% return on assets and a 12%, 13% return on tangible common equity based on what we think our tangible common equity ratio will settle out. Mike Mayo : Okay. I guess when I looked back at 2014 I ask myself the question, did Bank America meet its financial targets? And I\u2019ve trouble because I\u2019m not sure that you have specific targets just for the year 2014 as opposed to your longer term targets? Brian Moynihan : We made $4 billion in change last year against the expectation by unit you and your colleagues of -- I don\u2019t know $15 billion that clearly did meet the financial targets to litigation we took last year. Mike Mayo : Okay. Let me just ask a separate question then. Glenn Schorr brought a proposal in the proxy. And I guess my reaction is why not give more information on the tradeoffs of the business model. One of your competitors gave three slides on this topic at their investor day. They weren\u2019t asked to do this and they have some higher ROE and ROA. So more information I think would be good. And in the proxy, it says that your Board believes that the proposal would not enhance stockholder value. If that\u2019s the conclusion of the Board, just why not share some of the insights of the Board to investors? Brian Moynihan : So the insights we have and you look at the returns on page two and three of the material show that the core businesses return above our cost of capital. And that the mix between them and the revenue synergies and the diversity we get have been there but let\u2019s backup. A lot of people are looking at here, Mike, is can you simplify your company to make it tighter. We started that in 2010 was about $2.5 billion and we are trading that as we are down to 2.1. We started with about $7 billion in capital or $8 billion in capital, up to $140 billion and we started by getting rid of the 60 operating businesses and so we\u2019ve done a lot of implications. What\u2019s really left and this is one of the reason why our market business is more constrained its growth prospects potentially than some other peoples because we keep it to about a third of the franchise in terms of size. And that market business is really focused on driving the value of our issuer side customers going to the market and then with our investor side customers providing sources of capital for that, so it\u2019s a very synergistic basis. So, we\u2019ll continue to provide insight but if you look at it, the businesses return of other cost of capital and then if we put them out there, the question would be, what we be look like after and we have capital we can\u2019t deploy and we have less earnings powers. Mike Mayo : All right. But you can share additional insights into that conclusion in addition to what you just gave, that would be great at least in the future. Thanks a lot. Operator : And we can take our next question from Nancy Bush with NAB Research. Please go ahead. Nancy Bush : Good morning, guys. Brian Moynihan : Good morning. Nancy Bush : I have sort of one straightforward question and one that\u2019s more existential. I\u2019ll ask the straight forward one first. Brian, could you just restate your position on paying or raising the dividend? I know the CCAR this year has distorted that a bit and if you could just state how you feel about dividends versus buyback? Brian Moynihan : Well, I think number one, in terms of -- we received approval for what we asked, which is a nickel a share dividend and $4 billion of stock buyback in the CCAR. And we had to be conservative in that ask, leaving aside the modeling and other questions, but just had to be conservative based ask, because if you think about it, our run rate of earnings was such that we\u2019re coming off of $4 billion plus earnings score. We had to keep our head on in terms of how we\u2019re accumulating capital and make sure we earned the capital before we paid them. The second thing is that the [$0.2 billion] [ph] of cushion shows that based on all the works at CCAR, we have a strong cushion going forward. So the key for us to be able to increase the dividend and continue to push forward is to get that normalized earnings stream in a couple of quarters, $3 million plus of earnings we\u2019re getting. Long-term, we\u2019ve said many times our ultimate goal is to take about 3% of our recurring earnings and pay it out in dividends and then to use the rest for capital management. At this price we would be buying stock back and if there is a different scenario where our multiple to book and earnings multiples are higher, we might pay additional dividends, but the goal would be about 30% payout ratio of recurring earnings as we get there. Nancy Bush : Okay. Thank you. The second one is this. And this is maybe a little bit more difficult to answer. You had a good trading quarter, but we\u2019ve seen one of your competitors have a much better trading quarter. And I know that there is a mix issue there. But also as I kind of look at the composition of your businesses there, have you sort of de-risked the trading desk to the point where you can\u2019t really take full advantage of the volatility in markets? And I\u2019m wondering if you see that as the case. And secondly, if there will come a time when you\u2019re able to do some re-risking there? Brian Moynihan : I think, the Nancy what you asked is really the core question, which is, if you look a few years ago when we put core capital Global Markets out as a separate reported segment to ensure that people saw that that was a less volatile earnings stream than people perceived and it was not the earnings stream of the Global Banking segment, high investment banking which you could see the fees up or down and were relatively stable in clearly the loan book and treasury services. So we tried to sort the businesses so people can see what we\u2019re doing in the global markets. Based on our capital and based on our view of how the franchise fit together, we keep that business about a third of our total size. This total balance sheet deployed is under $600 billion and had them for years. That then requires Tom and the team to make a series of choices how they deploy that based on our appetite for risk expressed by VaR, our appetite for size expressed by the $600 billion which other people have far bigger balance sheet to deploy the business. And that does limit their ability to take risk and do certain things. So there is a mix issue based on this quarter. In other quarters we performed better relatively and that\u2019s this issue, but from a core standpoint, it\u2019s not an existential question at all. It is an actual determination we made to have our 50 buffer lower, to have our overall risk lower and demand to company which is really customer focused on the core banking middle markets franchise and the core investors. It\u2019s still be big enough to be very impactful number one research house in the world and have $3.5 billion to $4 billion of revenue in the giving quarter. We had to basically optimize around size capital, capital deployment business and then the risk we\u2019re willing to put in the P&L and that\u2019s where we ended up. And that\u2019s resulted I think 100 basis points less SIFI buffer requirement than other people. And we think that\u2019s balanced because with our book of business if we increased that we\u2019ve got to carry that 100 basis points across the whole franchise, not just the market business, and that extra capital in our balance would really increase the capital requirements that really not needed for our core banking business. Nancy Bush : So basically you are happy with the trading desk as it is? Brian Moynihan : Yes, I mean -- no, we\u2019re always never happy because we always wanted to do better. I mean, that\u2019s not -- but on the other hand, it\u2019s fair to say that we are not unsatisfied when we make almost $1 billion after tax in the quarter where they were -- where they had a couple of big elements, this mix in the macro businesses which we are positioned in on purpose. And then secondly remember the core part of our business we are still adjusting to which was the leverage finance transaction business, which you can look at is down dramatically year-over-year as we adopted the guidance and they were -- what was acquired. That\u2019s through the numbers now, and then we will build back based on that business doing it the way that meets the regulatory standard. So happy, we are never happy with any business. We are always pushing them to do better, but given the constraints there is an understanding I would say more than happiness of where we ended up. Nancy Bush : Okay. Thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead. Brennan Hawken : Hi. Good morning, guys. A quick follow-up on the op risk questions. So if we still have pending settlements out there on a few of the remaining sort of large issues, could that lead to op risk at least sustaining at elevated levels or/and could it even potentially cause a little bit of an uplift there? Bruce Thompson : Yes. I think at this point we walk through. And we said in the last call that we are at the level that we need to be from a overall op risk perspective. And to your point, if you look at the last two quarters relative to when that op risk capital was set, we\u2019ve seen fairly sizeable declines in overall litigation expense. So you obviously work through that, but our belief overtime is that number should be less, not more but we need to deliver that to the shareholder. Brennan Hawken : Yes. I mean, from your lips to God\u2019s ears, but if we still have some potential settlements my only point is that it might take a little while before we end up seeing that come down. Isn\u2019t that a similar reason? Brian Moynihan : Just as we said there is a bid ask on the RWA related to commercial credit factors and models. There was a bid ask and operating risk. We closed that out. And we\u2019ve actually moved our RWA to a number of those asks. And then from then, we just look at it very simply, think about the last four quarters versus last year and just taking up third and fourth quarter, you have a complete change in the amount of litigation expense that\u2019s gone through the enterprise and you see that keep going through. It will take a while for that to average out, but basically assume that we\u2019ve agreed to with amount which was requested to bring our op risk and we put that through last quarter. Brennan Hawken : Okay. Thanks. And then it seems some high level turnover in your equities business. Can you comment maybe on what\u2019s driving some of those departures, any potential implications and what you are doing about it? Brian Moynihan : Yes. I mean, we\u2019ve had some retirements of people worked in the business for 25 years, Henry and team, and it\u2019s just the ebb and flow of business, I don\u2019t think there is any major issues going on there. I think that [Thong Nguyen] [ph] and team have done a good job and stabilized that business and brought it back. We continue to work on the prime brokerage side to make sure that we can be positioned to sort of restart that engine of growth. Now that -- now we had both the business back, we got the operating platform in place where we wanted to be [indiscernible] not this past fall but fall before. So I think you shouldn\u2019t be thinking into that other than usual ebb and flow of people deciding to do other things. Brennan Hawken : Okay. Thanks for that color. And then the last one for me, following up on Ken's question, it sounds like the FA headcount add are sort of biased a little more to the junior side? So should we count on a bit of a headwind from that on your productivity metrics in GWIM and maybe could you also comment on the recruiting environment currently and if you still think that comp may moderate as some of those deals with FAs from crisis level sunset\u2026 Brian Moynihan : The average deal last year I think was 100, for highest end producing FAs which there were 100 up -- 120 up. The average deal was like 127 -- 1.27 times going to others that might that are fly to us and that\u2019s, don\u2019t know the exact number to think conceptually. So the rumors about these payoffs are probably far in excess. The reality is only 120 people or so. So take whatever number. So let\u2019s broaden out the productivity question, the productivity per advisor in our business is extremely strong and has sort of structurally been strong for many years and continues to increase. You wouldn\u2019t mine eluding that to get faster long-term growth prospects of the business and broaden out the business and that\u2019s what John and team are doing, whether it goes down and not really going to be a factor. How fast the revenue stream grows. It\u2019s been our growing net impact of investing in the loan business. But we aren\u2019t, yes, so I wouldn\u2019t -- I would say it\u2019s going to go down or up based on the added younger advisors, but let\u2019s flip that and say, there is the way we think this business has to drive for our competitive advantage as franchise, there is a linkage from preferred to Merrill Lynch Wealth Management and the interactions between the financial services centers and the people come in there and tens of thousands people that get referred to Merrill is a competitive advantage for Merrill. And we will continue to drive that, part of that connectivity is we are now putting Merrill team-based brokers in the branches to work with clients and ultimately move physically onto the team in the offices. So we\u2019ve got a lot of program going. They seem to be working very well. It could dilute the productivity a little bit, but it would immaterial because of the strength of the core franchise is so strong. Brennan Hawken : Thanks for the color. Operator : And we can take our final question from Jeff Harte with Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead. Brian Moynihan : Good morning, Jeff. Jeff Harte : Good morning, guys. A couple from me, first of all, you mentioned the commercial utilization rate being up a lot. Can you give me some or give us some idea of how much of that is energy complex driven versus maybe coming from other less stressed industries? Bruce Thompson : Yeah. Most of all that, given that the number I quoted was within the Commercial Bank, that\u2019s almost exclusively outside of the energy space. So it has nothing to do with anything to stress. It just core commercial plans driving more those numbers bottom down in the low 30s and they are now up in the high 30s. Yeah, think of that, when we say Commercial that\u2019s middle market, general middle market for us. Brian Moynihan : Not the Corporate Bank where the energy exposures would be so. It\u2019s back to basically where it was, not the highest point, because it\u2019s ran up right before the crisis. But if you look back it\u2019s higher than it wasn\u2019t say 4 and 5 at this point right on. So you just start to see the normalization of that borrowing, which is good news, because that means the people borrowing the money to do something. Jeff Harte : Okay. And looking at the balance sheet, I mean, can you talk a little bit about the plans, the kind of the level of excess cash, I mean, 22% of assets in cash, a 7% plus SLR ratio? It would seem awfully tough to generate ROE or ROA with that much of the balance sheet sitting in cash, is there something you can do there? Bruce Thompson : Yeah. Look, I think, the first thing, if you look that, you have to consider as that. As we went through with the different regulatory metrics we needed to get to that that the last metric that we needed to solve for and we wanted to get behind us was the satisfaction of where we needed to be from the LCR perspective in 2017 at both the bank level, as well as the parent and work to the point where we\u2019ve gotten to that point. So from an overall liquidity HQLA perspective we feel very good about that progress. As you look at on a go-forward bases, obviously, the big focus and the reason as a company that we are looking to drive the loan growth that we have is to basically take the access deposits today that are within the investment portfolio and release them from the investment portfolio into two core loan activity to do more with our clients. So as you look at the changes and mix in the balance sheet as far as the built that you\u2019ve seen with cash. I think we are at the point where from an overall balance and where we need to be with the different metrics that we\u2019ve satisfied that at this point and it will be more of a normal course on a go-forward basis. Brian Moynihan : Yeah. I think generally thematically if you think about as we see rules come up, we try to get in full compliances as fast as possible even though there is delay dates. And then you can then work back on how to continuously improve the way you get there but first thing you guys do is get over the humps because it affects every other aspect of the franchise. And so I think the LCR and case set we got over the hump 17 is two years away still and we are in compliance and then the idea is that you keep to figure out how that work to dies to make it more and more shareholder friendly overtime, but the first we want to make sure we can do. Jeff Harte : Okay. Thank you. Lee McEntire : I think that\u2019s a -- I think that was the last question. Thanks for joining today and we\u2019ll talk to you in the next quarter. Operator : This concludes the program for today. Thanks for your participation. You may now disconnect and have a nice day.",

Later you will have the opportunity to ask questions during the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Please note this call may be recorded. I'll be standing by should you need any assistance.  It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Mr. Lee McEntire. You may begin sir. Lee McEntire : Good morning. Thanks to everybody on the phone, as well as the webcast for joining us this morning for the second quarter results. Hopefully, everybody has had a chance to review the earnings release documents that are available on the website. So before I turn the call over to Brian and Bruce, let me just remind you we may make some forward-looking statements and for further information on those please refer to either our earnings release documents, our website or our SEC filings. So with that I'm pleased to turn it over to Brian Moynihan, our CEO for some opening comments, before Bruce Thompson, the CFO goes through the details. Brian? Brian T. Moynihan: Thank you, Lee, and good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us for our second quarter results.  As you can see from our release we reported $5.3 billion in after tax earnings this quarter, which is up from last quarter as well as more than double what we made last year. Not only were we pleased with the bottom line, but revenue was up and expenses were down comparably against both periods.  Lots of things came together to achieve these results and we continue to work on all these also. On the expense side we told you that we achieved this new BAC cost savings back in the third quarter of last year. However, we didn't give up on our focus on expenses and you can see those in the results. It's the lowest non-litigation expense base since 2008.  At the same time we continue to invest in the future of this company. Just to mention a few of these investments, we added sales specialists in our financial centers, up 3% versus last year. We added 3% to our financial advisers since last year, 4% to our commercial and business bankers. We've opened new financial centers in new markets that we previously didn't have coverage and we continue to upgrade those in other markets. In addition, we continue to invest in young new talent in our company. We hired a record number of teammates from college, over 1,200 and we have our intern program to over 1,800 this summer. And we continue to invest as we have said in technology, so that was $3 billion we spent this year to continue to improve and drive our products and our capabilities in the company. As we are doing that we continue to focus on our process improvement, our simplified and improved effort continues to take hold and you saw that to have some affect that this quarter. The goal of that program is to hold the costs, manage them well as the economy continues to recover and our revenues continue to recover. Away from expenses, a few other highlights for the quarter. We saw overall loan growth and balances from the first quarter. We saw continued improvement in our net charge-offs and credit quality; our deposits in our consumer continue to grow even faster this quarter than prior quarters. We also built capital and tangible book value despite the OCI impact of higher rates. We\u2019ve returned over $1.3 billion to our shareholders through share repurchases and common dividends and looking at the results this quarter you can also see that we're making progress on our path to our long-term targets of return on assets and return on tangible common equity. Bruce will take you through the business activity in the various pages in the slides with some highlights. This quarter again we averaged about 5,000 new customers a day to our mobile banking platform, but importantly the team continues to make progress in bringing that platform into the company in multiple ways. Example of that is this quarter our digital channel sales were up 30% from last year in the second quarter. In addition to that we continue to focus on our mortgage area, our direct to consumer mortgage and home equity originations improved 40% from a year ago. In the mass affluent space our Merrill Lynch product, it continues to have record assets and they were up 15% to over $122 billion and that\u2019s on top of our investment brokerage services revenue teammates in U.S. Trusts and Merrill Lynch that continues to grow. We also continue to drive our 401(k) business and this year we\u2019ve added some of the industry\u2019s largest companies to our platform. So this is the trends in the business and Bruce will cover more later. From a broad economic standpoint what do we see out there, notwithstanding uncertain economies outside United States we see the U.S. economy continues to steadily improve. In our middle market business, our commercial businesses, our company\u2019s balance sheets are strong and they continue to drive loans at a higher rate than they did last quarter. Our consumers continue to spend on our debit and credit cards, this quarter spending about $127 billion this quarter, up 3% from last year even with the down draft in gas prices in the year-over-year comparison.  Our industry leading research team under Candace's leadership and Bank of America research expects U.S. GDP growth for the second half of the year to be 3% for each of those quarters and we see that in our statistics. Our company is well-positioned to benefit from that continued health in the economy and we continue to manage this company to deliver for our customers and clients and for you our shareholders.  With that, I'll turn it over to Bruce. Bruce R. Thompson: Thanks Brian and good morning everyone. I am going to start on slide three, and let\u2019s go through the results. We recorded $5.3 billion of earnings in the second quarter or $0.45 per diluted share. This compares to $0.27 a share in the first quarter of 2015 and $0.19 in the second quarter of last year. A few items to note as you review the results. In the second quarter, we had $669 million of positive market related adjustments in net interest income, primarily driven by premium amortization on our debt securities from higher long-term rates. This provided a $0.04 benefit to EPS. The quarter also included $373 million in benefits from consumer real estate loans which added $0.02 a share. One other item worth noting is the rep and warrant provision which is a net $205 million benefit this period. This was mostly associated with positive developments in legacy mortgage related matters, which I'll discuss later in the presentation. This added a $0.01 to EPS. Revenue on an FTE basis was $22.3 billion in the second quarter and included the items that I just mentioned. Total non-interest expense in the quarter was $13.8 billion and reflects lower litigation costs, lower LAS costs and good core expense controls compared to both the first quarter of \u201815 and the second quarter of 2014. Provision for credit losses this quarter was $780 million and included improved net charge-offs on an adjusted basis as well as less reserve release compared to the first quarter of 2015. Return on tangible common equity this quarter was 12.8%, return on assets was 99 basis points and the efficiency ratio was 62%. If we adjust for those metrics for the few items I mentioned earlier, return on tangible common equity was 10.9%, return on assets was 85 basis points and the efficiency ratio was 65%. On slide four, the balance sheet was up less than 1% versus the first quarter of '15 as loan growth and higher securities balances were offset by a decline in the ending balances within our global markets business. Loans on a period end basis were up reflecting good core loan activity. All of our loan categories showed growth from the first quarter of '15 with the exception of consumer real estate, which declined from both discretionary activity as well as other one-offs. Common shareholders\u2019 equity improved, the solid earnings growth was partially offset by a $2.2 billion decline in OCI and $1.3 billion in capital return to common shareholders. We repurchased 49 million shares for $775 million and paid approximately $500 million in common dividends this quarter. Tangible book value increased to $15.02 and tangible common equity improved to 7.6%. If we look at lending activity on slide five, our reported loans on an end of period basis increased for the first time since the third quarter of 2013 growing $8.5 billion from the first quarter or 4% on an annualized basis. Activity in our discretionary portfolio which is reflected in the LAS and all other box, where we used consumer real estate loans to manage interest rate risk in the LAS unit where we have home equity run-off portfolio together showed a decline from the first quarter of '15 of $15 billion. The loan sales I mentioned earlier accounted for roughly half that amount and included certain loans with long-term standby arrangements that were converted into securities. After we exclude this activity, our core loans increased $23.5 billion or 4% from the first quarter of '15. Commercial lending was strong. Among other initiatives, the management team challenged our corporate and commercial lenders for the past several quarters to more fully utilize the credit limits, to drive responsible growth.  In that light, global banking showed a continuation of loan growth from the end of the first quarter of '15, growing $11.4 billion or 4% during the quarter from a mix of C&I across large corporate and middle market as well as growth in commercial real estate. Our wealth management business continues to experience strong demand in both securities based lending as well as consumer real estate. And our consumer banking area grew both card and auto loans. We move to regulatory capital on slide six. Under the transition rules our CET1 ratio improved to 11.2% in the second quarter. If we look at our Basel III regulatory capital on a fully phased-in basis, CET1 capital improved $1.1 billion driven by earnings partially offset by the OCI decline, share repurchases and dividends. Under the standardized approach, our CET1 ratio was steady at 10.3% as RWA was stable with the first quarter of '15. Under the advanced approaches, CET1 ratio increased from 10.1% to 10.4% as RWA improved by approximately $34 billion. Lower counterparty RWA drove this decline and was equally split between three factors. The first, lower derivative exposures, mainly driven by movements in both rates as well as FX. Second, optimization through better collateral management and reductions in certain positions. And third, an increase in the population of trades eligible for model treatment. The balance of the improvement was driven by lower levels of market risk. In regards to the Fed's requested modifications to models in order to exit the parallel run that we have previously communicated to you, at the end of the quarter we estimate if we made the requested modifications that our advanced approaches CET1 ratio would be approximately 9.3% at June 30th. Moving to our supplementary leverage ratios we estimate that at the end of the second quarter we continue to exceed the U.S. rules that are applicable in 2018. Our bank holding company SLR ratio was approximately 6.3%, while the primary bank subsidiary BANA was approximately 7%. If we turn to slide seven, on funding and liquidity, long-term debt of $243 billion was up $6 billion from the first quarter as issuances outpaced maturities. As you can see from the maturity profile we have $10 billion of parent company debt scheduled to mature in the rest of 2015 and we'll continue to be opportunistic in regards to issuance. Our global excess liquidity sources reached a record level during the quarter at $484 billion and now represents 23% of the overall balance sheet. The increase from the first quarter of GELS reflects a continued shift from discretionary loans into HQLA securities as well as the increased debt balances. Our parent company liquidity increased to $96 billion and our time to required funding improved to 40 months. And at the end of the second quarter we estimate that the consolidated company was well above the 100% fully phased-in 2017 requirement for the liquidity ratio. If we turn to slide eight, our net interest income on a reported FTE basis was $10.7 billion, an increase of $1 billion from the first quarter of \u201915. Volatility of long end rates over the past few quarters has clearly caused some variability in our reported NII. The market related adjustment from our bond premium amortization this quarter was a benefit of $669 million, as rates rose 40 basis points in the quarter, while in the first quarter of \u201915 we reported a negative $484 million adjustment from a decline in rates in the period. If we adjust for those items our NII declined approximately a $100 million from the first quarter of \u201915 to just over $10 billion, as the impact of lower discretionary balances in consumer loan yields more than offset the impact of one more day of interest. At the end of the second quarter an instantaneous 100 basis point parallel shift and increase in rates would be expected to contribute roughly $3.9 billion in NII benefits over the following 12 months and that split roughly 60% to short-end rates and 40% to long-end rates. Given the movement higher in long-end rates, our balance sheet did become less sensitive to long-end rates compared to March 31st as we realized some of that sensitivity through FAS 91 in the second quarter. As you can see on slide nine, non-interest expense was $13.8 billion in the second quarter and included a $175 million in litigation expense. Litigation expense did decline significantly from the second quarter of \u201914 levels. If we exclude litigation expenses were $13.6 billion in the quarter, a decline of $900 million or 6% from the second quarter of 2014. On balance we\u2019re quite pleased with our year-over-year expense improvement even while we continue to invest in the franchise. In the third quarter of \u201914 we wrapped up the new BAC cost savings initiatives and several quarters later we continue to see good progress on operating cost reductions in LAS, as well as in other areas. Our headcount is down 7% compared to the second quarter of \u201914 and as a reminder we do expect to incur some cost associated with our CCAR resubmission through the balance of the year. If we go ahead and switch to asset quality on slide 10, reported net charge-offs were $1.1 billion versus $1.2 billion in the first quarter of \u201915. Both periods include charge-offs associated with the August 2014 DOJ settlement which we had previously reserved for. If we exclude these impacts and a small impact from recoveries on NPL sales our core net charge-offs declined $75 million from the first quarter of \u201915 to $929 million. Loss rates on the same adjusted basis improved to 43 basis points in the second quarter of \u201915. U.S. consumer credit card delinquencies improved as well and on the commercial front we saw an uptick in NPLs and reservable criticized exposure from the first quarter driven by downgrades in oil and gas exposures. Despite these downgrades we feel good about our exposure in this area as they are well collateralized and most of these credits only had a one level migration on a risk rating scale. The second quarter provision expense was $780 million and we released a net $288 million in reserves which includes the utilization of previously accrued DOJ reserves. Releases in consumer card and consumer real estate were partially offset by reserve bills within the commercial loan growth area.  Let\u2019s go ahead and move to the businesses on slide 11, Consumer banking had earnings of $1.7 billion which was 4% greater than the second quarter of 2014 and 16% above the first quarter of \u201915 level. This in turn generated a strong 24% return on allocated capital. Within revenue fees were up 2% from last year driven by higher card and higher mortgage banking revenue, but this growth was more than offset by a decline in net interest income. The decline in net interest income is a result of the allocated impact of our ALM activities as well as some compression in card loan yields. Provision decreased $44 million from the second quarter of '14 driven by the continued improvement that we saw in both the credit card as well as the auto portfolios. Our non-interest expense was down 4% from the second quarter of '14 as we reduced the number of financial centers and associated costs and personnel. The cost of average deposits ratio is now less than a 175 basis points and we have a 57% efficiency ratio within this segment. This business is a good representation of how the company is doing more business while we continue to reduce expenses.  We also continue to experience a shift in consumer behavior patterns away from branches and towards more self-service. For example, the number of mobile banking customers continues to grow and increased to more than $17.6 million customers this quarter and these customers look to mobile devices for approximately 13% of all transactions -- all deposit transactions. If we look at some of the key drivers and trends within the consumer area on slide 12, we remain a leader in many aspects of consumer banking, doing business with roughly half of all U.S. households.  Let's look at card activity. Card income increased 5% from the second quarter of '14 on strong sales and solid spend levels. Card issuance reached almost $1.3 million units in the quarter on increased sales efforts while the average book FICO score was also strong. Average loan balances were down slightly from the second quarter of '14 as we do see customers paying down more of the balances. Net charge-offs declined from very low levels and were 2.7% in the second quarter and risk adjusted margins remained high at roughly 9%. Mortgage banking income in this segment was up 8% from last year as originations had nice follow through from the elevated pipeline at the end of the first quarter as well as the higher productions margins. First mortgage originations for the total company were $16 billion, up 44% year-over-year and up 16% from the first quarter of '15. Home equity line and loan originations increased 23% to $3.2 billion from the year ago quarter and were stable with the first quarter. Revenue improvement versus the second quarter of '14 was driven by improved margins. Although the mortgage pipeline remained solid it is down 15% from the end of the first quarter driven in part by higher rates. Service charges were down modestly versus the second quarter of '14. This fee line item does continue to be somewhat muted as we continue to open higher quality accounts and those accounts are carrying higher balances. Compared to the second quarter of '14 our average deposits of $545 billion are up $31 billion or 6% even as we lowered the rates paid which now stands at five basis points. Lastly, while we are bringing down our overall headcount in this business, we continue to invest in the growth opportunity of our preferred client base and we've been increasing sales specialists in the financial centers and that's resulted in increased activity. If we turn to slide 13, Global wealth and investment management produced earnings of $690 million, which was up 6% from the first quarter of '15 level but down 5% from the second quarter of '14. Compared to the second quarter of '14 solid fee growth was offset by lower net interest income, higher credit cost and modestly higher expenses, which resulted in a decline in year-over-year results. The allocation of the impact of our company's ALM activities more than offset the NII benefits that we had from solid loan growth within the space. Year-over-year non-interest income was up 4% on strong asset management results. Non-interest expense was modestly higher in the second quarter on the strength of our asset management fees as well as the continuing investment in client facing professionals. The year-over-year increase in provision reflects larger reserve release in the prior periods. Pretax margin was 24% and the return on allocated capital remained strong at 23%.  If we look at activity and drivers on slide 14, asset management fees continue to grow and are up 9% from the second quarter of '14. This was partially offset by sluggishness of transactional revenue in the brokerage business. We did increase our financial advisers by 6% over the last 12 months and we feel good about the number of advisers that are joining us from competitors. Client balances are above $2.5 trillion, up almost $12 billion from the first quarter of '15 driven by solid client balance inflows as well as improved market valuations. Long-term AUM flows were $9 billion for the quarter and that's the 24th consecutive quarter where we've seem positive flows. As I mentioned earlier we continue to experience strong demand in both our securities based and residential mortgage lending areas and we reached a new record for loans within the space during the quarter. We turn to slide 15; global banking earnings were $1.3 billion, which is 14% on allocated capital. Earnings did decline 13% from the second quarter of '14 as lower non-interest expense was more than offset by lower net interest income, lower investment banking revenues and higher provision expense that was associated with the strong loan growth that we saw during the quarter. The year-over-year decline in net interest income reflects the allocation of our ALM activity and liquidity costs as well as some compression in loan spreads. Non-interest expense did decline 3% from the second quarter of '14 as lower litigation and other technology initiative costs were partially offset by investment in client-facing personnel.  If we look at the trends on slide 16, we chart the components of revenue. Investment banking fees for the company were $1.5 billion, down 6% from the near record levels that we experienced during the second quarter of '14. Advisory fees were up 5% during the quarter, debt underwriting was relatively stable as increased activity in the investment grade and other products offset the declines that we saw within our leverage finance area. Equity underwriting was down 19% from what was a record level for our company in the second quarter of 2014. Outside of investment banking fees other banking revenue declined from leasing gains partially offset by modestly higher treasury fees and card income.  If we look at the balance sheet, loans on average were $301 billion, up 4% from both the year-over-year and linked-quarter periods. The growth was broad-based across both corporate and commercial borrowers. Although average deposits were relatively stable versus the second quarter of '14 we did see a favorable shift in mix with our non-interest bearing deposits up over $20 billion and our interest bearing deposits down $17 billion versus the second quarter of '14. This growth in non-interest bearing balances was driven by a continuing focus on the growth within operating balances. The decline in interest bearing balances was driven by targeted reductions in these low liquidity value deposits. Switching to global markets on slide 17, in the second quarter earnings were $1 billion on revenues of $4.3 billion. We generated 11% return on capital in this business during the quarter. Earnings were up modestly from the first quarter of '15 levels, which included higher litigation, but down from the second quarter of '14 as revenue declined. Total revenue, excluding net DVA declined from the second quarter driven by lower equity investment gains, lower sales and trading results and lower investment banking fees. If we exclude a $188 million difference between periods on the sale of an equity investment, revenue was down 4% in the second quarter. Non-interest expense was reduced 5% from that same period, in line with the revenue reductions. We focused on the sales and trading performance components on slide 18. Sales and trading revenue of $3.3 billion ex-net DVA is down 2% from the second quarter of '14 levels. Compared with the same period a year ago, fixed sales and trading was down 9% and not unlike what we saw in the first quarter of '15 strength within the macro-related products like FX, rates and commodities was offset by lower levels of activity within the credit product space. And to remind you our mix does remain more heavily weighted to credit products based on the size of our new issue business.  Equity's trading was up 13% year-over-year driven largely by increased client activity within the Asia Pacific region as well as a strong performance within the derivative area. Slide 19 shows our legacy assets and servicing business, where we were profitable during the quarter given the net benefit in our rep and warrant provision. Revenue excluding this benefit did decline from the first quarter of '15 on less favorable MSR hedge performance as well as lower servicing revenue. Litigation expense declined significantly from the second quarter of '14. Non-interest expense ex-litigation was roughly $900 million this quarter improving $122 million from the first quarter of \u201815 and $526 million going back to the second quarter of '14. We remain on track to hit our fourth quarter goal of approximately $800 million in LAS cost ex-litigation. We were also pleased that during the quarter our number of 60 plus day delinquent loans decreased to 132,000 units. That's down 14% from the first quarter and almost 50% from the prior period of last year. Before I move away from the mortgage space let me mention an important development in our legacy mortgage exposures. This quarter there was a closely watched case in New York's highest court which confirmed that the New York's six year statute of limitation on filing rep and warrant claims begins to run at the time the reps and warranties are made and not at some later point in time. Based on our review of the relevant documents we believe the vast majority of the bank's remaining PRs representation on warranty obligations are governed by New York law. As a result of the case ruling you can see on slide 20, a significant $7.6 billion reduction in our gross outstanding private label claims as a result of certain claims now being time barred. This ruling also had positive implications on our rep and warrant provision, as I mentioned, as well as the range of possible loss above those reserves. You\u2019ll recall the RPL had been a range of up to $4 billion for several years and so that the top end of that range has now been reduced to up to $2 billion. On slide 21 we show all other. The $637 million of earnings this quarter resulted in a swing in profitability is a result of the improvement in the NII market related adjustment from quarter-to-quarter as well as the prior period inclusion of the annual retirement eligible incentive cost. The loan sales, I mentioned earlier are also included in revenue. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 29% and I would expect the tax rate to be roughly 30% for the rest of 2015, absent unusual items like the recent UK tax reform proposals. Among the UK proposals where a reduction in the corporate tax rate, a surcharge tax on bank earnings and a reduction in the bank levy rate.  Our preliminary read is that we could have a one-time charge of several hundred million dollars later in this year to re-price our UK deferred tax assets upon enactment. At this time on an ongoing basis we expect the recurring tax impact to be modest. Before wrapping up on this slide, let me remind you that our preferred dividends in the third quarter should be $440 million and $330 million in the fourth quarter of this year. So to wrap up, as Brian started the presentation with, many things that our teams have been focused on for some time came together nicely this quarter and that enabled us to report more than $5 billion in earnings and move closer to our long-term targets. Revenue reflected relative stability. We lowered cost, we grew loans nicely, credit quality remains very good and we're focused on operating leverage within the business. The foundation of the company's balance sheet has never been stronger with record capital and record liquidity levels and we remain well-positioned to benefit from a rising rate environment. With that, let's go ahead and open it up for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Betsy Graseck : Hi. Good morning. Brian T. Moynihan: Good morning. Betsy Graseck : The question I am getting from people this morning is around the expenses. You showed some very nice improvement in core expenses coming down meaningfully Q - on-Q and year-over-year, and the question is have we reached the end stage here or is there any further opportunity to bring down expenses from here? Bruce R. Thompson: I think that\u2019s in the broadest context we continue to work expenses and if we talk to, about each quarter 18 straight quarter reduction in core operating expenses outside litigation, 15 straight quarters, 3,000 people or more reduction each quarter. So we just continue to apply technology to continue to long-term reduce expenses. So the goal we have in some is to keep the expenses flat as revenue increases and if the world economic situation changes, different what we were expecting we would have to look at it differently but as you can see this quarter that will result in a constant downward pressure given where we are in the economy. Betsy Graseck : Okay and then on the reps and warranty side you had what looks like a little bit of a true up based on this litigation decision. Is that the right way of reading it or is there potentially even more to come in the future as you go through each case? Bruce R. Thompson: No, clearly what the case is significant, is this Betsy we look to add and as do every quarter, look at the rep and warrant provision, and you are right it was a net benefit of $200 million this quarter. I think the important thing; I think more than the $200 million is that if you look back on our slide 20 in the earnings materials the effect of the decision led to two things that do reduce tail risk on a go forward basis. The first is you can see the number of new claims that came was just over $200 million, which is a dramatic improvement from what we\u2019ve seen historically. And second as a result of the time barring of certain claims that the outstanding claims that we have, and keep in mind these outstanding claims are based on original UPB, came down fairly significantly to just below $19 billion.  So while it was nice to have the modest benefit that we did in the quarter, I think importantly on a go forward basis it does reduce the tail risk, that\u2019s out there and we saw some of the benefits from that in the activity level this quarter. Betsy Graseck : Okay thanks. And then just one last question, you indicated the upside that you have in the event of rate rise, $3.9 billion if the parallel shift is 100 basis points, the question is how you are thinking about dropping that to the bottom line? Is there reinvestments that would take up some of that or are you at sufficient run rate in investment spends that you would be able to drop more to the bottom line? Bruce R. Thompson: I think there is no question Betsy as we look at and I just remind people that we were at $3.9 billion for 100 basis point move. If you look at that roughly 60% of it\u2019s on the short end now 40% of it\u2019s on the long end and there is no question that we would expect to drop a significant portion of that to the bottom line if and when we see that 100 basis point move. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And then just back to the expense side the expense run rate that you\u2019ve got right now is something you think you can hold, at least if not improve from here, is that fair? Brian T. Moynihan: Yeah. That\u2019s really in your last question we\u2019ve been investing in headcount to open up our customer facing capacity, so I replicated some of statistics earlier. So we are comfortable from a technology spend rate from an investment client facing capacity, marketing and everything we had a good run rate so there will be downward pressure as headcount continues to come down through the application of technology across the platform of customers and internally.  So we\u2019re comfortable that we can continue to drive it, and make no bones about it this is what we work on every day and we are yet to put out a dollar target because frankly that tells the team we\u2019ve made a goal and stop as opposed to just get better at it every day. So we just want that we are constantly working to improve the dynamics of revenue versus expense in this company. Betsy Graseck : Thanks a lot. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Matt O'Connor from Deutsche Bank. Matthew D. O'Connor: Good morning. If you look at the core net interest income ex the market related marks, it was down little bit versus last quarter but you are starting to see loans inflect as you mentioned earlier. Do we start seeing stability in the core net interest income looking at the next quarter or two or do we really need higher short-term rates for that? Brian T. Moynihan: No, thanks for the question. It\u2019s a good question. I think if you look at, we typically have a little bit of seasonal pressure in the second quarter and as we sit here today, based on the curve we would expect to see the core net interest income, which obviously excludes FAS 91 move up from Q2 to Q3 and we\u2019d expect further growth from Q3 to Q4. Matthew D. O'Connor: Okay and that\u2019s without any benefit from rates? Brian T. Moynihan: It\u2019s just based on the realization of what the existing curve is, which quite frankly we don\u2019t look at and our models don\u2019t show fed funds going up until January of 2016. So there\u2019s not a lot of great benefit in that at all. Matthew D. O'Connor: Okay, and then on the discretionary book you mentioned it came down a little bit, when you look on a combined securities, mortgages basis and I guess as we saw long term rates go up and some banks have been increasing the discretionary book, with higher reinvestment rates or higher investment rates herein, what\u2019s your thought on bringing that book down as rates have gone up? Brian T. Moynihan: Okay, two comments, I think. The first is that when we talk about the discretionary balances coming down that\u2019s basically the whole loan portfolio as well as certain pieces of the home equity portfolio. So we referenced that those came down about $15 billion quarter-over-quarter; half due to the sales and half due to pay downs. We probably have one more quarter where you will see some of the conversion of those loans to securities. But if you actually look at the amount of securities from a balance perspective they went up a little bit Q1 to Q2 based on the conversion of those loans to securities and as we continue to see the deposit footprint grow we will continue to invest and we\u2019re obviously mindful of the balance between increasing net income interest, like I spoke about as well as being sensitive to OCI risk. Matthew D. O'Connor: Okay, thank you very much. Brian T. Moynihan: Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Jim Mitchell from Buckingham Research. Your line is open. James Mitchell : Hey, good morning. Brian T. Moynihan: Good morning. James Mitchell : Just a quick follow up on the NIM outlook, I think first, Bruce last quarter you mentioned that the yield curve stayed where it was, you talked about $600 million of drag in NII over the next few quarters. Are you saying that that\u2019s pretty much changed with this deepening of the curve since April, when you spoke last, and not only NII is growing but NIM should stabilize or is it just sort of offsetting each other, or you are getting a boost from that, how do we think about the yield curve versus your prior comment? Bruce R. Thompson: Yeah, I think again, as we look and step forward that there are a lot of things that influence that number, one is obviously the ability and how much we\u2019ve put up the increase in deposits to work through growing loans, and clearly we\u2019ve seen, during the second quarter we saw that loan growth move up, which is obviously a good thing, which lessens some of that sensitivity. And as we look at the amount and what we\u2019re doing from an investment portfolio that there is less to do during the second half of the year. So all-in-all as we look at those different factors it\u2019s why we\u2019re comfortable saying that we\u2019d expect the quarter increase both Q2 to Q3 as well as from Q3 to Q4. James Mitchell : That\u2019s fair enough. And just on the capital side, when do you think the modifications become official and you exit the parallel run, how long do we think we have to wait for that and is there anything that could change in terms of your expectation around I guess the 90 basis point hit to your CT1? Bruce R. Thompson: I think, I\u2019d say that we can\u2019t say too much about regulatory matters. I think given the updated disclosure we have given you can assume that we\u2019re getting closer to having that result. You never know until you\u2019re ultimately done. But we feel very comfortable with the guidance of 9.3% factoring in the adjustments based on where we were at the end of the second quarter and we\u2019ll look to get that wrapped up sooner than later. James Mitchell : Okay, that\u2019s helpful and just one last quick one on the $3.9 billion of sensitivity to higher rates, how much is FAS 91 related versus for the core? Bruce R. Thompson: Sure, as I mentioned roughly 40% of its long end which is a $1.5 billion of the amount and roughly half of that\u2019s FAS 91 and half of it\u2019s non-FAS 91 related. James Mitchell : Okay, thanks a lot. Operator : Our next question is from John E. McDonald from Bernstein. Your line is open. John E. McDonald : Hi, thanks. Bruce, just one more question on the rate sensitivity, the $3.9 billion move for a 100 basis point parallel move, I assume that illustration is to a 100 basis points move, that\u2019s a shock or an instantaneous move in rates. Can you give us any feel for how that number would change if the move in rates is more gradual, as the Fed is kind of saying if I go gradually, how does that change if it's not instantaneous? Bruce R. Thompson: Well, I mean ultimately overtime if you get to the 100 basis point number you have that. I think your point is, is that, if they move 25 basis points, is it 25% or is it more than 25%. And I think that the thing you have you to keep in mind, and we've talked about it a lot with what we would expect from a deposit re-pricing perspective, is that, that clearly you'd expect the first 25 to 50 basis points move up that we would not have to do much from a deposit perspective. So net-net on a relative basis that should be a positive as you look at the numbers. John E. McDonald : Okay, and then a clarification, where is the gain on consumer real-estate loans, is that in the mortgage banking line? Bruce R. Thompson: No, it's in other income. And it's reflected in the all other segment. John E. McDonald : Okay. The mortgage banking income was very strong and the fee income line obviously had the rep and warrant in there. Was there anything else in there that helped on the mortgage banking line? Bruce R. Thompson: I would say that generally that the hedge results on the MSR were fairly decent in the quarter and then you can see, like we said there just wasn\u2019t much litigation during the quarter as well. So all of those things led to the results being where they are. But you're right that we've typically had 100 to 200 of rep and warrant provision and we had 200 benefits that you get a sense of the magnitude of the swing on a comparable period basis. John E. McDonald : Got it, got it, okay. And then last question from me on the credit, do you see the net charge offs kind of dancing around the current level, the $929 million. And how you see it playing out in terms of provision, reserve release relative to what you just did this quarter? Bruce R. Thompson: Yeah, I think this quarter I think you're seeing kind of a continuation of what we've been talking about. And I want to be careful that we're -- particularly we need to exclude DOJ book both on the top, as you did in your 929 number as well as in the reserve release. So if you back out what we had for DOJ the reserve release was about 150. The charge-offs of $929 million were down roughly $75 million. And while this can bounce around a little bit I think what you're likely to see over the next couple of quarters is probably a convergence where the charge-offs and the provision number become more closely aligned. And I would just say that particularly on the consumer side we continue to like what we see on credit. And on the commercial side you can see that the charge-offs are virtually nil within the large corporate space. And there is nothing that we see out there that's going to change that materially. John E. McDonald : Okay, and on top of that will the DOJ still be a factor for next couple of quarters? Bruce R. Thompson: As it relates to that I want to think John that it will be in the $100 million type area, as it relates to both charge-off and reserve release. And then by the time we get to the fourth quarter it should virtually go away. It can bounce around a little bit, but it should largely be gone by the end of the third quarter. Brian T. Moynihan: But it's pares off John. So the way you expect this quarter to continue. So you know it\u2019s a number that\u2019s offset by our previously established reserve. John E. McDonald : Got it, okay. Thank you. Bruce R. Thompson: Thank you. Operator : And our next question is from Glenn Schorr from Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Glenn Schorr : Hi, thanks. Two quick ones on the average balance sheet. When you look at the debt securities line, the yields went up some [indiscernible] lot from 2% to 3.2%. I'm assuming some of that is LAS loans converting. But could you give a little color on what drives that because the overall size of those book didn\u2019t change that much. Bruce R. Thompson: Yeah, it's interesting if you look year-over-year and you adjust for FAS 91, which shows up in the NII, when you're looking back at the table, that the yields were almost identical from the second quarter of '14 to the second quarter of '15 once you make that 91 adjustment. Glenn Schorr : Okay, similar but different question. Inside the C&I book, the used commercial book, it was just a four basis point drop quarter-on-quarter but there is growth there. So I'm just curious the trade-off between price and yield give up on the new loans you're putting on versus the responsible growth you've talked about, doesn't seem that bad. I'm just curious on what kind of yield you're putting new loans on. Bruce R. Thompson: Sure, and I think when you look at commercial loan spreads, there are two things that those numbers reflect, I think that there is -- the first thing which is just from a macro perspective that has been a little bit of compression, although, we're seeing it slow is it relates to just the competitive landscape and where the loans are getting done. As it relates to your question about the new loans, the responsible growth, if you looked and particularly in the areas that picked up during the second quarter, that on our risk rating scale they would translate to credits that tend to be in the strong triple B or single A area. So they are largely investment grade type credits where we are extending it. And if you look at average spreads in that area they tend to be in the LIBOR plus 150 type area on average, which is a little bit lower than the average across the commercial platform, but as you can see the credit\u2019s clearly at the upper end. Brian T. Moynihan: So Glenn, broadly stated, if you think about it, we are not -- on a credit structure we held our discipline. On price there has been pressure but you then you have to look at that whole relation [ph] basis with the other fees and revenue you get from cash management stuff and we try to [ph] have our client focused discipline to it, but your observation is right, there is little pressure on those spreads due to that. Glenn Schorr : Okay, I definitely appreciate that. Last one is when you talk about the pushing for growth and you mentioned the difference specialists in the branches, the business banking, the financial investment consultants, I am curious what are you doing to incent them, to encourage them, in other words are there actual incentives or do they get paid on the productions? Brian T. Moynihan: In the sales context there is -- there are incentives for production, but it has to be done the right way with the right customers and with the right structure. So it is not -- it doesn\u2019t drive their behavior. It\u2019s different than the wealth management business in terms of the balance between incentives but if they are okay to open -- the mortgage loan officers are paid to produce mortgages and to open up checking accounts and other things. But it\u2019s really, it\u2019s actually deploying the people and building the capacity to sell, as we are reducing the need for services through all the automation that\u2019s going on and then shifting that group of people so that, it\u2019s really just having more of them then think of it as incentive driven behavior.  And then really then, having the information at the point of a sale through our technology, offers that have been made to people for credit cards and et cetera, so that you can make the offer again, that\u2019s already been made to them, on mine [ph] or something. So it\u2019s commonly just sales practice is more people and then just the discipline of the team, Tom, Glenn and Dean [indiscernible], then it would be incentive driven. Glenn Schorr : All right, thanks very much. Operator : Our next is from Eric Wasserstrom from Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open. Eric Wasserstrom : Thanks very much. Just to follow up a little bit on that last point, when I was trying to shift through the core loan growth numbers this morning, it looked like the core loan growth coming out of the institutional bank and the wealth management looks strong. But the -- I am still unclear what the core level of growth was inside the consumer organization and so I am just trying to reconcile that with where the incremental hiring is occurring on the sales front. So could you just clarify what the core level of customer growth was? Brian T. Moynihan: Well, if you look at -- I think in the consumer on page five you can see the balances, then you can see the different pieces. We have changed our practice of how we book residential mortgages for our consumer customers, that had impact on that, but overall remember they are still fighting a couple -- we are still fighting a couple of things in consumer, one is the card balances have probably [ph] stabilized and you saw it from our first quarter, second quarter a slight uptick there. That\u2019s because we had -- we\u2019ve been hitting increasingly record sales of credit card, so I think we did about $1.3 million this quarter, Bruce. That is again a record for us since we changed the business model six-seven years ago.  And if you look at things like the home equity balances and things like that, those were under pressure just because we are still seeing significant repayments even though we are producing a lot in that area. So if you look at that you can see it\u2019s across the board just little bit upside still, in part the interplay between some of the run off in the other category and the build-up in residential but they do a lot more themselves, loans in that place and so the investment sales levels that drives that Merrill Edge, in fact the FSA and the branches that we deploy do $4 million of notional on average a month of new investment products in building $4 million to $5 million, they sell, obviously check accounts, net check-in accounts this quarter we had a net check-in account growth position even taking into account the run off from divestitures and other things, and then you have the loan side.  So they are responsible for driving all that and so it shows up in the loans a little bit, that\u2019s why the fee categories are stable in other areas. Eric Wasserstrom : And so do you have a sense or is there some sense maybe Brian you can give us to how that investment in sort of front office staff is contributing to growth outside of the segment? Brian T. Moynihan: Well -- in the small business arena, the first half of the year we get about $5 billion of originations in what the -- what we would define the small business, we have across two divisions and they helped grow that. Merchant services growth it fell, that goes into the business banking segment -- the global banking segment. And they send [ph] about 20,000 customers here in the wealth management, that literally walk in our branch are wealthy and they get moved over and that helps our wealth management business.  So you can think of them - you're right that sales force -- that [ph] segment that it has a benefit across the board, and then services, a lot of our customers business, business banking, commercial banking customers coming to the branches obviously for cash related, really to the cash management revenue. So it is across the board and contributes and so the good news is they are making more money than they may have last year on their own. But it's still providing that services and capabilities across the platform. Eric Wasserstrom : And so and this is just my final question, with the -- if we divorce just the run off from some of the legacy asset that's still occurring, would you expect the core consumer asset growth to accelerate as a consequence of this investment or do you think that it's currently run rating [ph]? Brian T. Moynihan: The run off subsides in the consumer category, this is consumer banking here and then you've got the LAS piece, the LAS will continue to grow down because frankly those products we put in there -- we could decide not to do it but in consumer you should see as its stabilizes you will see a little better loan growth but remember they've focused on the response, of our responsive growth. We're not going to open up the credit card business in a way that will produce charge offs later down the road that we won't be happy with. So we are driving that growth into the core strong credit quality that we want to have in this company and [indiscernible] assuming that this leads to because to do that you have go in the credit postures that we won\u2019t do. Bruce R. Thompson: And I would just add if I may, if you look at home equity it's a good example of where, if you look within the consumer banking space and during the second quarter of this year the home equity originations of line amounts were about $3.2 billion. They were to loan to value less than 60%. FICOs deep into the 700s, and so there were more than $3 billion of those booked. That\u2019s number one market share, roughly a $1.5 billion of that was funded but you do have some of the legacy stuff that running off. So I think when you wonder about activity levels and what's happening, I think you need to realize that with that number one share and what we are doing it is growing. It\u2019s just there is a run off that mutes that effect. Eric Wasserstrom : Great, thanks very much for the answers to my question. Bruce R. Thompson: Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Ken Usdin from Jefferies. Your line is open. Ken Usdin : Thanks, good morning. First question just on the RWA, looks like when you look at the reconciliation of the move to fully phased-in, there's a little bit of a help on the advanced models this quarter. I just, in a general sense obviously we still have that finalization to come but what additional tweaks that you are working on inside the modules and what additional mitigation could we still see from here on the RWA side? Bruce R. Thompson: Ken, if I may, there are couple of things. We are obviously working hard to move there\u2019s many of the exposures from CEM treatment to IMM treatment, which generally has had favorable benefit there. The second thing I talked about better collateral management as well as looking to work, to do more compression and to net things out and we continue to see some benefit there. The third is we continue to move out and we're largely through this but as we continue to move out some of the non-performing consumer real estate as well as the benefits of improved consumer credit quality we're seeing benefits there and there are still a lot of few RMBS and other type positions that we would expect to get benefit for over the next couple of quarter. So I think that this quarter was clearly a quarter between the activity that we undertook as well as what happened from a rates and FX perspective where we saw pretty good quarter-over-quarter improvement and obviously there was not only in the markets business but also in the consumer businesses. Brian T. Moynihan: That's said, Bruce the other thing, we have a healthy dose of operating capital due to the operating risk embedded from the country wide [ph] and other things that we have to figure out over time, how we can work through the system because we never did the activities in the company. But on the other hand we had to deal with the cost of them and so both operating and general. So as you think about that longer-term we have to get the more rational deal, or better offering result to the company today which is different, but that will take time, and working through the models there too. Ken Usdin : Okay and then my second question, this just relates to the wealth management business and Bruce you alluded to there being a little bit of a slow down on the revenue. So if I look at the segment or the line item on the income statement, there has been a deceleration, advisor productivity looks a little bit lower and you've added a lot of people, you have added a lot of assets. So I'm just wondering what do we need to see to get a re-acceleration of the revenue side and brokerage and wealth management and is it -- or is it just the time lag relative to those additions? Bruce R. Thompson: Couple of points in that. I think first that there is clearly a building up of advisors, particularly if we're bringing them in and training them, that there is a ramp up in productivity that occurs. I don't think there is any question. The second thing that I do think is important is that when you look at the net interest income line, that as I've mentioned it looked a little bit muted. If you saw gross loan net interest income you would see those increasing.  So some of the push out of the ALM activities has muted the NII line a little bit. And then the third thing which you referenced that I do think is a little bit more of a trend that and I think is not only -- is somewhat consistent with some of the regulatory standards which we're seeing more and more of the assets that we manage being managed on a long term basis, where we were managing them, and so that's leading to growth in the asset management fees. And the corollary to that is that you do have lower brokerage income. But net-net you can see that we are growing in the segment and we feel good about the activity that we are seeing there. Brian T. Moynihan: Yeah, I say, a few quarters we saw the margin, the pretax margin come down and you are seeing it start to turn back and go up, and there is positive pressure on the future on that after the end of this year because some of the deal stuff runs out will add a couple of points to margin. It\u2019s in the numbers this year, but won\u2019t be in the numbers next year. And then your point as the maturity of the investment cycle, so because we are adding the financial advisors, the folks are coming in, they are building the books and as that maturity happens you\u2019ll see it get a little better. But the encouraging signs we\u2019re seeing the margin come back up. And remember this business also benefits a lot by the rate changes too ultimately, it is a -- it\u2019s a big bang. It\u2019s got $250 billion deposits, round numbers, a lot of loans and it has a lot of the same sensitivity our consumer bank does, that people don't think of in this context.  So as we think about the comp structure is in place, but there is added deal piece that runs off. You are seeing the maturity cycle that people coming up and the team is just working hard on the revenue expense management and we start to see some better signs. They got some work to do still left. Ken Usdin : Understood. Okay, thanks guys. Bruce R. Thompson: Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Steven Chubak from Nomura. Your line is open. Steven Chubak : Hey, good morning. So I have a couple of questions on the topic of capital. The first is a follow-up to Ken's earlier question regarding RWA mitigation potential and Bruce, I do appreciate the color you cited relating to all the mitigation opportunities on the horizon. I'm just trying to get a better sense, given your efforts to grow the core loan portfolio, how we should be thinking about the trajectory in advance RWAs? Maybe excluding the upward adjustment tied to regulatory guidance. Just to give us a sense as to what that trajectory should look like over the next couple of quarters. Bruce R. Thompson: Let\u2019s make the caveat that this assumes that we don't have a significant change one way or -- in market conditions because obviously there is a part of Basel III, that\u2019s somewhat pro-cyclical. But I think net-net if we do a good job of managing this the way that we would expect to, that absent any exogenous changes we should be able, in the institutional business, which is both global banking as well as sales and trading, that we should be able to grow loans while at the same time having -- have reductions in the overall risk weighted assets that are attributed to that area.  Now where you will probably see it be more dollar-for-dollar is obviously under standardized those loans tend to be -- every dollar of loan is a dollar of RWA. So you have to be a little bit careful between which method you are looking at. Steven Chubak : Okay, well presumably the focus, at least on your part is going to be on mitigating the advance RWAs given that, that appears to be your longer term binding constraint? Bruce R. Thompson: It\u2019s both, because you\u2019re right, as it relates to a ratio pro forma for this, it is the lower number but keep in mind you have to keep the focus on standardized as well because at least based on last year\u2019s CCAR, as well as guidance that\u2019s out there, standardized is very important from a CCAR perspective. Steven Chubak : I understood, okay, and actually it\u2019s a great transition to my next question, on the topic of G-SIB surcharges, where I'm sure you\u2019re aware there\u2019s been some discussion around the possibility of incorporating the surcharges within CCAR and I was just hoping to get a better sense as to what contingency plans you might have in place if the surcharges were to be included and are there opportunities that you see to sufficiently mitigate the G-SIB indicators so that you could move into a lower bucket? Bruce R. Thompson: A couple of things on that front, the first is as it relates to G-SIBs, their application, where they may or may not be used, at this point while we participate in industry forums, I think that the supervisory has been very transparent in sharing much of the same things that they share with us, you\u2019re also aware of. So I think that the information is fairly disseminated amongst everyone.  As it relates to contingency planning it\u2019s really an ongoing continuation of what we did from 2013 to 2014, which if you recall is it related to our qualitative CCAR results in a timeframe where we didn\u2019t have significant levels of net income, that our CCAR cushion grew significantly and so what are we doing to focus on that, on the investment portfolio we\u2019re mindful of managing OCI risk given that it flows through the overall CCAR process. We continue to be very focused on moving out those loans and those assets that have higher loss content and at the same time making sure that the originations that we put on are of the highest quality. So we continue to focus on that. If you look at the overall risk that\u2019s being taken within the market\u2019s business, we\u2019re managing that, so that there\u2019s not a surprise as it relates to that. And clearly we continue to work hard to move out those exposures that have high loss content there.  So, yeah I think it\u2019s really much more but a continuation of the work that we\u2019ve been at for several years now, and we\u2019re mindful of making sure that we continue to push that stuff out at the same time that we\u2019re originating those things that will perform well as part of that overall exercise. Steven Chubak : All right, thanks Bruce that detail is extremely helpful. And then one more quick final one from me, I was hoping you can give us an update on where your T-LAC ratios sit today? Bruce R. Thompson: Yeah, I think that the T-LAC ratio, as it relates to where we are, and this assumes that we exclude stuff that\u2019s less than a year; I think that the T-LAC ratio is roughly 21% at this point. We\u2019ll have to see the deducts that come in and out of that based on G-SIB and other things but I think we\u2019re just below 21% at the end of the quarter. Steven Chubak : Okay, great. Thank you for taking my questions. Bruce R. Thompson: Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Brennan Hawken from UBS. Your line is open. Brennan Hawken : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Quick one on wealth management. Is it possible for you to quantify for us how much of your total wealth management client assets are in retirement accounts and of that what percentage are advisory? Brian T. Moynihan: We\u2019ll get back, I don\u2019t have that up off the top of my head, in terms of -- I just don\u2019t have that off the top of my head. Brennan Hawken : Okay, just the whole idea there is just trying to get at the DOL proposal and maybe what could be potential downside even based on how it all gets finalized understanding that it\u2019s preliminary at this point? Brian T. Moynihan: Yeah, [indiscernible] tell you on that. Brennan Hawken : Okay, and then looking at the branch declines that you guys referenced earlier, is the tweak on the sort of 5% year-over-year, as a reasonable decline rate sustainable from here given the trends that you\u2019re seeing in your mobile platform and could this potentially add additional GUs [ph] to your expense decline beyond the business as usual type pushing that you guys spent a lot of time talking about here in the call today. Brian T. Moynihan: So let\u2019s step back and make sure that what we understand one thing. It\u2019s the idea is they were moving because the customers are moving and how they conduct business. So you've got to run your changes consistent with what they're doing. And that's a base line that you have to stick to. If you forget that you can overshoot or undershoot frankly. And so -- and so that being said, that's one point.  Second point is in the 6,100 branches that we had at the peak down to this level, there are multiple things we are doing, customer behavior changes, change in the configuration of the market we attack, et cetera. So there are lots of elements. So now you're more in a business as usual ongoing practice, which will really be driven more by the customer behavior as opposed to some view point we have about markets and arranging the franchise. So I'd expect that they will continue to work themselves down. I wouldn't predict a steady rate because to it's a very composite [ph] equation.  But then let\u2019s split what's really going on, as Bruce talked about earlier we have 17.6 million mobile users, we have 31 million bank -- computer banking users. That number is actually growing again, for a while was kind of flattish, is actually growing. So it's interesting that that's happening. 60% of our sales are all digital now, about 6% of the sale that are digital which is computers and mobile, or mobile and that's growing at 300%. So it's catching up. And then you get things that are interesting because it grows the efficiency of branch. There are about 10,000 appointments scheduled in the mobile device a week at the branch, that allows us [ph] to have a more efficient branch structure, even though we may have less, we may have bigger branches because you have more sales going on in them. So think about that, that's up from 2,000 last year second quarter, 10,000 times a week now and growing at that rate implied there. People are scheduling appointments to come see us, which is a lot better experience for us and them to serve themselves, allows us to have our staffing levels down. Bruce referenced the check deposit are 13% of all checks. So the activity of all this is critical to that question. So I won't give you a 5% reduction or 4% reduction, or any mathematical equation we have done. But I'll be careful about assuming it will be that ratable but it would be more based on behavior change. But the key is our customers scores have gone up overall and even in mobile channels we've gone up year-over-year a 1000 basis points on our mobile channel top of the box satisfaction. So it will be a complex thing.  It's an integrated pool of capabilities, phones, online ATA at branches. And you'd expect it to be pressured going down, but remember we were early into this and if you think about 1,400 branches, that's bigger than a lot of companies out there already have a system. So we've been at this for a long time and we will do it the right way because if you push too hard to you will hurt the clients. Brennan Hawken : That's helpful, color, Brian, thanks. And then last one from me, you made reference earlier to a couple of points margin from the employee forgivable loan, amortization dropping off next year. Is that, is next year sort of a bump in the trend or is that indicative of potential further declines in forgivable loans as they continue to roll off. And does it assume some level of counter pressure offsetting pressure from continuing recruiting. And maybe a little update on the recruiting environment for us, guys will be helpful. Brian T. Moynihan: Yeah, what I'm referencing is discrete away from the entire recruiting process. This is a setup at a time where that transaction for a group of people at that time. And it just came in over the years and it's not just the last year but it goes beyond [ph]. The forgivable loan factors and all the other stuff recruiting is a little different thing. But John Keith Banks and the team, they're successful recruiting on the experience level. The attrition for the top two quintile for financial advisors is at an all-time low. I think again it\u2019s run about 2% [ph] or something like that. So we're retaining those and we are recruiting at the both, experienced level.  But importantly what is obvious to us is to drive the amount of client need here, to drive to get the client need which is huge and underserved in our beliefs. We had to create more advisors than there out there. And so we've really worked hard on the [indiscernible] and training program which is basically bring deeper business experience out there for us, to bring them into our firm and also other industries into our firm. And that is now, we think reaping benefits to us, we have been working on it two or three years, retool and drive it. So you should expect our advisor counted to go up and our productivity may come down per advisor. But frankly there is a lot of business where, remember [indiscernible] per advisors is a million in spends. And so bringing it down a little bit to get a lot more growth and a lot more growth in advisors would not be -- would be a great trade for our company. So our recruiting is strong, we're net -- doing a decent job, sort of hire and you hear a lot about.  That is not a big part of the advisor count, several hundred a year, like probably 200 to 300 but with the drive of our advisor and capabilities of our client there\u2019s a broader build out of the team switch the BFAs and T&Ds that work at the branches on cases and grow the people in there. That just were down to our benefit overtime, although it's had a little drag on profitability right now it's the best. Brennan Hawken : Great, thanks for that. Operator : Our next question is from Marty Mosby from Vining Sparks. Your line is open. Marty Mosby : Thank you. I wanted to ask about the asset liability management. When you look at the market adjustments that you had at $669 million this quarter, as rates go up there is less and less impact from that. How much is remaining in the next 50 basis points in just the prepayment speed slowing down? Bruce R. Thompson: Yeah, I don't have 50 basis points Marty, but the number we quoted was on a 100 basis point move the FAS 91 benefit would be $775 million. Marty Mosby : Okay, perfect. And then when you're talking about the -- being able to see the margin go up in the back half of the year, because of the current steepness of the yield curve, does that include some utilization in the sense of increasing your securities portfolio while you invest some of the liquid assets that you have on the balance sheet? Bruce R. Thompson: There is clearly some of that, because we would expect as we go forward with the comp position of the balance sheet that there will be incremental cash to, that's generated. Obviously some of that goes into loan growth and some of it goes into the investment portfolio. So they're embedded in that. Those comments is an assumption that there will be a little bit more to be invested. Marty Mosby : And you mean it will range $10 million, $20 million, $30 million, what's the -- any kind of rule of thumb there? Bruce R. Thompson: I would think of it as on the low end of that, during the third quarter and a comparable amount in the fourth. And there is one other thing that I did want to correct, that I said earlier that if you look at the securities balances yields, the stability that we saw once you adjust for FAS 91 was Q1 to Q2. Marty Mosby : Got you. And lastly, this is a new launch. But when you look at the trading activity, typically in the past when I had a trading activity in the bank that I was managing, when you have a steepening of the yield curve, you get some pickup as you get in the current long term yield funded by short term rates. The rate on the trading activity account did not go up this quarter but averaging into the next quarter would you expect some benefit there? Bruce R. Thompson: I think if you look at -- I think the important thing is that there is -- so that rate tends to manifest itself in the market based NII. There are lot of things that drive that, when rates move around as much as they have. But I don't think there is any question that overtime as you're in an increasing rate environment that there is a part of the yield component that flows through NII that you would expect to get a little bit better. Marty Mosby : I\u2019m just more focused on the steepness versus the flattening of the yield curve. A steeper yield curve typically brings little better spread of the trading account. Bruce R. Thompson: It would, but the question is it will -- yeah it works this way true but it is -- if you look across long periods of time it's relatively constant. Marty Mosby : Okay, thanks. Operator : Our next question is from Nancy Bush from NAB Research. Your line is open. Nancy Bush : Hi, good morning. Guys just another liquidity issue. Could you just tell us what's on deposit, what excess deposit you've got with the Fed now and what are your plans are for those going forward? Bruce R. Thompson: Okay, at any one point in time it can move around, but you should assume it\u2019s comfortably about a$100 billion excuse me, that's on the Fed in any one night during the quarter. And I think that when you look at where we are with LCR, where we are, both the parent as well as the bank, and I think in $484 billion of overall liquidity, which is a record that we feel were in a reasonable place. And I don't see significant changes going forward Nancy. Nancy Bush : Okay, you mean an overall liquidity or liquidity on deposit with Fed? Bruce R. Thompson: Probably both. Nancy Bush : Okay. That\u2019s a lot of liquidity? My second question Brian is for you. I mean you've gone through a lot of change over the past few years and this transition of mobile et cetera, et cetera but one of the things I still get from talking to people are persistent gripes about service quality, particularly in the mortgage company. Can you just tell us what your internal polling or whatever shows in terms of improvements in credit quality and how do you feel about that entire subject? Brian T. Moynihan: I think in the mortgage business that for example the funds, the bank originators we're number one in J. D. Power survey and I think we are number two or three overall mortgage company. So I think in terms of originating mortgage [indiscernible] getting steeper, Ron Sturzenegger [ph] has gotten that platform settled in and you will get momentary spikes where refi\u2019s bump up and things slowdown. From a getting it all done, from a keeping our credit quality, where we want it, that ends up with us having some noise around people we don't get mortgages. So we get the 15 [ph] that we did this quarter, 30% of its low moderate incomes so we are still serving that segment. But again we are not pushing for better terms in mortgage and I think you\u2019d understand Nancy. Nancy Bush : Yeah. But how about just more the issue of service quality at the branches et cetera? Brian T. Moynihan: Well if you look our customer scores continue to rise and -- almost on monthly basis in the broadest context of brand and part of that\u2019s due to what happens at the branch, part of it\u2019s also due to this stuff going on around the company and that's gone from the low point in fourth quarter 2009 it rose fairly steadily, so it\u2019s been back to within 95% of where it was at its highest point in 2005 and '06. So that we are satisfied. If you actually go to the customer who actually get served, when you measure all the channels, which we measure with tens of thousands of customers a week, and the month you find that those scores continue to go up and the top two box score, I think were in the 70s to 80s at the various channels and including mortgage.  So I think because we just have a lot of customers you will find out once in a while we will bump [ph] up in our jobs. But if you think about, we've added mortgage production, check-in accounts, net new, the credit cards and that\u2019s -- the ramification that we give service and driving it the team has continued to work at it. We're not perfect and while we will get better, but I think if you look at it last three or four years it\u2019s continued to get better. Nancy Bush : All right, thank you. Brian T. Moynihan: And by the way if you look at our deposit growth it continues to accelerate and over the top of CDs continued to run of year-over-year to $10 billion. So we are up $31 billion in deposits in consumer year-over-year. I think it is in CDs are probably down another $10 billion or so. So think about that, if people didn't like us a lot they wouldn't be giving us their core check-in accounts and that is happening more and more every quarter and that we will service well as rates change because we are a hugely primary focused check-in account company in the broad mass part of the business, which is different than the past. Nancy Bush : All right. Good to hear. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Mike Mayo from CLSA. Your line is open. Michael L. Mayo: Hi, I just wanted a follow up on Betsy\u2019s question, at the start talking about expenses being at a run rate or maybe going lower. The expenses are down $400 million year-over-year. But if you look at your four business lines, the revenues were down twice that, implying a lot of the rest is coming through the other lines. I guess I'm just wondering how much more there is to cut, or should cut if the expenses are down again a quarter of million. But the revenues in the core business lines down $800 million. How do you balance that trade off? Bruce R. Thompson: I think the first thing that you have to keep in mind, Mike when you quote the numbers within the business is on a year-over-year basis you have two significant things happening. You've had FAS 91 and the significant movement in rate as it relates to push out of those charges as well as, as we push the LCR out to the businesses that from a reported segment perspective that has a significant impact. And so I think as we've gone through the presentation that the numbers that I would focus on are very much what's going on within the segments, looking at the fee income lines because there is activity from a net interest income perspective of greater activity within the businesses. So I'd be a little bit careful with that characterization and I think in that context I go back to Brian's initial comments which we continue to push hard, we\u2019re adding client facing personnel across the company at the same time we are reducing aggregate headcount and that\u2019s leading to declines in the expense numbers, and we\u2019re very, very focused on continuing to keep that balance as we go forward. Michael L. Mayo: Okay. Just to understand because I am looking at your slides, slide 17 and the other slides in your presentation deck, looked at the four slides, related to GWIM, Global Banking, Global Markets, Consumer Banking, I took second quarter of 2015 versus second quarter of 2014 and looked at the delta in revenues and that\u2019s how I got the $800 million decline, so you would say which adjustment should we make from that? Brian T. Moynihan: Let\u2019s just take -- we will take GWIM because I have got that number on the top of my head, Mike. I think year-over-year the difference in GWIM NII allocation through this sort of [indiscernible] and those things is, Bruce how much\u2026? Bruce R. Thompson: Yes, let\u2019s just go through relative to the second quarter of \u201814 you have got consumer from an overall NII impact was more than $200 million, GWIM was as Brian said roughly $130 million, overall investment bank, our global banking was a couple of hundred million and then you have the minimus amounts within markets in LAS. Brian T. Moynihan: So that is nothing more than us changing the allocation method. It\u2019s because of LTR things becoming important, so we push down the business to get the behavior of the businesses aligned with the parent. So this is why you have to be a little careful about micro assessing these movements because things change and the methodology year-over-year and we don\u2019t go back and restate this, we didn\u2019t do it last year. Michael L. Mayo: Okay. I will follow up on that. So just are you comfortable, are you satisfied with the revenue progression that you have had, no matter how you take a look at it? Brian T. Moynihan: We are satisfied that we are starting to see the hard work of all our teammates come through but we are not satisfied in the sense that we expect better performance on both the revenue expense line in the future. We said that we\u2019ll keep working at it, but if you look at it over the last several quarters we\u2019ll see the stability in revenues but continued work on expenses both in the dollars but also the headcount, you have \u201815 straight quarters, 3,000 or more personnel reductions per quarter is a pretty strong record that shows that we are disciplined [in cutting costs]. Michael L. Mayo: And then a separate question, I think it\u2019s first time you have listed ROA and ROE on the first page of your press release and should we read anything into that, that you are more focused on achieving these targets with a specific time frame or kind of what changed? Brian T. Moynihan: It maybe the pagination. It\u2019s been listed, in our documents consistently Mike so... We are all focused on those goals and we\u2019ve told you that last time you asked the question. Michael L. Mayo: And then lastly, just I know I have asked this question before, is there a specific timeframe that you commit to, to achieve your ROA and ROE goals? Brian T. Moynihan: Mike as I told you, Dan and me [ph] will be there with a few other people, and asked me questions on this question, we have the building blocks in place to get us to where we are and we consider building blocks are in a place to get us to our goals and there are external factors with the rate increase and stuff that are -- you see the market curve that\u2019s changed just in the last 15 days this quarter and has moved around dramatically. So we are going ahead with our control elements we continue to drive and see the progression towards next several quarters as we told you. Bruce R. Thompson: And I think if I could -- just to be clear, we talked about a 100 basis points and 12% to 14% return on tangible common equity, obviously at 99 basis points we are bumping right up against that. And I think what\u2019s important is as you look to the past, to what we have talked we are basically there in the second quarter you can say you have the $700 million in FAS 91 the 400 of loan sale gains and a couple of hundred million from rep and warrant provision but what I think is interesting and as you look at the past Eric, if you look at and assume the 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve what that would mean in the quarter as well as if we ultimately get to where our LAS expense goals are you basically back to all other things being equal where we were this quarter.  So what was articulated is something where you couldn\u2019t see a path or a way to get there. I think it was a step forward this quarter as far as seeing how we can get there. Michael L. Mayo: All right thank you. Operator : And we will take our final question from Christopher Wheeler from Atlantic Equities. Your line is open. Christopher Wheeler : Yes, good morning gentlemen and I am sorry to raise the subject of cost again. But I just want to square away what you said I think to Betsy\u2019s question at the very beginning. So what you said at the conference back in May when you actually said that if the trading revenues didn\u2019t pick up you would have to adjust costs further. I just wondered where you were on that, because obviously trading revenues were down about 2% year-on-year, I think in the quarter and I am having to assume that the start of the quarter has been pretty bumpy with Greece and China. So could you just talk a little bit about how you see that, perhaps also talk a little bit about how you might address that situation in global markets and global banking in respect of the U.S. business and the international businesses because it is very clear that the U.S. business seems to be offering more opportunities not just because they are more buoyant but also because you\u2019re seeing European bank play a lesser role than obviously seeing three of the big banks getting new CEOs in the last few weeks. I hardly imagine they are going to be allocating more capital to investment banking? Thank you. Bruce R. Thompson: Let me take a stab at a couple of parts of that question. The first is and I think you referenced that what would you do if global market expenses were lower at a go-forward basis. I think this quarter was reflective of the way you\u2019d expect us to manage it which is the pure sales and trading number was down 2% and total expenses within the segment were down 5%. So I think some of what Brian communicated in May you saw evidence of that happening during the quarter.  The second thing that I would say is that it\u2019s obviously early in the quarter but I wouldn\u2019t draw any conclusions as to overall performance based on the volatility that we\u2019ve seen during the first couple of weeks to the negative. And then third, I think your question was and is just that with what\u2019s going on within some of the European banks as well as changes in management and questions around capital, how does that translate and what are you seeing in the U.S. business. I think I\u2019d say is that we obviously have significant share in the U.S. business. We\u2019re looking to do a better job of that and I think that as you look at some of the loan growth that we\u2019ve seen that it\u2019s reflective of the fact that we\u2019re deepening in the U.S. but just as importantly that loan growth is not only in the U.S. its\u2019 throughout Europe. There\u2019s been a little bit in Latin America and there\u2019s been growth in Asia Pac.  So we are looking to use some of these market opportunities as a basis to deepen and look to grow the overall global banking segment. Christopher Wheeler : Thanks very much, thank you. Lee McEntire : Thank you everyone. That\u2019s the last question and we look forward to talk to you next quarter. Operator : This does conclude today\u2019s program. You may now disconnect at any time.",

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later you will have the opportunity to ask questions during the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Please note this call is being recorded.  It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Mr. Lee McEntire. Please go ahead sir. Lee McEntire : Good morning. Thanks to everybody on the phone, thanks on the webcast for joining us as well. Welcome to the third quarter results. Hopefully, everybody has had a chance to review the earnings release. It is only available on the Bank of America Investor Relations website. So before I turn over the call to Brian, let me just remind you we have a new CFO that will be going through the results this morning, Mr. Paul Donofrio. And so, we will -- we may make some forward-looking statements. For further information on those, please refer to either our earnings release documents on our website or our SEC filings. So with that I will turn it over to Brian. Brian T. Moynihan: Thank you Lee, and good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us to review our third quarter results. Today, we reported $4.5 billion in after tax earnings or $0.37 per diluted share. When we think about the quarter, the key message is we continued to make good progress in a tough revenue environment due to low interest rates and a sluggish economic recovery. In addition with the late summer's volatility, especially the fixed income trading markets are remaining challenging. So with that we produced another good quarter of progress in all the businesses.  Before Paul takes you through the details of the quarter, I want to provide a little context from my vantage point. We continued to make progress towards our full earnings capacity here at Bank of America, and this quarter represents the fourth consecutive quarter of solid results following the resolution of our large legacy exposures in the third quarter of last year. When you think about it, over the last four quarters we have reported over $16 billion in after-tax income. That compares to the previous four quarters leading us to the third quarter of 2014 of about 5.2 billion, including the significant litigation cost. Returns over the last four quarters in aggregate generated an ROA of about 76 basis points and a 10% return on tangible common equity. This quarter, we were able to keep the absolute level of our balance sheet flat to the second quarter. But by doing that, we continued to replace discretionary assets with good core customer loans, and we believe that is a very good trend. We continue to build record liquidity, and we believe we are well positioned against 2017 LCR requirements.  Our capital is again at record levels, and we returned over $3 billion back to shareholders so far this year through common share repurchases and dividends. Our tangible book value per share improved this quarter to $15.50. It is the highest level in many, many years. So, I am going to spend a couple more minutes focusing on a few drivers in our business. Our teams here at Bank of America are focused on the everyday engagement with our customers, deepening relationships by growing the core things we do with them, deposits, loans, managing their risks, helping them invest their assets, all while keeping our cost down, and you can see that in our results. When you think about our deposit franchise, we grew $50 billion in deposits over the last year, on an all-organic basis. That in and of itself is a large bank. As a reminder, our consumer franchise is the largest retail bank in the United States. In our consumer banking business, as you can see, we grew revenue and earnings year-over-year despite the low interest rate environment. We have been restructuring our branch structure, selling some branches, closing some branches, and changing account structures, and with that this quarter our core consumer checking accounts continued to grow. We grew those accounts and improved the percentage of those customers who use us as a primary bank, and importantly the average balance per account continues to grow. On cards, on credit cards, we issued another 1.3 million credit cards this quarter, and active accounts continued to grow. The good news is we are doing it through the lowest cost possible through our core franchise much lower than other means of growth. When you go to the change in our financial services business for mobile and digital banking, we now have 18.4 million active mobile customers and 31 million active online customers. Digital sales this quarter were up 30% over the last year. More customers are using mobile device to deposit checks and access their accounts, and now are starting to buy products as well as book appointments. To get a sense of that, we are now booking 15,000 appointments a week off of our mobile devices.  Our Merrill Lynch teammates who work within our consumer business helped push us through a new standard of 2 million accounts this quarter. When we go to our wealth management business, this business is showing the effects of lower market valuations pressuring revenue, but actively here has reflected good long term flows, good deposit flows, and good loan growth. In addition, we continued to invest in long-term growth in this business. More advisors, better products, and better advice in building and preserving wealth for our clients, and these clients continue to use the full range of our products including banking products. As we switch to our commercial banking business, the business we call global banking, loans to commercial and corporate clients around the globe grew nicely from last quarter and the year-ago quarter. And although investment banking fees were down year-over-year, the industry fee pools appeared to be down as much or more. We maintained our leadership across many of the products.  In our global markets business, despite the challenging market conditions in the late August and September timeframe, we reported $1 billion in after-tax earnings in that business. Excluding DDA impacts, this is the best third quarter in earnings for this business we have seen in recent memory. Our net interest income in the company is benefiting from loan and deposit growth showing momentum this quarter after you exclude the impact of FAS 91. Focusing on expenses, which we have talked to you much about, we continue to hold our costs in check. Expense less litigation LAS costs remain well below the $13 billion threshold at $12.7 billion, and that was in line with our second quarter despite the additional costs of CCAR and additional investments in the business.  We are taking the benefits of our simplify and improve program, which keeps our costs flat, while we continue to invest in customer-facing client people to grow our businesses. This ability to invest in growth is key to driving our franchise forward. When you go to the risk side of the house, credit risk remains very strong, market risk remains subdued, and we get a great return on that VAR as you look at it across the competitors.  We continue to feel good about our legacy exposure risk, and LAS business continues to work itself down. So, in the context of the environment we faced, we are operating what we feel is a solid quarter, and as evidenced, the continuing progress on our strategy, our strategy of responsible growth with our customs. With that let me hand it over to Paul. Paul Donofrio : Thanks Brian, good morning everybody. Starting on slide 3, we present the summary of our income statement and returns for this quarter as well as Q2 and Q3 last year. As Brian said, we earned $4.5 billion in the quarter compared to a loss of a couple hundred million dollars last year and earnings of $5.3 billion in Q2. Earnings per share this quarter were $0.37. Let me mention a few larger items that in aggregate benefited diluted EPS this quarter by a penny. First, a negative $597 million market related NII adjustments, primarily FAS 91, cost us about $0.03. More than offsetting this was a $0.02 benefit from DVA of $313 million and a $0.02 benefit from a collective impact of three other items; gains from selling some consumer real estate loans, tax benefits from restructuring some of the non-U.S. subsidiaries, and a provision for payment protection insurance in the UK. Revenues were 20.9 billion this quarter, expenses were 13.8 billion, significantly lower than a year ago because of litigation costs and compared to Q2, expenses were flat as we managed costs well, while investing in our franchise. Return on assets was 82 basis points this quarter and return on tangible common equity was 10%.  Turning to slide 4, the balance sheet ended basically flat relative to Q2 with assets of 2.15 trillion. However, we grew deposits 12 billion from Q2 while long-term debt declined by approximately 6 billion. Liquidity rose to nearly $500 billion, a record level and the time required for funding is now three and half years. Tangible common equity of 162 billion improved because of earnings supplemented by 1.5 billion in OTI. This was partially offset by 1.3 billion in capital return to common shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.  Tangible book value increased 10% from Q3 last year, and our tangible common equity ratio grew to 7.8% as equity improvements outpaced asset growth. With regard to regulatory capital I want to start by pointing out that our transition ratios under Basel III increased with CET1 ending the quarter at 11.6%. However, I will focus my comments on Basel III fully phased in regulatory capital ratios. CET1 capital improved 4.8 billion to 153 billion driven by net income, positive OTI, and DTA utilization. This was partially offset by capital returned to shareholders.  Under the standardized approach, our CET1 ratio improved to 10.8% as risk-weighted assets decreased modestly even as loans grew. Under the standardized approaches, the CET1 ratio increased from 10.4% to 11% as RWA improved by roughly 30 billion, largely due to reductions in risk. During the quarter, we announced that we exited parallel loans, and we will begin reporting under the advanced approaches beginning in 4Q. So, we have also presented our CET1 ratio for 9/30 on a pro forma basis, which includes the addition of approximately 170 billion in RWA primarily for wholesale credit under the advanced approaches. The pro forma CET1 ratio at 9/30 was 9.7%, an increase of approximately 40 basis points from Q2 on the same pro forma basis. In terms of the supplementary leverage ratio, we estimate that as of 9/30 we continue to exceed U.S. rules applicable at the beginning of 2018 at both bank and parent.  Turning to slide 5, we grew loans and deposits both of which are key drivers to our financial performance. We reported loans on an end of period basis increased 1.2 billion from Q2. However, underneath the consolidated number there was significant activity I want to take a moment to point out. With that in mind, let\u2019s review why loans in all other and LAS are declining. First, the portion of our mortgages that we report in all other continue to run off due to pay downs. This run off is being replaced by new loans which are now reported in business segments like GWIM and consumer where they are originated.  Second, also in all other, we converted 6.2 billion of mortgages with long-term standby agreements into securities thereby improving HQLA. These types of conversions are largely complete. Third, we sold roughly 3.6 billion of other mortgages and NPLs as we continue to clean up and optimize the balance sheet. Lastly, in LAS, where we report our legacy home equity portfolio, second lien loans continue to run off. Now, if one excludes the above activities in LAS and all other, ending loans in our primary lending segments increased $19 billion or 3% from Q2.  Turning to deposits, on an ending basis, they reached 1.16 trillion this quarter, growing 50 billion or 4% over Q3 last year. We produced solid growth across the franchise. Global banking grew deposits 6% year-over-year. GWIM grew 3%, and consumer grew 7%. However, as you can see at the bottom right , if one includes CD run off, consumer deposits grew 10%. We have also included two other tables to give you a sense of the composition of our deposits.  Turning to quality on slide 6, I won't spend a lot of time here as asset quality continued to be strong and mostly consistent with Q2. Net charge offs were flat around 930 million versus adjusted Q2, Q3 provision expense of 806 million, and we released a net 126 million in reserves. Releases in consumer real estate and credit cards were partially offset by reserve builds in commercial. In commercial, we saw small increases in reserve over criticized exposure from Q2 driven by a downgrades in oil and gas that were partially offset by some improvements in the rest of the commercial portfolio. Also noteworthy, the increase in oil and gas reserve over criticized in Q3 was less than half the size of the increase from Q1 to Q2.  Turning to slide 7, net interest income on a reported FTE basis was 9.7 billion, declining 1 billion from Q2. The decline in long end rates in the quarter caused adjustments in our bond premium amortization, which resulted in a linked quarter decline in NII of 1.3 billion partially offset by good growth in NII otherwise. The Q2 adjustment increased NII by 669 million while the Q3 adjustment decreased NII by 597 million.  NII excluding these adjustments improved 292 million from Q2, to 10.3 billion. Three factors drove this increase. First, we grew core commercial loans. Second, we improved the composition of the balance sheet and our global markets business which improved trading related NII. And third, we benefited from one extra day in the quarter. With regard to asset sensitivity, at the end of the third quarter our overall asset sensitivity increased as a result of the decline in long end rates, which drove the FAS 91 adjustment. As of 9/30, an instantaneous 100 basis point parallel increase in rates is estimated to increase NII by approximately 4.5 billion over the subsequent year with a little more than half of that improvement caused by increases in short end rates.  Turning to slide 8, non-interest expense was 13.8 billion in Q3, matching the level of expense reported in Q2. The 20.1 billion expense in Q3 last year included 6 billion in litigation costs. Litigation this quarter and in Q2 was less than 250 million. Excluding litigation, expenses were 13.6 billion in the quarter, a decline of 600 million or 4% from last year and consistent with Q2 despite additional costs related to our CCAR submission. Headcount continues to trend lower, down 6% compared to Q3 last year. LAS costs, excluding litigation, were relatively stable compared to Q2. However, we still expect to lower that number to roughly 800 million in Q4 and move lower in 2016. As a reminder, in the fourth quarter, we tend to experience some seasonal increase in expenses as we close out the year.  Let\u2019s walk through the business segments starting on slide 9 with consumer banking. Consumer earned 1.8 billion, 5% greater than Q3 last year. The business segment generated strong 24% return on allocated capital. Revenue increased over last year as increases in non-interest income outpaced the decline in NII. With respect to NII compared to last year, the benefit of higher deposit levels was more than offset by the allocation of ALM activity and lower card yields [ph].  Non-interest income benefited from divestiture gains as well as higher card income driven by increased customer activity while service charges declined. Expenses declined from Q3 last year despite a 5% increase in sales specialist and higher fraud costs in advance of ruling changes regarding EMV chip implementation. Those increases were offset by savings from the continued optimization of our delivery network. The cost of operating our deposit franchise remains low at 180 basis points, and the consumer bank reported an efficiency ratio of 57%. We continue to experience shifts in consumer activity away from branches towards self-service options. Self-service trends are driven by mobile banking, online banking, and ATM usage. Mobile banking customers increased to 18.4 million and deposits via mobile devices now represent 14% of consumer deposit transactions. Mobile processing is better for us and it is better for our customers. It is one-tenth the cost relative to processing of financial centers and more convenient for customers. On slide 10, we present key drivers and trends. Average loans grew across mortgages, card, and vehicle lending. Deposits, as Brian mentioned, continued to increase particularly if one excludes the impact of CD declining. On this basis, deposits were up 10% from the year ago. Regarding brokerage assets, Merrill Lynch accounts crossed the 2 million mark and are up 2%, while asset levels are up 8% from last year even with declines in equity markets this year. Mortgage production, although up from 3Q last year, was down from 2Q as refinances declined.  In the future, mortgage banking income in the consumer segment will be lower by approximately $30 million per quarter given the Q3 sale of a small appraisal business. A similar amount of expense should reduce quarterly as well. Looking at our card activity, card issuance was strong at 1.3 million. Combined credit and debit spending volumes were up 3% from last year despite the decline in fuel prices. Average outstandings were down slightly from Q3 last year as customers paid off more of their balances. However, average balances showed modest growth over Q2.  U.S. card credit volume was strong as net charge offs declined this quarter to a decade low of 2.5% driving risk-adjusted margins higher to 9.3% excluding divestitures. Turning to service charges, they were down moderately versus Q2 last year -- Q3 last year as we continued to open higher quality accounts that carry higher balances. These higher quality accounts tend to have fewer account fees.  Turning to slide 11, global wealth and investment management produced earnings of $656 million. Results were down from Q3 last year driven by lower market values and lower [indiscernible] client activity. Compared to Q3 last year, asset management fees were up 2% but more than offset by declines in transactional revenues. The trend of lower transactional revenues continued this quarter as clients migrated from brokerage to managed relationships which was compounded by lower markets and muted new issuance. On NII, the benefits of higher loan and deposit flows was more than offset by the company's ALM activities driving NII down from Q3 last year.  Non-interest expense was modestly higher than the year ago period as litigation costs were higher and wealth advisors grew 6%. Pre-tax margin was 23%, down from a strong Q3 last year. Margins were pressured this quarter by a few factors. First, markets declined pressuring revenue across many products especially those in which we record transactional revenues. Second, operating leverage was challenged as areas of revenue where incentives are high like asset management grew while NII where incentives are much lower declined.  Moving to slide 12, despite the lower market levels, business drivers improved. Wealth advisors were up almost 1000 or 6% from Q3 last year. Long-term AUM flows were more than 4 billion, deposits increased more than 7 million, average loans were up 10% from last year, our 22nd consecutive quarter of loan growth in this segment. The last thing I would note that\u2019s not shown here is referral rates across the company remained strong. For example, our retirement solutions business continues to win in the marketplace. We have won more than 1200 retirement plans year-to-date, many of which were referred from global banking. On a year-to-date basis, this is up more than 40% from 2014.  Turning to slide 13, global banking\u2019s earnings were 1.3 billion, generating a 14% return on allocated capital. Earnings declined from Q3 last year but were up modestly versus Q2. The comparison to Q3 last year reflects higher provision expense and lower NII driven by the company\u2019s ALM activities as well as increased liquidity costs. Additionally, we saw year-over-year compression in loans spread; however, loan growth was a positive contributor to NII. Growth from Q2 reflects improved NII from loan and deposit growth. Regarding provision expense while flat to Q2, it is up 243 million from last year. We added 125 million to reserves in Q3 compared to a release of 116 million in the year ago quarter. Looking at trends on slide 14, let\u2019s first focus on fees relative to the same period last year given seasonality. Despite a lower level of IBCs this quarter, we maintained our number three global fee position and believe we increased our market share as industry fees pools declined. Investment banking fees for the company this quarter were 1.3 billion, down 5% from Q3 last year. Advisory fees were up 24%. Debt underwriting was down modestly, equity underwriting was down from Q3 last year, in line with industry volume declines. Outside of IB, our treasury fees improved from Q2 on increased activity. Looking at the balance sheet, loans on average were $310 billion up 9% year-over-year and a similar percent relative to Q2 on an annualized basis. The growth was broad across both corporate and commercial borrowers and asset quality was consistent with our overall portfolio. Importantly, the decline in spreads year-over-year flattened as the decline from Q2 was relatively small. On deposits we saw good performance with average deposits increasing by $8 billion over Q2 and we continued to optimize the portfolio improving the composition towards higher quality deposits from an overall LCR perspective. Switching to global markets on slide 15, earnings were $1 billion on revenue of $4.1 billion despite challenging markets. We generated 11% return this quarter. Earnings were up from Q3 last year which included litigation cost of roughly $600 million most of which was non-deductible for tax purposes. As you can see, we had a net DVA gain this quarter which was higher than last year. Total revenues excluding net DVA declined from Q3 last year driven by lower fixed sales and trading and to a lesser extent IBCs, offset partially by improved equity sales and trading. Non-interest expense excluding litigation improved a $102 million versus Q3 last year, up 4% improvement. Moving to trends on slide 16 and focusing on the components of our sales and trading performance. Sales and trading revenue of $3.2 billion excluding net DVA is down 4% from Q3 last year. Comparing to the same period a year ago, fixed sales and trading revenue declined 11%. Similar to the first half of this year the year-over-year comparisons reflect good activity and macro related products like rates and after tax. Conversely, market activity remained muted in credit products driving lower client activity this quarter than Q3 last year.  As a reminder, our mix remains more heavily weighted towards credit products driven by the strength of our new issues capability and market share. Equity rose 12% driven by strong performance in equity derivatives reflecting favorable market conditions. Asset levels were down modestly from Q3 last year.  Turning to legacy asset servicing on slide 17, this segment lost roughly $200 million. I want to focus on three things here; the reduction in delinquent loans, mortgage banking income, and expenses and compare each to Q2. First, the number of delinquency for mortgage loans continued to decline down 14% this quarter as the teams continued to work through solutions for customers.  Second, mortgage banking income declined by more than $400 million. This decline was driven primarily by three factors, servicing fees declined about $50 million as the units we serviced declined. Net MSR and hedge performance declined a $100 million driven by gains on MSR sales in Q2. Reps and warranty provisions swung nearly $300 million from a benefit of $204 million in Q2 to a provision of $77 million this quarter.  Lastly, I want to focus on expenses which excluding litigation were flat compared to Q2 as increased professional fees offset improved operating cost from the decline in delinquent loans. We believe we were on-track to achieve our goal of reducing expenses excluding litigation to approximately $800 million in Q4.  On slide 18, we show all other which primarily includes our ALM actions and the operations of our UK card business and other smaller activities. While other reported a $503 million pretax loss, more than offset by certain tax benefits. The pretax loss was a result of a negative NII market related adjustments and an increase in provisioning for UK credit card payment protection insurance. This was partially offset by gains from securities and loan sales.  Regarding the change in PPI liability, we increased it because of a notice of future regulatory guidance regarding treatments of claims and a case ruling.  A comment or two on taxes before we wrap up. The Company's effective tax rate for the quarter was 26%. It was lower than Q2 due to the tax benefits I mentioned earlier. I will expect the tax rate to be roughly 30% next quarter excluding unusual items and specifically the UK, the recent UK tax proposals.  In terms of 2016, I would expect it to be in the low 30s. As a reminder from last quarter's announcement we expect that the UK tax proposal announced in July will result in a one-time tax charge of approximately $300 million upon enactment from revaluing our UK DTAs.  Let me conclude our prepared comments by offering these takeaways. Although the U.S. economy is improving slowly, revenue growth remains challenging in this interest rate environment. We are focused on those things we can control and drive, these includes delivering for our clients and customers within our risk framework and driving those things we know will result in sustainable profits and returns. Our results reflect this focus. We grew both loans and deposits across our business. We delivered to our corporate institutional clients in a challenging market environment. We stayed focused on managing risk and we kept cost in check while investing in the business. We are getting better positioned each quarter for the current business environment and we remain well positioned to benefit when rates rise. With that let's open it up to Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And we can take our first question from Eric Wasserstrom from Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead. Eric Wasserstrom : Thanks, good morning. I was just wondering if you can maybe just speak a little bit about the NII outlook given the dynamics about the stable balance sheet, shifts within the balance sheet, and how we should think about both the GAAP and adjusted NIM if the interest rate environment continues to look more or less like it does today. Can you just kind of help us think through what all those dynamics mean for NII? Paul Donofrio : Sure so I am assuming some loan growth and adjusting for day count we would expect normalized NII excluding marketable adjustments to be flat to grind up and as long as rates don\u2019t decline in the future. In the fourth quarter, we think they\u2019ll wind up slightly based upon the realization of the expected forward curve and some loan growth. Eric Wasserstrom : Okay and with respect to the loan growth, is that in the context of growth in the overall balance sheet or continued stability given mix shift? Brian T. Moynihan: I think we just look at commercial loans year-over-year at 10%, last quarter up 3% so you got to annualize that out and what we\u2019re looking at is that we replaced discretionary assets with actually good core assets. So whether the balance sheet grows a little bit or not is not as critical as the assets . So it is probably driven in near-term more by mix than aggregate size growth on a GAAP basis . Eric Wasserstrom : Okay, thanks very much. Operator : And we\u2019ll take the next question from John McDonald with Bernstein. Please go ahead. John McDonald : Hi, wondering on expenses, you kept the core expenses flat to last quarter. Did you digest additional CCAR expenses and also some cost related to the proxy vote? What are the puts and takes in keeping that flat and what\u2019s your outlook on the core expenses going from here in this kind of environment? Brian T. Moynihan: Sure, so the short answer to your question but then I\u2019d like to elaborate a little bit more is yes we kept core expenses flat and we absorbed CCAR expenses and other investments in the business in the quarter. Just take a step back I think the way we would ask you to think about expenses is we are seeing good expense progress within our business importantly as we continue to invest in the future. So core expenses which everybody excludes litigation LAS are expected to remain relatively flat at probably a little less than 13 billion per quarter in a moderately improving business environment. As we invest in growth and [indiscernible] other initiatives to offset inflationary pressures.  If the business environment is close, we would have to adjust. If the business environment is better we are going to use SIM and other efforts to improve the operating leverage of this company even as incentives and other expenses increase. Paul Donofrio : One more point Brian, I would remind everybody that we did guide you that we would have increasing cost expenses in the second half of the year so we do have a little bit of that in the fourth quarter as well. Brian T. Moynihan: So John just when you think about it from a headcount perspective because that\u2019s what going to drive our 60% people cost now. For the quarter we are down by 1.5, in that we actually had an increase in client facing headcount for the quarter of 1.6. So basically we are able to achieve a reduction while we continue to invest. On top of that the risk in CCAR FTE count was up about 400 for the quarter and other business hiring especially the new kids from school were up about a thousand. So to attrition and then through other reductions we got that down in that 1.5. So if you follow that course last quarter we were down 3,000 or so and that was just 15 quarters in a row or something like that. We are down a little less this quarter which is expected to be similar pickup next quarter. So the 12.7 we did in the second quarter remember was a surprise to all of you. We called it flat this quarter which I think exceeds what our expectations were. We are laser focused on keeping it to that kind of level where we continue to invest in the thousand plus people to go generate the business growth you are starting to see. John McDonald : Okay and Paul in terms of their credit outlook do you expect to kind of bounce around here, you got charge offs in the low 900s and you did about 100 million reserve release so charge off is 900, provision is 800, is that the kind of ballpark you expect to stay in near term? Paul Donofrio : I would expect to see provision in 2016 roughly you know where it is today. John McDonald : So that\u2019s around 800 a quarter, something like that ballpark? Brian T. Moynihan: Yes, because we are going to get a little help. John, if you look at it, you still got a little excess mortgage charge offs going through. Card continues to work its way down because of this period of credit quality and the question on the commercial side is bouncing around, gets lumpy. But if you look at the reserve release we are down to 100 so think of that sort of 800 to 900 range a quarter and I think that is a way to think about it over the next several quarters. John McDonald : Okay, thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. We take our next questions from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good morning. Paul I just wanted to ask you to elaborate a little bit on the comment that you made during prepared remarks regarding the composition of the balance sheet improving and that being a benefit for trading related NII, could you just talk through what you did and is that sustainable, the benefits to NII? Brian T. Moynihan: Sure, I think the answer is we just sold, for lack of better word, sold some lower yielding assets that we used to run our business and markets and we positioned them to high yielding assets. So maybe we led a little bit of as an example, we would do a little bit less in prime brokerage and a little bit more in fixed income where some -- yields are higher. Betsy Graseck : Okay, and then on the conversion of loans to securities for HQLA , given the fact that you mentioned that is done, what kind of core loan growth are we looking for as we move forward here? Paul Donofrio : Well by core do you mean loan growth in the business segments or for the consolidated company. Betsy Graseck : Well, I guess I will take the consolidated more than anything. Paul Donofrio : Yes, so we grew in loans as a consolidated company year-over-year by 1%. It was up slightly quarter-over-quarter. I wish that we would be able to continue to grow the whole company in the sort of -- in that range. You can see faster growth in the core lending businesses. We grew that year-over-year at 9%. I am not going to stand here and tell you that we are going to do that every quarter, but we would expect to see more robust growth in our lending segments. You have to remember that in LAS, home-equity loans are still coming down and in the discretionary portfolio even though we are not going to have $6 billion -- as much as $6 billion LTSE conversions we still are going to see first mortgages run off there. Betsy Graseck : And just then lastly on this topic when you are thinking about reinvesting deposit growth, etc. in securities, where are you relative to your new investments in securities versus what the portfolio yields are, are you close to breakeven there or\u2026? Brian T. Moynihan: In terms of the running off yields, Betsy, versus the coming on yield? Betsy Graseck : Correct. Brian T. Moynihan: It is relatively stable. Betsy Graseck : Okay. Brian T. Moynihan:  Our portfolio has been priced down over the years and so it is relatively stable. Betsy Graseck : Okay. Thanks. Operator : And our next question will be from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Matthew O'Connor: Good morning. Can you give us an update on the CCAR resubmission and then also comment on some of the management changes that occurred there as you think about the 2016 process, just how you might approach it differently or similar to what you have done in the past? Paul Donofrio : Why don\u2019t I start with CCAR and then maybe Brian will speak to some management. So in terms of CCAR we submitted our resubmission on September 30 as planned. That had the involvement of the leadership of the company and the Board, significant involvement for the line of business. We tried to keep the regulators involved and up to speed every step of the way and they have until 75 days after that submission to get back to us. Brian T. Moynihan: Yes, in terms of the change, three months ago we told you that we are making the changes. Nothing has changed and Terry continues to work on the CCAR process, Terry Laughlin and Andrea has moved over as Chief Administrative Officer and been heading the process from the day that we announced it. And that transition will continue to take place over the period of time between now and the next CCAR submission in 2016. Matthew O'Connor: Okay, and then just separately in terms of the credit quality comments that you provided for the next several quarters, how are you thinking about energy as part of that? Paul Donofrio : I think we mentioned in the prepared remarks that our criticized assets were up modestly. If you sort of dive into the oil and gas segment, you will remember last quarter we increased in criticized assets about $1 billion because of oil and gas. This quarter we saw that increase decline significantly to about 40% of that level and then be offset by improvements in the rest of the portfolio. So we saw a modest increase in criticized assets. We feel pretty good right now where we are with oil and gas. As you know our clients are going through the redetermination process. Matthew O'Connor: Just a big picture question following up on that, there was a lot of concern I think among credit folks that energy default is have increased a lot and will continue to increase from here but we are not really seeing all that much pressure with either you guys or the banks. Is it -- are you guys higher in the structure, different customer base, why do you think there is kind of less pressure with you guys than we are seeing for the industry as a whole outside of banks? Brian T. Moynihan: I think the answer is yes. The hiring structure and from lot of the risk is distributed out to investors and things like that. The Company has had reserve base methodologies our hedge involved and it is more complex, I think than oil price changes. So I think as you look at it our lending portfolio is done consistent with our quality standards and had held pretty well under the significant change in oil revenue from oil price changes. Paul Donofrio : And large corporates, we are just dealing with larger companies that have a lot of different options and in middle market, as Brian said a lot of that lending secure .  If you look at our overall energy portfolio we are about 22ish and really only about 40% of that really isn\u2019t tied. Of course everything in that sector is tied in some way to oil and gas but 40% of that\u2019s not really directly tied to the price of oil and gas. So when you start just walking through the numbers and you whittle that down and then you whittle it down for the number of loans that we have where we have reserves, it gets to something I think that is manageable. Matthew O'Connor: Okay, thank you very much. Operator : And the next question will come from Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead. James Mitchell : Hey, good morning Paul just a quick question on the liability side of the balance sheet. You had highlighted that the long term debt was down $6 billion or so in the quarter. I know that long term debt cost were down about 11 basis points quarter-over-quarter. Is that sustainable in the context of TLAC, as there is just some movement underneath the hood or is it timing, just kind of help me think about where that footprint and cost go from here? Paul Donofrio : Sure, but we generally don\u2019t comment on our issuance plans. I guess the only guidance I would give you is we are going to try to have prefer that\u2019s roughly 1.5% of tier 1 capital and sub debt that\u2019s roughly 2%. And in terms of TLAC we don\u2019t know what the rules are yet. We may have to issue a little bit more debt, but based upon what we are hearing at least from the rumor perspective it looks to be quite manageable. Brian T. Moynihan: Technically, quarter-to-quarter there were some hedges that went from a deduct to a benefit -- that is the other way around the change that rate. So, I wouldn\u2019t think that the rates, the underlying rates haven\u2019t changed much is the way to think about it. There is just a hedge cost and a hedge benefit that came through that increased the spread. Paul Donofrio : Or, you were referring to the decline in the yield, sorry. James Mitchell : That\u2019s all helpful and maybe just on the loan growth side what are you seeing on the demand side, consumer has begun to pickup for you guys where are you seeing the most strength and do you think the environment still is pretty positive from a loan demand perspective in the U.S.? Brian T. Moynihan: Remember we are focused on in the consumer business on two things that we have been consistently focused on. We are making loans to our customers i.e., in connection with the whole franchise. And then secondly, we are staying in the very prime orientation so if you think about this quarter, home-equity production was $3 billionish which was kind of consistent with other quarters that have grown from $1 billion up to $3 billion across the last couple of years and have been very consistent.  As Paul said earlier mortgage has tipped down a little bit, but year-over-year they are up strong. Little bit seasonality and there is a little bit of refi going out. Our other lending business was still was strong. The direct to consumer piece of that we didn\u2019t have two three years ago. We are at half billion dollar a quarter production, so we are seeing good demand. But part of it is just capturing that inherent client share, wallet share that we have been after and you\u2019re seeing that materialize. The other key honestly in terms of nominal growth for us is the one off non-core part that has gotten small enough over the last couple of years that we\u2019ve overcome it. So the only place we still have that hold from a quarter perspective is really the home equity business. So, we resized the card business and you are seeing all the hardwork the 1.3 million cards producing some loans even though it is a huge payment rate on that. You are seeing the auto lending business close direct to consumer and then what we do with dealers and stuff. They are strong and stable and you saw the car sales numbers strong and you are seeing the consumer real estate strong from the home equity production is solid. So, when you go over to GWIN, you saw loan growth there between U.S. trust and what we call structure lending but don\u2019t think of it that way. It is lending strategy, assets, wealth assets again also in the margin lending with more stable, it was very stable. I thought [indiscernible] we haven\u2019t seen him change in our margin lending. Lot of people think, investors that lower the risk is basically been relatively stable across the last few months. James Mitchell : Okay, great. That is helpful. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Steven Chubak with Nomura. Please go ahead. Brian T. Moynihan: Hello Steven. Operator : Hello Steven, your line is open please shut the mute button. Steven Chubak : Sorry, can you hear me now. Brian T. Moynihan: Yes. Steven Chubak : My apologies for that. So, one of your competitors revealed that their efforts to mitigate some of the GSIF indicators had actually helped push them into a lower GSIF bucket and looking at the metrics that have been published as of year-end it looks like you are actually closer to the lower end of that 3% threshold and we have seen some progress in terms of reduction of level 3 assets at your end, I just wanted to see if you actually see opportunities to manage that bucket lower or somewhere closer to 2.5%? Brian T. Moynihan: We always manage the balance sheet against all the different constraints and you can see the improvement in the pro forma advanced ratio by 40 basis points this quarter closing down the gap. So, we are always looking to manage the balance sheet; I wouldn\u2019t put a lot of stake in us moving ourselves fundamentally in buckets at this point because we have been working at that the last three years to make sure that this rule came out that we have had ourselves positioned as well as we could. So we will continue to work on it but I wouldn\u2019t expect us to change. If you look about risk assets and level 3 assets and things like that and our company continued to trend down. We just worked the balance sheet. I wouldn\u2019t say that we expect to move our bucket. We could but we don\u2019t expect to. Steven Chubak : Okay, that is really helpful. Thanks Brian. And maybe just thinking into some of the GWIM guidance that Paul you had given earlier, the negative operating leverage has been fairly pronounced which you acknowledged and I did appreciate the detail based on some of the specific factors that weigh on the margin such as litigation and maybe some remixing in terms of revenue. But just wanted to get a sense as to how we should be thinking about that margin trajectory going forward assuming no elevated litigation and without any rate boost, just to get a sense as to how we should be thinking about that profitability trajectory? Brian T. Moynihan: Let me -- if you remember last quarter we talked a bit about this. There are some things that will help us which are that some of the deal stuff runs off this year relative to next year which would give us some positive help, round numbers nearly $100 million a quarter of expense. So, that\u2019s just amortization that finally runs off, so that is positive, and I think Paul cited it and you cited back examples of some non-recurring things. I think you have to be careful in the year-over-year comparisons on the margin because this business [indiscernible] big bank it\u2019s harder to do one business at 250 to $1 billion deposit franchise, big money franchise. So all dynamics that we talked about from the corporate obviously hit them also. And so they will benefit more by stability in that as we compare quarters and then hopefully they\u2019ll grow out of that as they grow loans and deposits, that\u2019s the thing.  The question then comes down to more philosophically, would you quit investing in new advisors to get a point on margin or so and in the context that business were in $600 million or $700 million after tax for us in the context needing to drive it to another level. We still believe the right trait is to continue to invest in growth and the world changed and people weren\u2019t becoming successful which they are, we could change that. And the thought is that we are adding advisors, you don\u2019t see that in other people\u2019s franchises and we are doing in connection with consumer bank which is a critical increased success factor for our advisors. In other words if we hire people in what they call BFAs that worked within a consumer franchise with our Merrill teams and we are seeing them get up to speed fast. We think that\u2019s a competitive advantage for people entering this business and we will continue to invest in that. So, if we can't see the successful pull back on that right now it is worth it for our shareholders and our customers. Steven Chubak : Okay, thanks for that detail Brian, and maybe just one more from me on the investment banking side. One of your competitors was talking about a pause in activity that they have experienced so far in 4Q. I recognize it is early days but just wanted to get a sense as to what you are seeing within the global banking and markets businesses and also if you can provide just some additional color or detail on what you are seeing in the backlogs by channel that would be really helpful too. Brian T. Moynihan: I\u2019ll let Paul hit that but in terms of the \u2013 but just want to make sure you are talking about trading or investment banking fees or both? Steven Chubak : Both? Brian T. Moynihan: Okay, Paul. Paul Donofrio : SO I guess in terms of the pipeline, the pipeline right now looks quite \u2013 if this is investment banking fees, pipeline right now looks quite strong. There is a decent amount of M&A in it, the timing of which can move around a lot. Some of the pipeline increase I guess can be attributed to transaction that were in our pipeline in the third quarter, didn\u2019t come out in the third quarter and we are now into the fourth quarter. We saw that type of activity in ECM and as markets improve we hope that pipeline activity will come out.  In terms of sales and trading we talked a little bit about that in the prepared remarks. We saw I think great activity in equity sales and trading as clients needed to rebalance risk or take advantage of opportunities. But if we are in Asia we were getting some of that [flow] [ph] and feel good about it. On the other hand we do have a strong FICC business that\u2019s tied into issuance and the new issuance market in the third quarter wasn\u2019t as strong so some of the flows just weren\u2019t there. Brian T. Moynihan: Year over year - last year\u2019s fourth quarter was pretty tough so I think [being better than that] [ph] wouldn\u2019t be great performance in sales and trading, but Tom and the team have got business pretty well positioned in terms of effectiveness. And that\u2019s why even with the slowdown in the latter part of the quarter we still made a billion bucks and you subtract out DVAs 800 million or so, and that\u2019s good performance numbers. Steven Chubak : Alright great, that\u2019s it from me. Thank you for taking my questions. Operator : And we\u2019ll go next to Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Glenn Schorr : Hi thanks, a couple of quick follow ups. Heard all your comments so no need to repeat on the feeling decent about credit quality and energy specifically. Just looking for two pieces of info if you are willing to share either a reserve as a percentage of loans for energy specifically or it may be what percentage of the criticized exposure is energy related, just get looking for more detail behind the comfort, thanks? Paul Donofrio : I don\u2019t think we have any of that perspective with us handy and not sure we can disclose that but we\u2019ll follow up with you if we do. Glenn Schorr : Okay, worth trying. In terms of what\u2019s going on in terms of the mix shift on balance sheet, added some of the discretionary assets and into the core loan growth, I think everybody will take that all day long. I am curious on if there are RWA implications that we need to think about, is that a heavier RWA mix even though we\u2019ll take it I am just curious on how that plays on the capital side? Paul Donofrio : Yes, I think that as we grow loans obviously our RWA is going to increase particularly on a standardized basis less of an increase on an advanced basis. But they are completely tied and as you said we are comfortable with that given the interaction with our clients and the opportunities that brings to increase our margins relative to other investment opportunities. Brian T. Moynihan: I think as you think about it remember that if we go look at page 5 and you look at the content of what\u2019s leading coming on especially in the consumer business and then think about running that through all kinds of models including the CCAR process and think about getting rid of $5 billion of home equity loans which are basically non performing and putting on $3 billion of good home equity loans, that dynamic is pretty favorable to the overall sort of calculation and so. It\u2019s not only within category -- it is not only category, it\u2019s also within category that we are seeing improvement in credit quality on what\u2019s coming on but especially when you run through models and things like that. Glenn Schorr : Okay, I appreciate that. One last one on you commented earlier about the strength in equities, partially driven by the good performance in the derivatives business during the quarter. I guess the question is it ebbs and flows but maybe over the last 12 months not just the last quarter, is derivatives 40%, 50% of overall equities, is that a number you want to share. Paul Donofrio : Are you talking about the percentage of equities as a function of what? Glenn Schorr : I am saying in any given period your equity markets revenues how much of that is driven via the derivatives business? Brian T. Moynihano: I don\u2019t have a number on top of my head but I think you can look at it in various pieces; we\u2019re checking it out but you can remember that it is an integrated business. It is between 30% and 40%, we just found a number, but remember it\u2019s an integrated business so you can't say grow derivatives but the cash \u2013 because the clients do all things whether it's including fixed income and equity, so we are going together, so think 30% to 40%. Glenn Schorr : Understood, alright, thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Ken Usdin with Jeffries. Please go ahead. Ken Usdin : Hi, good morning. Brian just one question follow up on the loan side. You talked about the demand and where you\u2019re seeing it but I am just wondering in terms of like the no excuses growth mentality from a supply side, where are the lending officers now in terms of like using the excess capacity to continue to grow the balance sheet, is there still room from the BofA supply side to extend that growth on top of what the economy and the marketplace is giving you broadly? Brian T. Moynihan: Yes, I think, so if you look at the different segments, if you think about on the consumer side using \u2013 it\u2019s more sales force growth and effectiveness in building that team. And then also the digital sales coming up whether it is auto, whether its credit cards are up dramatically. So think of that engine as being both people and a machine for lack of better term. But don\u2019t think of it as changing credit quality or taking any kind of more risk, so Tom and Dean that run that business for us has done a good job and so I\u2019d say the supply has been more from a delivery capacity than it is from an expanding the box or anything like that. We really kept it to where we want it and we think that holds us in good stead as you think through all the different dynamics on company.  When you go to the commercial side it is simply couple of things and a very small business which is reported in consumer we have actually seen that business stabilize and start to make its way out of runoff position and that\u2019s again more automated scored approach, we sped up approval times and done a lot of work to make ourselves more competitive, more on delivery than credit. But if you go on business banking, commercial banking, and global corporate investment banking segment, our three versions, [Indiscernible] the team they\u2019ve actually hired over a 100 people, loan officers this year. So they could add 10% to 15% growth on loan officers. Got them hired and they are working, it takes time for them to get up to speed. [Alistair] [ph] looking at our middle market business. I think there\u2019s about 60 this year something like that, 70 people delivering and running products and things behind that also is treasury services people.  So again capacity expansion in the global corp investment bank work differently. As we look at middle market I think that is scenario where we are, we used to think if we are going to take 10 let\u2019s only take 8, that\u2019s better. We are now telling our teams, we need to understand why you are not taking 10 if that\u2019s our whole limit and our capacity in a given transactions as example and they are doing that. So I think we are probably creating a little more not risk rating type of supply but just take a little bit more loans because we are twice the equity we used to be. And therefore we can absorb it and the team does a great job in credit quality there. So I\u2019d say if you look at across the board, consumer is more delivery capacity and commercial it\u2019s more both delivery capacity and then as you cite take a little more risk in terms of dollar denomination but not in terms of [Indiscernible] credit quality. Ken Usdin : Okay, got it, and then Paul one quick follow up on GWIM, just remind us how that business kind of marks itself in terms of the asset level pricing versus the transactions. It seems like there was kind of went in different directions this quarter and the result was kind of flattish on a revenue perspective. So what do we need to think about in terms of where the markets have come and where we are looking ahead in terms of assets levels versus transaction type revenue activity? Paul Donofrio : So we continue to grow AUM and that\u2019s all good. I mean we grew it a little bit slower this quarter but in a bad market environment we continue to grow AUM, we continue to grow deposits, we continue to grow loans. So I think everyone is doing their job. You are right, that when market activity is lower we tend to see less activity in the transactional side of that business. There is a lot of new issuance there, mutual funds, other products that just don't come to market. And so that sort of exacerbates things when the markets are bad. Does that answer your question? Operator : And we are going to take our next question from Nancy Bush with NAB Research. Paul Donofrio : Good morning Nancy. Nancy Bush : Good morning guys, how are you? Two questions, one there is an issue out there I think this was supposed to happen in 2018 on credit quality, it is this current expected credit loss. Can you just tell us where the argument is about that right now and whether you have been able to do any preliminary work about how that would impact you? Brian T. Moynihan: I don\u2019t think - the idea about like a loan type of reserving on the commercial - all loans is out there. It\u2019s -- the FASB is working on it, I think there has been voluminous comments, big questions about it. But when it comes out it will be basically a one-time adjustment type of thing and then it will be over with and -- and so over a course of time it should come out the same because you think about it, this as just putting it all - you put the loans on in the commercial side especially be changed. So, we\u2019ll get to that when we get to that but it hasn\u2019t been clarified what the rule is; lots of people commented on it and it would be a one-time thing and as you say somewhere out in 18 is what people currently think. Nancy Bush : Okay, secondly, another credit quality question. I mean there was a lot of speculation before the quarter that and I think this is probably based on the energy outlook that this would be the \u201cinflection point quarter\u201d and beginning to build reserves but what you are saying and what JP Morgan said yesterday was that the credit quality outlook remains pretty stable. Can you just comment on this inflection point issue and when you think we will get there? Paul Donofrio : We\u2019re still seeing reserve releases on the consumer side of the bank that is certainly starting to moderate. And consistent with loan growth we\u2019re seeing some reserve additions on the commercial side of the bank. And as I said earlier if you are looking for when those lines are going to cross we think provision as Brian and I both said is going to be roughly sort of 800 million to 900 million in 2016, that\u2019s kind of where the conversion is going to happen, some place - per quarter, that is some place in 2016. Brian T. Moynihan: Nancy remember we still have massive risk coming off in consumer that we are not - reserves are going over the commercial side and some is coming out net of that 100 plus million this quarter. We expect that to probably mitigate and then if you get loan reserve you\u2019ll build reserves at some point but I think that is still a bit out there. Nancy Bush : So sometime in 2016, probably? Brian T. Moynihan: It depends on what the loan growth is, it depends on the economic scenario. But I think it\u2019s -- we\u2019re still repositioning reserves on the consumer side that are excess, as we can see in the credit statistics. We\u2019re carrying a healthy reserve for areas that have continued to come down in terms of risk. Nancy Bush : Okay, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Paul Miller with FBR Capital Markets. Thomas LeTrent : Good morning guys, it\u2019s actually Thomas LeTrent on behalf of Paul. Most have been asked and answered but one quick question on the servicing side, the servicing income has been coming down at sort of a faster rate than the portfolio and I know you guys have sort of exited most of the sales on the portfolio side, so at what point can we sort of expect the fees to level off and is that just a function of the legacy stuff continuing to run off? Brian T. Moynihan: If you go to page 17 you can see that the rate of reduction will come down -- will slow down, but it will still come down on of the theory the units doing. Remember the other issue we have is we\u2019re holding more of the loans so that from a corporate perspective that also has an effect here comes in - in yield or not in servicing fees. So expect the fee to work its way down but it is 345 this quarter I think, 300-ish is where ought to flatten out. Thomas LeTrent : Okay, and then also on slide 17 if I may, on the 60 days delinquent how much of that is the quarterly change, how much of that is from sales there, is that mostly just run off? Paul Donofrio : Most of it is just run off. Brian T. Moynihan: We are just working it out, and so we still got a room to go to get it normalized but there is nothing big material going on in terms of sales and stuff this quarter. Thomas LeTrent : Okay, that\u2019s all, thank you. Operator : And we\u2019ll take today\u2019s last question from Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead. Michael Mayo : Hi, I had three small questions; first, you sold $3.6 billion of assets, mortgages, and NPLs, what was the gain or sale on those sales, I am sorry the gain or loss? Paul Donofrio : In total our gain on all our loan sales in the quarter 400 million. Michael Mayo : I am sorry, 400 million. Paul Donofrio : 400 million. Michael Mayo : Okay, that added a little bit, should we assume that repeats or this is kind of a one off? Brian T. Moynihan: Mike, it\u2019s in the puts and takes we put on the first slide there. Michael Mayo : Okay, that is fine. Higher rates, you are more asset sensitive now I guess 4.5 billion to 100 basis points, you are 3.9 billion last quarter. Are you intentionally -- I mean, how do you think about that, are you leaving money on the table by being so asset sensitive, do you want to be this asset sensitive, maybe give the answer in the context to the last jobs report which seems to imply rates will increase later than previously expected? Paul Donofrio : We have not changed how we manage these rates in the company. All that happened was long end rates went down from Q2 to Q3 increasing\u2026 Brian T. Moynihan: The FAS91 is really the major difference. Michael Mayo : And then lastly, Paul you are new on the job as CFO, actually Brian this is the first call when we can ask the question why did the old CFO leave and we have heard a lot of different reports to why the last CFO leave and Paul, as you are new on the job as CFO what changes might you want to make and Paul or Brian if rates don\u2019t go up for a lot longer than you expected, what is your Plan B to deal with the tougher environment? Brian T. Moynihan: So, let me answer that and I am going to let Paul talk about three months ago; Bruce has served as Chief Risk Officer and CFO for a combined six years and wanted to get back and run a business or do something different. And so we announced that and Paul became CFO. There is nothing new to add. In terms of what we do in the environment, as we have said a lot of times to earlier questions, we continue to be able to hold the core expenses flat while we make the investments pay - the increased CCAR expenses pay for the cost of repositioning the franchise, severance and everything and we will continue to work at it. If the environment changed and we didn\u2019t think we\u2019re getting returns from that, [we\u2019ll just go] [ph] for the long-term interest of our shareholders, we would reduce the investment rate. Michael Mayo : And Paul philosophy on being CFO, any changes with your predecessor? Paul Donofrio : I think it is a little early for me to have developed a plan in terms of radical change. We have -- Bruce did a tremendous job of cleaning up the balance sheet and positioning our company for growth. He -- we have got a great team that he built and I am getting to know all that and we will see how it goes. Michael Mayo : Alright, thank you. Operator : And as it appears we have no further questions, I would like to return the program to Mr. Lee McEntire for closing remarks. Lee McEntire : Thanks for joining everybody. We will talk to you next quarter. Operator : And this does conclude today's program. Thanks for your participation, you may now disconnect. Have a great day.",

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later you will have the opportunity to ask questions during the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this call may be recorded. I'll be standing by if you should need any assistance. It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Mr. Lee McEntire. Lee McEntire : Good morning. Thanks to everybody on the phone, thanks for those that are joining us on the webcast as well. Welcome to the fourth quarter earnings results presentation. Hopefully, everyone has had a chance to review the earnings that we released. It is available on the Bank of America Investor Relations website. And so before I turn over the call over to Brian and Paul, let me remind you we may make some forward-looking statements. For further information of those, please refer to either our earnings release documents on our website or our SEC filings. So with that, I will turn it over to our CEO, Brian Moynihan. Brian Moynihan : Thank you, Lee, and good morning. Thanks to all of you for joining us this morning to discuss our fourth quarter results. Before Paul Donofrio takes you through the details of the quarter, I just want to provide some overall context on our progress in 2015 and the opportunities and challenges ahead. As you know, for the fourth quarter, we reported $3.3 billion in earnings or $0.28 per diluted share. For 2015 we had net income of $15.9 billion, that's the highest net income we've had in a long time. Full year return metrics were 74 basis points for ROA and 9% for return on tangible common equity. During 2015 we continued to drive our 8 lines of business forward. We've focused on driving responsible growth across all our businesses and as you look at the annual earnings of the company and see how they fell, you can see how they came through. Our consumer and wealth management businesses serving mass market customers all the way to the wealthiest Americans delivered $9.3 billion in net income this year. Our Global Banking business which provides services to small, medium and large companies around the world, produced $5.3 billion in net income this year. Within our institutional investor clients our markets business with its market leading research capabilities and the top tier platform across the globe delivered $3 billion in earnings after adjusting for DVA in a very challenging market. What's clear in these earnings despite the gyrations of markets especially at the end of the year last year is annuity nature that we get from our franchise by driving customer and client flows. That's the power of our company, it\u2019s balancing the scope and a strong customer base and we aim to continue to improve it every day for our clients and customers and our shareholders. These results reflect the work we've done over the past several years to develop a more straightforward and simplified operating model and focus on responsible growth. As you see on slide 2, across the variety of measures, loan growth business activity, capital liquidity, credit losses and cost management, we've made meaningful progress and believe we are positioned for a variety of economic cycles. At the foundation of all this is a strong capital and liquidity base. We added to our record liquidity levels in 2015 and we believe we are well positioned against the 2017 LCR requirements with total global excess liquidity sources now at over $500 billion. This amount represents nearly a quarter of our balance sheet and we now have enough [indiscernible] liquidity to last more than three years before we need to tap the market for funding. Now our liquidity levels were driven by strong growth in deposits this year and we were able to put that funding to work to grow loans on an absolute basis for the first time in several years. Loan growth was all driven by organic activity and is consistent with our risk posture. Our tangible common equity of $162 billion is at record levels as well. We returned $4.5 billion to shareholders this year in common dividends and share repurchases. Our tangible book value per share improved 8% in the past 12 months to a new high of $15.62. Our responsible lending focus also shows in our underwriting results. Our net charge-offs were down just $4.3 billion this year, consistent with 2014 but much lower than previous years. Commercial charge-offs increased off a very low base mostly from oil related charge-offs while consumer losses as a core continued to improve. This reflects further responsible underwriting as continued improvement in our legacy portfolios. And finally we get to the cost management side. At the heart of our work has been improving expenses which you can see are down sequentially from last year mostly on lower litigation costs, but also on improved LAS and other operating costs and these have improved steadily across the last several years. We began new a BAC in 2011 and completed it in 2014. Since then we have been using our Simplify and Improve initiatives to find savings that more than offset increased compliance, merit and other inflationary costs. But most importantly those savings fund investments in our business whether it is in technology or sales force growth or other infrastructure costs. As we move to slide 3, we included a few examples of trends, business activity in our consumer side of the house and wealth management side of the house. As you can see, we grew average deposits in consumer banking and wealth management business is $52 billion or 7% comparing year-over-year fourth quarter periods. These deposits were up over $105 billion in core deposits at the end of 2012. This strong organic growth is the result of hard work in improving the customer satisfaction in our franchise by making it easier for customers to do business with [indiscernible] and strong product management simplifying the product set. All this has been done, where we've optimized our delivery networks, reducing our financial standards, divesting certain markets and also expanding our award winning mobile capabilities in the customer base that uses that. As you can see this work also extends to our wealth management business. We had long-term net flows every quarter for six and a half years in wealth management. We have record loan levels and significant higher deposit levels, good products and [advisers] [ph], a growing sales force and two of the leading brands in business positions us well here.. Let me move to our global banking markets area. You can see on the institutional side of the [house] [ph] that\u2019s set out forth on slide 4, we saw solid activity in 2015. Loans to commercial and corporate clients around the globe are growing nicely. Client demand has been good and our bankers have met our challenge to capture market share responsibly. This focus allows us to demonstrate a strong 12% growth in loans through global banking in the past 12 months and you can see the deposit growth has been strong here in the last year as well. If you look at the markets business Tom Montag and team have done a good job of reducing assets and lowered the risk and still are generating relatively stable revenues. Despite the recent market challenges we remained quite profitable in this business and well positioned around the globe with both a strong [FICC] [ph] and equity platform. As we step back we remain focused on our core customer strategy. We will continue to invest in the future and even as we continue to address the legacy issues of the past. We've been able to grow even as operating and economic environment remains in a low growth mode. Our model is solid but there is still plenty of work to do, but also there is plenty of opportunity ahead for us. Overall I am pleased with the progress made in 2015 and we have more to do in 2016. In 2016 you should expect us to continue to focus on responsible growth. We will continue to drive the investments made in our franchise to deliver the value to you the shareholders. We will continue our sharp focus on risk management and we will continue our cost discipline as we look to continue to improve return on capital \u2013 capital metrics of our company. With that, let me hand it over to Paul. Paul Donofrio : Thank you, Brian, and good morning everyone. Starting on slide 5, we present a summary of the income statement and returns for this quarter as well as the fourth quarter of last year which had similar seasonal aspects. We earned $3.3 billion in the quarter compared to earnings of $3.1 billion in 4Q 2014. Earnings per diluted share this quarter were $0.28, up 12% versus a year ago. The results include two significant charges that were previously announced and impacted EPS by $0.06. First, we recorded a pretax charge of $612 million associated with trust preferred securities which phased out of tier two capital at the end of 2015. Second we had a tax charge of $290 million associated with the UK tax changes that were enacted during the quarter. Lastly we had a few other items that benefited the EPS this quarter by a penny on a net basis. These included a negative net DVA impact in sales and trading that was more than offset by positive impacts of market related adjustments in net interest income and some one-off tax benefits. Revenue on an FTE basis was $19.8 billion this quarter up 4% from Q4 2014. Expenses were $13.9 billion approximately $300 million or 2% lower than a year ago driven by good expense discipline across the company. We also provide returns and a few other metrics on this page, I would remind you that client activity and revenue in our global market segment tend to be lower or lowest in the fourth quarter affecting returns on other statistics. Lastly, as many of you are aware, there was a recent accounting change that required certain unrealized debit valuation adjustments to be recorded directly to OCI rather than through the P&L. We early adopted this change effective as of the beginning of 2015. The slide and the supplemental earnings material that was in 2015 results have been adjusted. Turning to slide 6 and focusing on the balance sheet, we grew deposits by $35 billion from Q3 and we used these increased deposits to fund responsible loan growth. In total assets climbed $9 million as increases in loans and security balances of $30 billion were more than offset by reductions in trading related assets and cash. Liquidity rose to just over $500 billion, a record level, and time to required funding remains over three years. Tangible common equity of $152 billion improved modestly in Q3 as earnings were offset by both the return of $1.3 billion in capital to common shareholders and negative OCI driven by security values. Tangible book value per share increased to $15.62, another new record high. Turning to regulatory metrics we began recording regulatory capital under the advanced approaches for the first time this quarter, and the CET1 transition ratio under Basel 3 ended the quarter at 10.2 and really has no comparable metrics as transition ratios in prior periods were reported under the standardized approach with lower RWA levels. On a fully phased-in basis, CET1 capital improved modestly to $154.1 billion under the advanced approaches compared to Q3 2015 pro forma estimates the CET1 ratio increased slightly to 9.8%. RWA was essentially flat as growth from commercial exposures was mostly offset by lower activity and balance sheet levels in our global markets segment. We also provide our capital metrics under the standardized approach. Here our CET1 ratio was flat at 10.8% with modest improvements in capital offset by modest increase in RWA. In terms of the supplementary leverage ratios we estimate that as of 12/31 we continue to exceed U.S. rules applicable beginning in 2018 at both the parent and bank. Turning to slide 7, we had strong loan and deposit growth this quarter. Reported loans on an end of period basis increased $15 billion from Q3. This is the third consecutive quarter of recorded increases in total loan balances. We continue to see solid loan demand in our primary lending businesses partially offset by runoff in LAS and all other. Excluding declines in LAS and all other, ending loans in our primary lending segments increased $22 billion from Q3. $8 billion of this increase was in consumer loans as GWIM increased mortgages and security based lending. Consumer banking also saw good loan growth in mortgages as well as vehicle loans. We also had some seasonal growth in credit card partially offset by selling $1.7 billion of card receivables at the end of the quarter. Commercial loans grew $15 billion spread across multiple industry groups. Turning to deposits, on many basis they reached nearly $1.2 trillion this quarter growing $78 billion or 7% in Q4 2014. Growth was solid across the franchise. Consumer led the way growing 9% year-over-year while global banking and GWIM each grew at 6% pace. Turning to asset quality on slide 8, while still strong we did see net charge-offs increase modestly from recent levels. Total net charge-offs increased $212 million versus Q3, $144 million was from consumer items previously reserved for and lower recoveries on the sale of NPL in the fourth quarter versus Q3. We also saw a $73 million increase in net charge-offs from our energy portfolio. Outside of these two areas, net charge-offs were stable compared to Q3. Provision of $110 million in Q4 was relatively flat with Q3. Reserve releases in consumer real estate and credit card were partially offset by reserve builds in commercial which was driven by increase in criticized exposures as well as loan growth. Reserve releases excluding the previously reserved items I mentioned earlier were roughly $200 million. On slide 9 we provide credit quality data on our consumer portfolio. Net charge-offs increased $137 million. The two items of note that make up this increase were reserved for in prior periods and did not impact the provision expense in the quarter. $119 million was the result of collateral valuation adjustments. In addition, we had some small charge-offs associated with our 2014 DOJ settlement. We expect to complete our commitments under this settlement in the first half of 2016. Adjusting for these two items, consumer net charge-offs were relatively flat versus Q3. Delinquency levels and NPLs continue to decline and reserve coverage remained strong. Moving to our commercial side, on slide 10, net charge-offs increased $75 million primarily from losses in our energy portfolio. Outside of the energy portfolio, commercial losses remained very low. Given the focus on the impacts of low oil prices on companies in the energy sector, we want to spend a minute to describe our energy portfolio and provide some perspectives. The pie chart break down our $21 billion utilized exposure to the energy sector. This represents a little more than 2% of our total loan balances. Within that $21 billion $8.3 billion or less than 1% of the total loans is loans to borrowers in two subsectors, Exploration and Production as well as Oil Field Services. We consider these two subsectors to have significantly higher risk than the rest of the energy portfolio. Of our $8.3 billion utilized exposure to these two higher risk subsectors $2.9 billion has already been downgraded to criticized. So 35% of the higher risk subsectors has already been downgraded to reservable criticized exposure thereby driving a portion of the reserves. And allowances for loan losses for the entire energy portfolio is approximately $500 million or 6% of the funded exposure of these two subsectors. The company in the vertically integrated subsector represents $5.8 billion of the energy portfolio. We believe this subsector has a better ability to withstand lower oil prices. Nearly 100% of the companies have a market capital of $10 billion or more or they are sovereign owned and the average company has a market cap greater than $60 billion. We believe the remaining exposure in Refining and Marketing as well as other is also less dependent on oil prices. As part of our standard risk management process, we stress test our credit portfolios including our energy portfolio. Our stress analysis of the energy portfolio includes various sustained low oil prices over extended periods. As an example, if we held oil prices at $30 per barrel for nine quarters we estimate our potential losses on the energy portfolio would be roughly $700 million. In energy and across our commercial sector, we continue to support clients while managing lending limits and actively engaging with stressed borrowers. Before moving from asset quality I want to refocus on total provision expense and how one should think about it over the next couple of quarters. As we continue to assess and react to future changes in the energy sector we could see lumpiness that could potentially drive provision expense over $900 million. Turning to net interest income on slide 11, on an FTE basis NII was $10 billion increasing roughly $300 million from Q3. NII included a negative $612 million charge associated with three trust preferred securities. These securities were scheduled to be completely phased out of tier 2 capital as of January 01, and with 7% to 8% coupons became expensive debt. NII also included a $150 million of positive market related adjustments to the amortization of bond premiums under FAS 91. NII excluding market related adjustments and the charge on the trust preferred improved $188 million from Q3 to $10.5 billion. This improvement was driven by increased deposit balances which we used to fund growth in loans and securities. As we move into the first quarter, please note the following : first, we will have one less day of interest. Second, recent changes by Congress will lower the amount of dividends we receive from the FRB by approximately $50 million a quarter. Having said that, if the forward curve is realized and if we have some modest deposit and loan growth we still expect to show some growth in NII in Q1 2016 relative to our adjusted NII of $10.5 billion. With regards to asset sensitivity, at the end of the fourth quarter our overall asset sensitivity decreased slightly as a result of increases in long-end rates as well as security balances. As of 12/31 an instantaneous 100 basis points parallel increase in rates is estimated to increase NII by approximately $4.3 billion over the subsequent year. Although more than half of that improvement comes from the increases in short-end rates and a little less than one quarter of the benefit comes from market related adjustments. Turning to expenses on slide 12, non-interest expense was $13.9 billion in Q4, $300 million lower than Q4 2014. This was driven by good expense discipline across the company. Litigation expense was a little higher this quarter at $428 million exhibiting some lumpiness as we work to resolve legacy issues. Keep in mind that annual litigation expense decreased from $16.4 billion in 2014 to $1.2 billion in 2015. Legacy asset servicing cost excluding litigation finished Q4 a little better than our targets of $800 million. As we have said, our net goal is $500 million per quarter. Expenses excluding litigation and LAS were $12.6 billion and represents the fifth quarter out of the past six below $12.8 billion. We continue to look for ways to streamline and simplify how we do business. This is important because it allows us to invest in growth while maintaining relatively flat core expenses and a sluggish revenue environment. And importantly this relevant flatness continued even as we invested in additional sales professionals and improved technologies. Looking towards expenses in 2016 let me remind you, in the first quarter we will record as normal approximately $1 billion in cost for retirement eligible incentives. In addition, the first quarter strictly includes seasonably higher payroll taxes of roughly $300 million. And if we experience traditional rebound in Q1 sales and trading revenue, this would also increase incentives and other associated costs. Turning to the business segments and starting with consumer banking on slide 13, consumer earned $1.8 billion, 9% greater than Q4 last year. These results reflect good operating leverage on increased customer activities. The segment generated a strong 25% return on allocated capital. Revenue of $7.8 billion was up modestly from Q4 2014. Net interest income benefited from higher deposit and loan levels. Noninterest income was down slightly from lower mortgage banking. The decline in mortgage revenue reflects selling fewer nonperforming loans as we hold more on our balance sheet. In addition there was absence of $30 million in quarterly from the Q3 sale of the small noncore appraisal business. Expenses declined 2% from Q4 2014 as the savings from reduction in financial centers and personnel more than offset higher product costs and investment in increased sales specialists. The cost of operating deposit franchise remains low at 177 basis points. Operating leverage drove improvements in the efficiency ratio of 56% as we continue to experience shifts in customer activity away from branches towards self-serve options. Mobile banking users increased to 18.7 million which is up 13% from Q4 2014 and deposit transactions from these devices now represent 15% of deposit transactions. Slide 14 presents consumer progress across a number of customer activities. I will highlight activities in three areas, loans, deposits and brokerage assets where we continue to grow responsibly. These three products are at the core of our rewards programs where we share benefits with customers who deepen relationships with us. Average loans grew $12 billion from Q4 2014 in mortgages and vehicle lending. And in deposit growth was strong at $48 billion or 9% from Q4 while the rate paid declined to 4 basis points. Regarding brokerage assets, Merrill Edge assets levels of $123 billion are up 8% from last year even with declines in equity markets this year. Total mortgage production was up 13% from Q4 last year and stable with Q3. Looking at card activity which includes GWIM, card issuance was strong at $1.3 million. Average U.S. card balances of $89 billion were down modestly from last year, but up seasonally from Q3 2015. U.S. card credit quality was strong as net charge-offs remained at decades low levels of 2.5% with risk adjusted margin of 9.4%. Credit spending volumes finished on a high note as Q4 spending was 5% higher than last year outpacing what we believe to be total market spend levels. Debit spending was strong as well. For example, on Christmas Eve day we saw record debit credit spending of more than $1 billion. In our consumer segment we expect technology adoption by customers to continue to be a cornerstone of not only improved customer satisfaction, but also efficiency gains and operating leverage. The latest examples of this are around digital selling and appointment setting. Digital sales in the fourth quarter were up more than 31% from last year. Digital appointments reached more than 16,000 recently. We expect these adoption trends to play an increasing role in future performance in customer satisfaction as we continue to advance online and mobile capabilities. Turning to slide 15, global wealth and investment management produced earnings of $614 million. Results were down from Q4 last year driven by lower transactional revenue and the impact of the market decline on asset management fees. Transactional revenue continues to be impacted by the shifting of activity from brokerage to managed relationships as well as market uncertainty. NII benefited from solid loan growth and solid deposit growth but was offset by the company\u2019s ALM activities leaving NII relatively flat with Q4, 2014. Non-interest expense was modestly higher than the year ago period. Investment in client facing professionals continues while lower revenue caused a decline in incentive compensations that was more than offset by amortization of stock awards issued in prior periods. Pretax margin was 21% down from Q4, 2014. Beginning in the first quarter of 2016 we will benefit from lower expense resulting from the completion of amortizations related to advisor retention awards given at the time of the Merrill Lynch merger. Moving to slide 16, despite the volatility and market levels we continued to see solid client activity and we continued to invest in the business growing wealth advisors 5% from Q4 last year. Long-term AUM flows were $7 billion and remained positive for the 26th consecutive quarter. Deposit flows were strong, growing end of period balances $15 billion from Q3. By the way, this may have been driven in part by client concerns of market volatility. Loans continued to grow improving 10% from last year. This is the 23rd consecutive quarter of average loan growth in this segment. Turning to slide 17, global banking earned $1.4 billion down 9% from Q4, 2014 but still generating a 16% return on allocated capital. The earnings decline from Q4 was driven by higher provision expense. Provision expense was up $264 million from Q4 last year driven by higher energy related charge-offs and reserve build to loan growth and energy related risks. Revenue increased modestly from Q4, 2014 while expense declined modestly. Driven by higher loan balances NII improved despite spread compression and the allocation of the company\u2019s ALM activities including higher liquidity costs. Non-interest income benefited from higher treasury services revenue, higher leasing revenue and a small gain from the sale of its foreclosed property, partially offset by lower IB fees. Looking at trends on slide 18 and comparing to Q4, 2014, IB fees of $1.3 billion were down 17% as leverage finance and equity issuance was partially offset by advisory fees that were at second highest level since the Merrill merger. From a market share perspective we maintained our number three global fee ranking. Looking at the balance sheet loans on average were $320 billion up 12% year-over-year. The growth was broad based across C&I, real estate and leasing. We continued to experience some spread compression although it has moderated relative to a year ago. Asset quality of new loans was consistent with the overall portfolio. On deposits we saw good performance with average deposits increasing by $16 billion or 5% over Q4, 2014. The mix of these deposits remained very good with less than 5% classified as 100% runoff of balances. Switching to global markets on slide 19 and comparing to Q4 last year, we are pleased with the results here given challenging market conditions as the teams increased revenue while using lower asset levels and less VAR. Global markets earned approximately $200 million but we think one should consider results excluding DVA. On that basis adjusted earnings were $308 million which was relatively flat to Q4, 2014 on a similarly adjusted basis. Note that our net DVA loss this quarter was $198 million and compared to a loss of $626 million in Q4 2014 which included an initial FVA adjustment. Total revenue excluding DVA improved $330 million or 10% from the fourth quarter last year on improved FICC sales and trading. Outside of sales and trading global market's share of lower investment banking fees was offset by a gain on the sale of an equity investment. Non-interest expenses increased 9% in line with revenue improvement. Moving to trends on the next slide and focusing on the components of our sales and trading performance, sales and trading revenue are up $2.6 billion excluding net DVA was up 11.5% in Q4 of 2014. Compared to Q4 last year FICC sales and trading of $1.8 billion improved 20% reflecting improvements across most products notably in rates and credit related products. Equity trading of $822 million declined 3% reflecting lower client activity. Average trading related asset levels were down 9% in Q4 2014 while VAR was down 14%. Turning to legacy assets and servicing on slide 21, this segment lost roughly $350 million in line with the prior year. Focused areas here are mortgage banking income, the number of delinquent loans and expenses all compared to Q4 2014. First, mortgage banking income which improved slightly was driven by three factors, revenue warranty provisioning improved $237 million to provision of $9 million this quarter. That favorability was offset by a decline in servicing fees of $108 million as the units service declined as well as a decline in net MSR hedge performance of $152 million. Next the number of first mortgage loans that we serviced that are 60 day delinquent continued to decline and are now at 103,000 units. And last, the team did an excellent job lowering expenses. Excluding litigation we achieved our goal of $800 million moving costs down $309 million or 28%. On slide 22, we show all other which reported a loss of $289 million. This was an improvement of $86 million from Q4 2014. This loss was driven by $612 million pretax charge associated with our trust preferred as well as the impact on the UK tax law changes. This was partially offset by gains on debt security sales as well as reserved leases on consumer real estate loans booked in all other. [Audit Start]A comment or two on taxes before wrapping up. The Company\u2019s effective tax rate for the quarter excluding the UK tax charge was 25% reflecting reoccurring tax benefits plus a few small one-off benefits. We would expect the tax rate to be in the low 30s for 2016 excluding unusual items. Before closing, I want to cover our early adoption of DVA accounting in more detail. In January of this year the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued an update to allow early adoption of a new rule regarding recognition of DVA on financial liabilities from changes in our own credit spreads. The update means that these types of debit valuation adjustments will now flow through OCI instead of the income statement. We believe this change makes our earnings comparison more meaningful and easier to understand, therefore we adopted early. We restated all periods this year per FASB rules and those numbers are contained in the supplemental package. This had no impact on capital as it moved on between retained earnings in the OCI but it did impact revenue, earnings, taxes and EPS in the first three quarters of 2015. The changes reduced previously reported EPS by approximately $0.02 each in Q1, Q2 and Q3. This accounting standard adoption did not impact DVA on derivatives which continued to flow through trading account profits . Okay let me conclude by offering a few takeaways. Although the U.S. economy is improving slowly, revenue growth remains challenging. This quarter we continued our progress on those things we can control and drive. These include delivering for clients and customers within our risk framework and driving client and customer activity that will result in sustainable profits and returns. Our results reflect this focus. We maintained a strong foundation of capital and liquidity. We grew loans, deposits and investment flows. We continue to invest in our franchise by adding sales professionals and improved technology. Our strength, global capability and experience allowed us to deliver for clients in a challenging market environment and we did all of this while closely managing expenses. With that, we\u2019ll open it up for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take our first question from Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Matt O'Connor: Good morning. Paul Donofrio : Good morning, Matt. Matt O'Connor: Can you talk about the outlook for the core cost beyond some of the lumpy items in 1Q and then specifically maybe comment on how you feel like your markets business is sized? We have obviously seen some cost savings announcements that your U.S. and non-U.S. peers and want to get sense of how you feel you\u2019re positioned for the markets? Paul Donofrio : This quarter the fourth quarter I think represents as I said in the comments, the fifth out of six that we have been below $12.8 billion. As you know, I think we\u2019ve been talking about maintaining core expenses below $13 million. So we feel really good about our progress. And to remind everybody that we are maintaining those core expenses at those levels while we\u2019re investing in front office professionals, while we\u2019re investing in technology, while we\u2019re absorbing the natural increase in pay for employees and fraud cost and CCAR costs and other things. So I think we feel good about the work we\u2019re doing there. In terms of global markets, what was the question? Matt O'Connor: Just in terms of the staffing and the positioning there, how you feel for, I don\u2019t know about the current environment, but just not bouncing back in a big, big way and obviously we\u2019re seeing reductions being announced at some of your U.S. and non U.S. peers. So how are you thinking about the sizing of your business for the environment you expect? Brian Moynihan : Matt, in the fourth quarter we did reduce headcount in the business, the markets businesses and the related capital markets business, we didn\u2019t make big announcements, but that led to the $130 million in severance in the fourth quarter numbers you see. So it will continue to adjust that headcount. Tom and his team will continue to adjust, as they made an adjustment headcount for the quarter just did not make quite the press other people\u2019s did. Paul Donofrio : The other thing I will add Matt is my focus is on core expenses. We\u2019re still \u2013 we\u2019re going to see core expenses I think continue to come down as we work on LAS and continue to hopefully see some moderation in legal expenses. Matt O'Connor: And just on the timing of the LAS getting to that below $500 million, you did disclose a big drop in the headcount if we look year-over-year and obviously there is a delay in terms of the cost in sales coming down, but what\u2019s the timing of getting to that $500 million or below? Paul Donofrio : Okay. I think we've made great progress in terms of getting expenses down I think we started at what $3.1 billion quarters ago, but we've made great progress getting down to $800 million. We are \u2013 our next milestone is $500 million per quarter. That\u2019s going to be a little bit harder, as you get lower and lower it will be more unpredictable and so we\u2019re not really giving up a target at this time, but we\u2019re going to get there as soon as we can. Matt O'Connor: Thank you. Brian Moynihan : You should expect us to make good progress, Matt, towards this year and so as you look towards the end of the year we should be getting there. Matt O'Connor: Okay. Thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll move next to Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Hi good morning. Brian Moynihan : Good morning, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : I just wanted to dig in on a couple of things, one was on energy since it\u2019s flavor of the day, you gave a lot of color there and you indicated that those $30 holds for nine quarters that is a loss of $700 million. I just wanted to understand is that already reserved for or is that over and above \u2013 case if we go below $30 what you've got baked in? Because I don\u2019t it\u2019s linear, I was just wanting to understand how you are thinking about it? Brian Moynihan : Sure, look as we said in comments we have got reserves against that energy portfolio of $500 million, that is 6% of the high risk subsectors and we developed reserves on incurred basis, we developed them by looking at loss give default, probability of default, exposure to default. We go loan by loan we have lot of imprecision, other factors if you look at imprecision, we put judgement on all of that. One of the things we look at when we come up with our judgment of what we should be is our stress testing and so that\u2019s how that gets factored in, to our reserve which again has to be on an incurred basis. Betsy Graseck : Right, so when you indicated that if $30 holds for nine quarters your models suggests a loss of $700 million that\u2019s already reserved for or is that on top of what you already have reserved? Brian Moynihan : In part that because the idea is it can only incur what you see through today in terms of the operating structure these companies and asset based on lending, these are asset based loans, these are based loans. [Audio Gap] if you are nine quarters from now and oil is still at that price you\u2019d have to have a reserve for what\u2019s left of the portfolio of the exposures been coming down, it will come down during those nine quarters, by losses you took at least in resolving this credit. So it's in part covered, but not fully because that\u2019s an estimate of our future that we as Paul said it\u2019s an incurred view of the portfolio. Paul Donofrio : \u2026 we got $500 million reserve, as we go theoretically goes to the nine quarters if that $700 million would come true of our model is perfect, it would go against that $500 million to be building reserves as you went through that process. So if you told me what you want at the end of nine quarters, that if you want to end at $500 million you can do the math if you want it to end up that more or less it's going to be more or less in terms of you kind of built. Betsy Graseck : And then could you talk a little bit about the reserve release that\u2019s still possible from the other portfolios, you have $200 million reserve release this past quarter, just wondering what the lags are on that, we've seen other institutions, they essentially finish up the reserve release? I know you had a big legacy book so maybe there is a little more lags there, I just wanted to understand how you\u2019re thinking about the trajectory there? Paul Donofrio : I think you got it, I think we have a legacy we have a large legacy portfolio on the consumer side as we continued to work through that. And if home prices continue to stay where they are and improve the economy stays we\u2019re already improved. I think you are going to continue to see reserve from us in 2016, our reserve releases as I should say from us in 2016, but they are going to moderate from what they have been in the past. Betsy Graseck : Okay, so there is still some lags, but at decelerating pace ? Paul Donofrio : Yes, that some of that swings over to the commercial book, yes as we saw this quarter, Betsy. So we have come down from a lot of reserve releases last year, $800 million or so in the fourth quarter last year $7 million or $8 million or so in the fourth quarter last year certainly is heardings down to the two couple hundred million is expect that to kind of mitigate during the course of 2016. Brian Moynihan : Yes and we've built reserves in the commercial. Betsy Graseck : All right. Thanks. Operator : We\u2019ll move next to John McDonald of Bernstein. Your line is open. John McDonald : Hi, good morning. Paul I was recalling I think you had for a goal as you had to generate positive operating leverage. I was wondering how you feel about the ability to achieve that, what kind of revenue environment are you planning for and how will you managed expenses try to get some positive operating leverage this year? Paul Donofrio : I think we feel good about the operating leverage we achieved in 2015. You can see that with the revenue growth relative to the EPS growth and I think we are looking to continue that trend. We have a little bit of a tailwind here on rates we're going to continue to manage expenses carefully. So in terms of our EPS in 2016 we don\u2019t give estimates, but in terms of EPS growth in 2016 I think it will be more of the same revenue growth with some hopefully expense discipline that will get us a some operating leverage. John McDonald : Okay and Brian, could you talk a little bit about what your goals will be with your 2016 CCAR submission are you looking to make some progress on both the dividend and buyback potentially and do you may be can share some thoughts about that? Brian Moynihan : John, we have not seen a scenario as yet and stuff like that, so I think it is probably premature to discuss that. Our goal is long term is to return more and more capital to shareholders through dividend and stock buybacks, at this price obviously stock buybacks are favored, but when we see the scenario and play that out it would be getting ahead of the process and talk about today. John McDonald : Okay and Paul one quick follow up on the NII, is there a benefit from the paid down of trust preferred that you will get in 2016 is that why you\u2019re able to grow the core and NII bit in 2016? Brian Moynihan : I won't say don\u2019t say that\u2019s why, but honestly there is a benefit from paying off those trust preferred they had I think with the $175 million in quarter and so there is a benefit there. But the way I would think about those is we\u2019re not going to \u201creplace them\u201d because they don\u2019t count toward our regulatory capital, so why would we replace them? We're going to have a capital structure that meets our regulatory requirements which requires a certain amount CET1. We are going to have the appropriate amount off preferred and something that\u2019s and - of course we have to meet \u2013 so that\u2019s how I would think about it. John McDonald : Okay and so it's really just the loan growth and pretty stable rates driving some core NII growth? Brian Moynihan : John, if you look at it \u2013 what was affecting us '13, '14 was we've continued to run our portfolios that yield to them. And obviously the reinvestment rates on the investment side of the house as we ran those off were flattish. That is kind of all run through the system, so now what we\u2019re seeing is $80 billion of a period deposit growth from fourth quarter last year and this year and the overall pay rate for that is in the low single digit basis points all for, all the consumer wealth management and driven by middle market and the banking business. So that is the deposit funding side. And the asset build is now good core loans that have reasonable yields to them and you start to see it and then pick up just a hair from that. And we expect it to drive in our core as long as the economy continues to grow a couple of percent. John McDonald : Okay, thank you. Paul Donofrio : Hey, John just real quick, I want to correct one thing I said, the 175 is full year. John McDonald : Okay. Operator : We\u2019ll move next to Paul Miller of FBR and Company. Your line is open. Paul Miller : Yes, thank you very much, on your NPAs, you have really good disclosure , you are getting it down to 103,000, did you sell any this quarter or is that all workouts through your servicing? Brian Moynihan : We thought a little bit, but not as much as we had in the past, that not as much as we had in the past. Paul Donofrio : It is very incremental at this point on the sales side. Paul Miller : And then when do you, I mean like, at this point when do you think you can get that down to I guess this is not a normal level because you've just got to run this whole portfolio off. I mean could you have any idea when that will be over with? Brian Moynihan : Well, Paul definitely three is the total portfolio. So there is a normal piece in that and an abnormal piece of that that we should be driving it down to the 60 days 103, across both portfolios that number should come into I don\u2019t know pick up a percent or percent and a half of the service loan unit. So it still got some room to go and that's the key that I think Matt has pointed out earlier is the FTE headcount in LAS we had a 2000 person headcount drop in the company overall in the fourth quarter about half LAS have the rest of the company. The LAS percentage rate is with 8 percentage points not annualized for the quarter at 30% is still dropping its headcount but is getting flatter now we get all the old cost drive out of the portfolio. So, in terms of thinking about real estate, old systems and stuff and so that\u2019s what takes a little more time now than just the people cost . Paul Miller : Thanks you very much. Operator : We\u2019ll move next to Jim Mitchell of Buckingham Research. Jim Mitchell : Hey, good morning may be just a quick question on deposit behavior since the rate high, have you seen anything unusual I would assume will be more in the institutional side where you\u2019ve seen movement at this point and then maybe you can kindly give some update on how you\u2019re thinking about the deposit data this year? Paul Donofrio : Sure, the short answer is that we have seen no real movement of course we\u2019re very focused on making sure that we paid appropriate deposit rate, but so far there has been no movement and we have been modeling deposit betas on our interest building deposits in the high 40s. Jim Mitchell : And you still think that makes sense or do you think that\u2019s relatively conservative? Paul Donofrio : We think that makes sense and given the quality of our deposit base as Brian sort of kind of walked through already the portion we have in our consumer and GWIM franchises, the number of primary checking accounts even on the wholesale side if you look at our deposits less than 5% of them are 100% runoff deposits. So we feel good about our $1.2 trillion deposits we took even this year the deposit rating came down another basis point to 4 basis points for the all deposit, so we feel good about that modeling. Brian Moynihan : And Jim, remember that modeling is not 40% of everything. It is a lot nothing and a lot less for the first couple of months. So I think that\u2019s what you\u2019re thinking about, so if we continue along with one or two rate raises, there will be a lot more captured than as it gets on to the higher. Jim Mitchell : Right, it will be more backend weighted? Brian Moynihan : Exactly, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re asking. Jim Mitchell : Okay. And just one last question maybe on the expense side, if we look at, I mean you guys have done a good job, but if you look at your core expenses normalized for all the puts and takes it still seems like your efficiency ratio would be sort of in that 63%, 64% range and lot of your peers are well below 60%. Is this sort of you grow into the improving efficiency ratio with the revenue as you reinvest or is there do you think you can get there more quickly? Just trying to get a sense of how you get the trajectory into more in line with the peer group on the efficiency ratio side? Brian Moynihan : Well if you look at the full-year 2015 and you do those puts and takes for the things that we\u2019ve talked about for the year and you make any sort of a reasonable guess as the progress we\u2019re going to make around LAS, we\u2019re sort of in the kind of 65ish range, we\u2019re going to continue to focus on growing responsibly and working on our total expenses as we have talked earlier and so with a little help from growth and some more work on expenses we think we\u2019re in shooting range . Paul Donofrio : As we model ourselves and look at sort of the peers and so that average efficiency by business units and model against our business mix we\u2019re going to be little higher, high level wealth management in our business relative to total. But look three things on this, number one we will continue to drive \u2013 drive it down and funding all the growth in FTE for sales side we get 6% growth in consumer FTE sales side, 3% wealth management, 6% or 8%, maybe 8% global banking year-over-year. So we\u2019re paying for all that \u2013 paying for all the incentives attached, we are paying for all the infrastructure attached to it. So we're going to continue to drive it down. So just rest assured that is. And then we are not satisfied in the mid-60s efficiency ratio of the company and we should be able to drive that down and it will come from both, its hard work as we say with the rate lift and stuff which affects -- we're still affected a little bit more by the low rates structure and other people we should pick it back up. But don\u2019t think we are complacent on this. Jim Mitchell : Okay. I appreciate it, thanks. Operator : We\u2019ll move next to Glenn Schorr of Evercore. Your line is open. Glenn Schorr : Hi thanks. So I think you put the heat on a little bit on loan growth over the last couple of quarters and if you looked at lending in your primary lending segments it\u2019s picked up and I think that\u2019s good. The question I have is with new information that we have, I mean the markets digesting and anticipating, I don\u2019t know if I'll call it recession, but a lot of fear around recession on lower oil and China related fears. The question I have is, if you look at the core loan growth are you still okay running it at this level, do you feel like your customer base that you\u2019re making these new loans too are a little more insulated to the world that the market is fearful of? Paul Donofrio : We are - outside of energy, we are not seeing asset quality change nor are we see a reduction in appetite for our credit. I would remind everybody that we look we\u2019re very, very focused on our customer framework and our risk framework, but within that framework we continue to see a lot of opportunities that help our customers grow their businesses. If you look at this quarter and you just focus on the core, we had 3% quarter-over-quarter growth or an annualized growth rate of little over 12% or $22 billion, I\u2019m not going to sit here and tell you that is what is going to be next quarter, but we\u2019re not seeing material decline in conversations with our clients about how that thing grows. Brian Moynihan : I think to give additional color, if you think about it, if you go back a couple of years we grew the international business because we had to round out that franchise. We sort of slowed that down 24 months ago that started to drop in terms of growth rate and so because of the client selection criteria there is very high levels - very high clients multinational clients et cetera, but we slowed it down just to keep the company in balance and that\u2019s been on watch. If you think about the consumer you know there was a prime no longer FICO scores if you look at the coming on FICOs are higher than the portfolio still which is almost hard to believe, the charge-offs, delinquencies and both home equities, delinquencies across the wide score are going to continue to come get lower every year. This year was the lowest they have been, probably a long time in both the credit card and in home equities. And if you look at the client selection U.S., a couple things, one is you\u2019re adding officers in the middle market business, but they are going after our target clients and this is not go find the industries etcetera. So whether it is the way you land a commercial real estate which is down \u2013 which is very high end real estate developer etcetera, the way we land in this middle market is very strong. So if you look across it is client section in the middle market business has been strong. The best that we're seeing is things in our business banking, small business portfolio are actually starting to see growth there sticking to our credit risk which is the first time in many years we had to run off some stuff it came in through style Merrill and everything else that we are finally seeing nominal growth. And so I think it is client selection, we slowed down international. It sort of follows watching and in fact using your stress to make sure you stay balanced and if you look at us, yes we feel we're pretty balanced between the consumer and commercial sort of 50-50 and there within the consumer we\u2019re really sticking to our knitting which is very strong high quality, above that credit worthy borrowers. Glenn Schorr : Great, one follow up on the FA growth you noted a 5% year-on-year I\u2019m just curious, that is not a heck of a lot of core growth in that business. I\u2019m just curious how much is coming from your training programs versus recruiting both traditional and non-traditional sources? Brian Moynihan : It is coming from both. The reality is that the number one issue they are facing in the wealth and investment brokerage services revenue line is the decline in transactional revenue, and it has gone from two years ago probably $600 million a quarter -- even in not robust market times down to $300 million, $400 million in a quarter in net debt and that is part of the pay down for the annuity streams, even though they are having record net flows, it is just the pay, the revenue rate on that is less, and so that's the factor. So, it is not to do with really recruiting, and the production per FA continues to be solid at 1 million plus. It is really that core fundamental issue that they\u2019re facing and that transition is overall gone through. It is getting to the point where it is becoming less material and, i.e. material to the total revenue line from the transaction side. Paul Donofrio : I would just remind everybody that we've got significant positive loan base in that business, and so again if rates rise, we are going to see some benefit there. Glenn Schorr : All right, thank you very much. Operator : We\u2019ll move next to Steven Chubak of Nomura. Steven Chubak : Hi, good morning. Brian Moynihan : Good morning Steven. Steven Chubak : So, I actually had a quick followup to the topic that Glen was just addressing relating to GWIM and just some of the margin pressures that we have been seeing over the last couple of quarters. I wanted to get a better sense as to how much of that do you think is cyclical versus secular, whether it be DOL related pressures or just intensifying competition for advisors, and along those same lines whether a 30% margin target is still achievable once we get to a more favorable rate backdrop? Brian Moynihan : Let me start with the last one and pick up on just some comments Brian made again. The decline in margin has been because of decline in transactional revenue. In addition, over the last couple of quarters, there has been a lot of market volatility. The markets have ended down in certain months, and that affects what we make on asset management. We were hoping a better market environment. We would see some improvement in some aspects of the transactional business because there is a lot of selling of mutual fund products and other products there. And then again, as I pointed out, we\u2019ve got a business here with close to $140 billion in loans and $240 billion, $260 billionish of deposits, and as rates move, we\u2019re going to start seeing some benefit from that with which the payout ratio is quite different than on the more traditional asset management products. So, that I really do think is the revenue story that will affect margins. And again, in the first quarter of this year, we\u2019re going to see $100 reduction in expenses because of the run off of compensation programs we put in place around the Merrill merger. So I think that's what I would say about margins. What was the second part of the question? Steven Chubak : Can you just tell me about to what extent if you could at least segregate the secular versus cyclical headwind components on the revenue side, but I think that you adequately addressed that in your response. Brian Moynihan : Yes, just I think people have to think about, Steven, the margin has come down, we think it\u2019s flooring out here and will start to pick back up in part because of some of the unfundamental changes in the ATP program running off and stuff, but we have invested in a PMD program, it cost a few hundred million dollars of drag to do that, that\u2019s the right thing to actually build advisor base over time to service the clients. And the team; if you look at it underneath, the U.S. -- the flows and stuff are strong in the U.S. trust business. It is having some of its best quarters ever just because of the difference, and that it didn\u2019t have the secular run off you referred to in terms of the fee based business. So it\u2019s a good business, it does a good job to its clients. We expect more out of it and that is the job for John and Keith, and Andy and Terry to go forward. Steven Chubak : Thanks Brian. And maybe just switching over to the credit side, I appreciate the detailed disclosure you guys have given on the energy book, and we\u2019re just hoping you could provide both exposure and reserve levels maybe some area - other areas of the commodities complex, specifically metals and mining. Brian Moynihan : We are - we feel good about our mills and mining exposure. It is about $8 billion, but most of that exposure is much more short dated and much more collateral, so we feel good about that exposure. Steven Chubak : Okay. And then just as a follow-up to the initial provision guidance you\u2019ve given, just thinking about it from a modeling perspective, is it the right way for us to be thinking about the provision rate for 2016 taking that $800 million to $900 million on quarterly run rate plus whatever additional energy driven reserve building we should be contemplating which presumably is incremental? Brian Moynihan : Yes, that's not a bad way to think about it. Again remember our guidance from last quarter we said $800 million to $900 million for the first two quarters of 2016 and the way I will think about those two quarters would be, we'll see some lumpiness. But the one thing overall is that as you look at the question on the exposure that we\u2019re also paying close attention to is it sort of a demand or supply issue for oil prices, and if it\u2019s a supply issue that affects these companies and related companies demand and demand from, but if it is a demand in the broadest context, i.e., economies need to continue to slow down and that\u2019s the broader concern.  So we\u2019re looking at not only the impacts in all the portfolios, thinking about who gets the benefits on our portfolio basis from low energy cost which are serious benefits to the consumers and companies that consume energy versus those producing it. And so, there is a balance here that we\u2019ve got to think through right now that\u2019s pretty isolated the energy companies, and even if you look at consumers who work for them in our basis by ZIP code and unemployment levels and stuff, we\u2019ve seen relatively modest deterioration in the consumer side before employing these businesses. So, I think as you are thinking about it, the real question is going to come down to you for 2016 in terms of all our industriesare we in a demand driven issue, i.e., general economic issue, is the United States going to plug along and if it does, then false guidance is the right one. If you are in the supply, it is going to all be localized on these industries. Paul Donofrio : Yes, I mean if it is not demand, it\u2019s again worth emphasizing. There are a lot of people who are helped by low oil prices that helps our asset quality, not only on the consumer side but also in places like India and manufacturers all around the world. Steven Chubak : Okay. All right thanks guys, very helpful and thanks for taking my question. Operator : We\u2019ll move next to Eric Wasserstrom of Guggenheim. Eric Wasserstrom : Thanks very much. I was just wondering if you could help me think through a little bit your GAAP and risk weighted assets over the first half of the year given the growth dynamics that are pretty robust in some of the run-offs and then also some of the changes that are going through on the RWA calculations? Paul Donofrio : So you\u2019re talking about the first half of 2016? Eric Wasserstrom : Correct. Paul Donofrio : Well on a standardized basis, I think you\u2019re going to see RWA trend up if we\u2019re able to grow deposits and loans. On an advanced basis, there\u2019s all sorts of puts and takes there. I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll see as much growth as you would on a standardized basis, on an advanced basis yes, as you were on a standardized basis as we continue to work on RWA. Eric Wasserstrom : Okay. And so what are the -- kind of what are the implications of that then for your regulatory capital ratios? Paul Donofrio : Well we need to get to regulatory from a CET1 under an advanced basis. Our goal is to get to 10% plus or above by 2019. So we\u2019re at 9.8, I feel like we got the time to do that. We're certainly not going to need to take all that time. We would expect to get there soon, but it is impacted changes in rates, changes and OCI, we are returning, we are hopefully returning capital, but we\u2019re not - we feel like we\u2019re on track to get to 10% plus an appropriate buffer there. Brian Moynihan : And the only other thing I would add is, we still have some opportunities to optimize RWA from an advanced perspective, that\u2019s in two fundamental areas. It\u2019s always tough. You can do in markets and other areas, but in two fundamental areas, one is the extra RWA we got on the wholesale side when we exited parallel run, that is not a permanent thing. We need to work on \u2013 work with our regulators and hopefully over time we can make some improvements there. The other one is operational risk, we have $500 billion of RWA operations with some of the advanced approach. That is 25% more net higher to bank and that operational risk is for businesses that we are no longer in it with products we no longer sell, it\u2019s for a risk profile that we no longer tolerate. So again that will take time, but that is another opportunity for us to lower RWA through an advanced perspective. Eric Wasserstrom : Thanks and if I can just sneak in one more, and when you talk about an appropriate buffer are you thinking in method one or method two as a baseline? Brian Moynihan : I think a buffer to the capital, we\u2019re thinking we\u2019re basically thinking we need to be above the 10%, we would say 25 to 50 basis points would be where -- Eric Wasserstrom : Got it. Okay, thanks very much. Operator : We will move next to the site of Ken Usdin of Jefferies. Ken Usdin : Thanks good morning. Just a quick follow-up on the loan growth side, I know you talked about the credit quality underneath the commercial side, but after 13%, 14% loan growth a year, do you think you can maintain that type of pace of growth given some of the concerns we\u2019ve seen underlying even if quality is holding up? So just I guess your general outlook for loan growth rates and can it match or maintain what you did last year? Thanks. Brian Moynihan : Yes, look I\u2019m not sure we are in the business of giving guidance on loan growth. We think we can grow if we\u2019re looking for some perspective from us, I wouldn\u2019t even call it guidance, mid-single digit is what we hope we can accomplish. Ken Usdin : Okay. Continue to be driven by commercial would you say? Brian Moynihan : I think it\u2019s going to be, continued to be driven by commercial, but you're going to see growth in consumers as well. Ken Usdin : Yep, and just a quick second one, you\u2019ve been growing the mortgage business again, what is your outlook for continuing to take share in the mortgage business and kind of -- have we seen the bottoming of results on the fee side of mortgage? Brian Moynihan : Well, we are - in our mortgage business, I think we are focused on originating prime and sort of non-conforming loans. I would - there has been good progress, I think if you look over the last year, the number of non-conforming loans that we are originating has increased meaningfully. And I would remind you that those loans we booked on our balance sheet. So that\u2019s NBI when you\u2019re booking, when you\u2019re selling less loans, it is going to affect your NBI income, but it is going to come through [indiscernible] on a more annualized basis. Ken Usdin : Absolutely. Paul Donofrio : From a broader -- leave aside the fees because of the geography and how the accounting works and when you put 60%, 70% loans on balance sheet, in terms of overall production we expect to continue to make progress because you can see that numbers that we\u2019re going to \u2013 as other people are flattening out, we continue to have lots of opportunities with our core customers setting out and still that are creditworthy in our customer base, we are still getting to move it elsewhere and that is what the team is chipping away. And it is never going to be the hugest business of Bank of America compared to things like the Merrill Lynch business consumer, the credit card business in consumer, but we expect to get broader market share from each of the segments. Brian Moynihan : Yes, I think it is interesting, I am considering entirely this is directly 100% correlating we've done all the work, but we\u2019ve added sales professionals in our branches that are focused on originating mortgages that are more prime oriented. We\u2019ve got them working with our GWIM specialists. That client group is generally more prime oriented, and we see progress, we see the prime loans growing. Ken Usdin : All right. Thanks guys. Operator : We\u2019ll move next to Brian Foran of Autonomous Research. Brian Foran : Hi, good morning. I guess on commercial, if you could follow up on the ex-energy comments, in you experience what are some of the best leading indicators for the commercial credit cycle and what kind of trends have you seen, again ex-energy and those leading indicators over the past couple months that gives you confidence that thinks you\u2019re stable? Brian Moynihan : Well, I would think about that. We spend a lot of time. Our credit people do spend a lot of time just homing [ph] through that portfolio and looking at cash flows from the companies and making sure we understand the collateral, making sure we fully understand our structures, so I think it\u2019s just a lot of locking and tackling and talking to clients and making sure we understand what\u2019s going on with their businesses in terms of the energy portfolio. I would emphasize again that outside of the energy portfolio, we are not seeing movement in NPL and criticize in our assets. Our NPLs continue to come down. Brian Foran : And then if I could ask a follow up along the same lines on the consumer side, I guess two parts, one you made the point that even in energy heavy geographies, you are not seeing any adverse change in the consumer? In parts specifically just since it is such a big credit line are early delinquencies still coming in better than expected or are they stable or how would you characterize the current early delinquency trends and then on home equity since again that\u2019s another big outsize portion of the reserve, is there any update you can give us on how the first wave of HELOC recasts or switches to amortization schedules have performed versus what you had modeled? Brian Moynihan : Sure, so in terms of the card, we look at our credit losses. They are at low points, historic low points, and they have been bumping around at that level. We\u2019ve seen a little bit of increase the last couple of quarters, but that again I think is just a reflection of things that's bumping around at really low levels. In terms of the home equity end of draw, based on the volume we\u2019ve seen to-date, which we've seen a lot of volume, the portfolio is performing in line with our expectations and we continue to monitor the end of draw portfolio and continue to work with our customers to manage the risk. And I just would remind everybody that these borrowers have paid through the downturn, and this portfolio continues to improve as home prices improve. The risk is an ongoing part of our reserve process and we think we\u2019re all reserved. Brian Foran : Thank you very much. Brian Moynihan : Just on card, and yes it was 30 days, delinquency or 90, they came down during the course of -- from the end of '14, all the way through '15, and in both cases is running at multiple year lows in both percentage wise and nominal amounts, so we\u2019re seeing no deterioration of credit in either of those and the same with of the home equities. It is just in the home equities, we just have a little more clean up because of the legacy portfolio in there. Operator : We\u2019ll move next to Brennan Hawken of UBS. Your line is open. Brian Moynihan : Brennan? Operator : And for your interruption we lost Mr. Hawken. [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll move next to Mike Mayo of CLSA. Go ahead please. Mike Mayo : Hi, I have one question for Paul, one for Brian. Paul, lower energy prices you said can help certain segments such as consumers. Can you give any examples of that and also on the energy topic, if oil stays at 30 then your provisions for energy would go up by how much, I didn\u2019t understand the answer from before? Paul Donofrio : Well, let me take the last one first, so we\u2019ve got a reserve on our energy portfolio of $500 million. That is 6% of those two filled factors that we can call high risk and we have done modeling, stress test modeling at various oil prices. The one we have been talking about on this call has been at $30, and that\u2019s over nine quarters, and so if oil stays at $30 for nine quarters, we would think that our losses over those nine quarters would be $700 million. Again that will go against the $500 we already have reserved, and one would presume we're building reserves during that time period to make up the difference. Brian Moynihan : So Mike when you look at consumer benefits from the oil and gas, just to give you a simple thing, if you look at our card base in the fourth quarter of '15, the spending on debit, credit cards rose 4% from the fourth quarter of '14, and if gas prices would have been stable, they would have grown at 5.7%. And so what that means is consumers had effectively on that base of 1.7% to-date received the benefit of year-over-year. If you translate that to dollars, round numbers as $20 million a day is less spending on gasoline by our consumers in our portfolios per day. And from like $90 million down to $70-ish million or something like that, that is the benefit they get, and so for a large number of consumers median income, the cash flow increases and that gives them more money to spend. Mike Mayo : Okay, do you think people are being too negative on the decline in oil prices, you\u2019re implying it has a nice simulative effect, but people sure aren\u2019t taking that these days. Brian Moynihan : I think Mike, it comes down to a question whether you think this is a - the oil price is a reflection of a broader issue of growth in economies, we\u2019re going to get slow growth 2.5% in the U.S. and IMF [ph] said I guess 3.5% in the world. If you\u2019re going to get that in '16, it is going to be isolated. This negatives could be isolated, the oil companies and related commodity producers just because of slow growth environment. If you are saying this is going to be a much different economic scenario than most [indiscernible] so called consensus predicts. It\u2019s a broader based problem, but right now it's really an oversupply of oil driving prices down, and that\u2019s impacting the people in the industry and rest of the consumers, that means corporate customer and consumers that use oil and energy are getting a good benefit. Paul Donofrio : And again Mike, the only thing I would say is, I mean Brian is spot on, but the demand issue is kind of we are going to see it in other parts of the economy, however, we have not seen that yet, we have not seen change in our asset quality outside of energy. Mike Mayo : And then if I can shift gears Brian, I know I have asked this question in other years, but I know you are not satisfied with the mid 60s core efficiency ratio, and I know you\u2019re not satisfied with a single-digit ROE. So what is your specific financial target for efficiency and ROE and what is your timeframe to get there? Brian Moynihan : As we said, we ran about 9%, it has just been travelling about 9.5% for the year and return to annual common equity. We believe we have a path to get that to 12. Rates get us part of it and hard work on expenses and core revenue growth and driving gets us the rest of it, and so LAS expense drop-in, and we're chipping away that, if you look from '14 to '15, we made substantial steps, and we will continue to drive away. We haven\u2019t put a specific timeframe on it. It\u2019s just a goal to keep driving, and we will drive beyond that. On efficiency, it follows that - as an efficiency, it follows that sort of math. Right now, we are operating 66%, 67%, probably normalized for 2015 and between LAS we can drop that down to 65%, and that is just hard work and we\u2019re grinding away every day. You're seeing loans grow, you're seeing deposits grow, and so you should see improvement in 2016. Mike Mayo : Any expense initiative plan Paul since you've had a couple of quarters now to take a look at that? Are we looking for like an extra billion or kind of like a new BAC program or what are you thinking about there? Brian Moynihan : Expenses are on our mind every day at Bank of America. We have - everybody focuses on expense discipline that\u2019s translating to our culture under our simplified and improved program where the teams are always coming up with ideas to make it simpler for our customers, to make it simple for our employees, and improve the expenses of the company, that is how we\u2019re going to achieve our objectives around core expenses that we talked about on this call. We\u2019re all very focused on expenses. Mike Mayo : All right. Thank you. Operator : And it appears that we have no further questions at this time. I'd like to return the program back to our host for any concluding remarks. Brian Moynihan : Thank you everyone. We look forward to talking to you next quarter. Operator : This does conclude today's program. You may now disconnect your lines and everyone have a great day.",

[Operator Instructions] Please note this call is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Mr. Lee McEntire. Please go ahead, sir. Lee McEntire : Good morning. Thanks to everyone on the phone, as well as the webcast, for joining us this morning for the First Quarter 2016 Results. Hopefully everybody has had a chance to review the earnings release. The documents are available on our website. Before I turn the call over to Brian and Paul, let me remind you we may make some forward-looking statements. For further information on those, please refer to either our earnings release docs or our website or the SEC filings. Let me just remind you, please limit the number of questions so that we can get to everyone\u2019s \u2013 so we can get through all the questions that everyone has. And with that, I\u2019m pleased to now turn it over to Brian Moynihan, our Chairman, CEO, for some opening comments before Paul Donofrio, our CFO, goes through the details. Brian? Brian Moynihan : Thank you, Lee, and good morning to everyone. We want to thank you for joining us to review our first quarter results. Today we reported $2.7 billion in earnings this quarter, or $0.21 per diluted share. As you can see in the results, two large items impacted this quarter\u2019s results. We recorded negative market related NII adjustments for bond premium amortization. That adjustment alone cost us $0.07 per diluted share. And we also recorded a $0.05 per share diluted share cost of seasonal retirement eligible incentives. When you think about revenue, net interest income, excluding that bond premium adjustment, was $10.6 billion this quarter. This is improvement linked quarter and year-over-year. Our loans are growing across the franchise and, compared to the prior year, are up 11% in our business segments. In addition, deposit growth remains very strong. Our deposits were up $64 billion from last year or 6% to over $1.2 trillion. This growth reflects our progress to grow responsibly and deepen relationships with all of our core customers. Moving to non-interest income, it declined year-over-year. Of note, the downdraft in that was driven by Capital Markets and related activities and, to a lesser degree, mortgage servicing and other fees as we continue to wind down our third-party servicing book. However, the other banking sources of non-interest income were relatively stable. Switching to costs we continue to drive costs down in this Company. Costs year-over-year in the first quarter were down 6%. FTEs were down 3%. That is $1 billion per quarter, $4 billion on an annualized basis. And if you focus just on the core costs excluding our LAS and litigation, those were down $600 million quarter \u2013 from first quarter of last year or $2.4 billion annualized. We\u2019re going to keep driving those costs own as we continue to move forward through 2016. Turning to Slide 3 and looking at the business segment earnings, you can see the good year-over-year results because of the operating leverage in those businesses. The only exception is the results in Global Banking, which were negatively impacted by the increased energy related reserves. The combination of business segments outside the All Other group earned $4.5 billion in quarter one this year compared to $3.9 billion in quarter one of 2015. Offsetting those earnings were the $1.9 billion loss in All Other. That loss primarily reflects the two large adjustments I mentioned earlier and some legacy litigation costs. You can also see the returns and efficiency ratios for each of our segments and note, with the exception of LAS, which came close to breaking even this quarter, they earned above their cost of capital. Moving to Slide 4, during the period of \u2013 during the first quarter, there was a lot of talk with the market volatility, the Company buying surrounding the question about global growth and the forward-looking economic picture. However, we don\u2019t see any evidence of our customer base changing. Spending by consumers remains strong and is up year-over-year over 4%. Loan demand remains solid throughout the franchise. And we continue to position our Company to face any potential economic outcome. When you think about this, it\u2019s important to remember the work we\u2019ve done over the past years to simplify and strengthen our foundation. We remain a different Company today than that which had entered the last downturn. We start with a clear strategy to serve the core financial needs of the customers. We\u2019ve gotten out of businesses, portfolios, products and client relationships that don\u2019t meet those strategic goals. We simplified the Company in every area. We cut the number of legal entities in half and we also reduced costs through programs like New BAC that produced a loan more than $8 billion in annual savings and our SIM program which continues to operate today. At the same time we\u2019ve continued to invest in the areas we can grow. $3 billion in technology-related growth initiatives, especially in areas of digital practice, whether it\u2019s in Consumer Banking, Commercial Banking, where we lead the industry with mobile and online platforms. We\u2019ve also invested more in client facing teammates, funding that investment through elimination of bureaucracy and simplification and elimination of management jobs. We believe that we have to continue to drive the productivity and will continue to do so in 2016. In the end, when you think about all this, it makes our Company more resolvable. As you all know, we received the latest input from our regulators on our resolution plans yesterday. Those plans were filed nine months ago and we\u2019ve been busy at work since the day they were filed to continue to remedy the deficiencies and shortcomings stated in those plans and we will do so by the October submission date. As you move to Slide 5 you can also see the financial foundation that we\u2019ve built in this Company. Liquidity and capital at record levels. Tangible book value per share, the marker of what we as shareholders own in our Company now stands at $16.17 and has improved over $5 a share over the last few years even as we\u2019ve taken the hits that are now largely behind us. Our funding structure continues to improve. Long-term debt has been cut dramatically; deposits have increased over 20% and most of that growth is coming through our Consumer Banking and Wealth Management segments. Our loan book is now well balanced, half consumer, half commercial. And importantly, the consumer piece is much more secured lending than it was before the last crisis. As we look in Global Markets, whether it\u2019s our Level 3 assets which are more risky, the total trading assets or VaR, they are all down significantly over the last few years. So as you can see we\u2019ve simplified our Company and our operating structure. As we look ahead to 2016, we remain focused on what we can control. We intend to keep driving the core customer activity you see on the loan and deposit and customer flow growth in each and every business, focusing intently on the Wealth Management and Global Markets businesses to take advantage as markets have stabilized. We\u2019ll continue to drive on focusing on costs and drive those costs down and we\u2019ll continue to drive to deliver more capital to you as we did in the first quarter as investors. With that, let me hand it over to Paul. Paul Donofrio : Thanks, Brian. Good morning, everybody, and thanks for joining us. Starting on Slide 6, we present a summary of the income statement returns for this quarter, highlighting comparisons to Q4 2015 as well as Q1 2015. Earnings this quarter were $2.7 billion or $0.21 per share. These earnings include the negative impact of the FAS 91 market-related adjustment, which reduced EPS by $0.07. They also include $850 million of FAS 123 retirement eligible incentive expense, which reduced EPS by $0.05. For comparative purposes, the aggregate impact of these two same items in Q1 2015 reduced EPS by $0.08. Revenue on an FTE basis was $19.7 billion this quarter. Adjusted for FAS 91, revenue was $20.9 billion, a decline of $700 million from Q1 2015 on a similarly adjusted basis. This decline was driven by the reduction in sales and trading revenue and IB fees, as well as mortgage banking income offset by improvement in adjusted NII. Expenses were $14.8 billion, approximately $1 billion or 6% lower than a year ago, driven by good discipline across the entire Company. Before moving to the balance sheet I want to note an adjustment to the financial statements this quarter, reclassifying some operating leases. We moved $6 billion of leases to other assets and we made conforming reclassifications to prior periods to improve comparability. This reclassification had no effect on net income. However, as a result of this reclassification, quarterly NII is lower by approximately $50 million, other income is higher by approximately $180 billion and depreciation expense is higher by about $130 million. While these changes are small and don\u2019t affect profits, I wanted to note them so that you can more easily adjust your models. Turning to Slide 7 and the balance sheet in the balance sheet. Total assets increased $41 billion from Q4 driven by higher Global Markets repo activity as well as increased cash. Deposits rose $20 billion from Q4 while loans increased $4 billion. Driven by deposit inflows, liquidity rose to $525 billion. Time to required funding, while down, remains strong at three years. And note that the first quarter included the $8.5 billion settlement payment to Bank of New York Mellon as trustee in the article 77 suit, which was reserved for over four years ago. Tangible common equity of $167 billion improved $4.7 billion from Q4. On a per share basis, tangible book value increased to $16.17, up 9% from Q1 2015. Turning to regulatory metrics : as a reminder, we report regulatory capital under the advanced approaches. Our CET1 transition ratio under Basel III ended the quarter at 10.3% and really is only comparable to Q4 as prior periods were reported under the standardized approach prior to our exit from parallel run. On a fully phased-in basis, CET1 capital improved $3.4 billion to $158 billion as improvements from earnings and OCI were partially offset by dividends and repurchases. Under the advanced approaches, compared to Q4 2015, the CET1 ratio increased 30 basis points to 10.1% and is now above our fully phased-in 2019 requirement. RWA decreased roughly $18 billion driven by reductions related to retail exposures as credit quality improved. We also provide our capital metrics under the standardized approach. Here our CET1 ratio improved to 11% with the same capital improvement as advanced but less of an RWA improvement given standardized is less risk sensitive. Supplemental leverage ratios for both the Parent and the Bank continue to exceed U.S. regulatory minimums that take effect in 2018. Turning to Slide 8, we had solid loan and deposit growth in the quarter. Reported loans of $901 billion on an end of period basis increased $4 billion from Q4 and are up $28 billion or 3% from Q1 2015. Loans in our primary lending segments were up $14 billion or 2% from Q4 which is 8% on an annualized basis. We continued to see solid commercial loan growth in Global Banking. In Consumer Banking we continue to see strong growth in consumer real estate and vehicle lending. Lastly, in Wealth Management we also saw continued growth in consumer real estate. Loans outside the primary lending segments in LAS and All Other were down $10 billion from Q4 driven by continued pay downs of first and second lien mortgages as well as loan sales. During the quarter, we sold FHA loans totaling $2.7 billion and NPLs and other delinquent loans of roughly $1 billion, recording a small gain on sales and other income. Turning to deposits, on an ending basis they reached $1.2 trillion this quarter, growing $64 billion or 6% from Q1 2015. Growth was led by our consumer businesses. Consumer Banking grew $43 billion or 8% year-over-year. GWIM grew nearly $17 billion, a 7% pace, and Global Banking grew at a 3% pace. Turning to asset quality on Slide 9. Outside the energy sector, credit quality is strong. Total net charge-offs were $1.1 billion in Q1 and Q4. We had some immaterial movements this quarter from minor adjustments but overall very little change in consumer losses. Commercial losses declined slightly from Q4 despite a slight increase in energy charge-offs. Provision of $1 billion in Q1 was up $187 million from Q4. While net charge-offs were flat, total reserve release declined as reserve releases in Consumer were mostly offset by reserve increases in commercial driven by energy exposures. On slide 10, we provide credit quality data on our Consumer portfolio. Net charge-offs declined $41 million from Q4. Consumer real estate charge-offs benefited from continued portfolio improvement and fewer one time items, primarily collateral valuation adjustments on consumer real estate. Adjusting for those items, consumer net charge-offs were relatively flat versus Q4. Delinquency levels and NPLs improved and reserve coverage remains strong. Moving to commercial credit on Slide 11, net charge-offs improved $35 million. A decline in non-energy net charge-offs from Q4 more than offset a modest increase in energy losses. Energy charge-offs increased $17 million from Q4 to roughly $100 million in the quarter. Given that asset quality outside energy remains relatively stable, let\u2019s focus on energy. We continue to support our energy clients while managing limits and actively engaging with stressed borrowers. Our overall committed energy exposures declined slightly from Q4 while utilized exposures were up by $500 million. As discussed last quarter, within energy, we believe two subsectors, refining and marketing, as well as vertically integrated, which by the way tend to be large market cap and/or sovereign supported. These two subsectors are less dependent on oil prices and therefore carry less risk than our exposures in E&P and oilfield services. Looking at our $7.7 billion utilized exposure to the higher risk E&P and oilfield services clients, we saw a decline of $600 million from Q4 as payoffs and charge-offs more than offset draw downs. In addition, this quarter we moved $1.6 billion of our energy exposure to reservable criticized, and we added $525 million to our energy reserves. We made these adjustments based upon another quarter of not only low oil prices but also volatile prices. This moves our energy reserve to just over $1 billion. And while these reserves cover also energy portfolio, they would represent 13% of our $7.7 billion E&P and oilfield services exposures. We believe that percentage is probably more relevant as you compare exposures across the industry. Turning to Slide 12, net interest income on an FTE basis was $9.4. Included in NII this quarter was a FAS 91 negative $1.2 billion market-related adjustment for bond premium amortization. This adjustment in Q1 2015 was a negative $500 million. And including TruPS-related charges, Q4 was also negative $500 million. Adjusted NII of $10.6 billion improved approximately $500 million compared to Q1 2015, excluding FAS 91, and improved $100 million from Q4 after also excluding the TruPS charge. Several factors contributed to the improvement from Q4. We had good commercial loan growth funded by deposits. We also had about $100 million in seasonal benefits in Q1. Offsetting these factors we had one last day of interest and lower dividends on our Federal Reserve stock as required to contribute to the Highway Trust Fund. Lower long-term rates also offset some of the benefits of the Fed rate hike in December pressuring NII. Lower long-term rates was also the driver of increased asset sensitivity in the quarter. As of 3/31, and instantaneous 100 basis point parallel increase in rates is estimated to increase NII by approximately $6 billion over the subsequent year. About 40% of this estimated $6 billion increase comes from short end rate improvement and the rest is from long end rate improvement split equally between FAS 91 and reinvestment at higher rates. Turning to Slide 13, non-interest expense was $14.8 billion in the quarter. That is $1 billion or 6% lower than Q1 2015 driven by good expense discipline across the Company. Legacy asset costs excluding litigation \u2013 excuse me, Legacy Assets Servicing costs excluding litigation were $729 million this quarter, declining $292 million from Q1 2015 and $64 million from Q4. Litigation expense of $388 million was in line with Q1 2015 as we work to resolve remaining legacy issues. First quarter expense also included FAS 123 annual retirement costs of $850 million, slightly below Q1 2015. First quarter of both years also included about $300 million of seasonally elevated payroll tax expense. Adjusting for all these items, i.e. the litigation, LAS, FAS 123 and the elevated payroll tax, expenses were $12.5 billion. This decline of $600 million from Q1 2015 was driven by : lower revenue-related costs associated with sales and trading in investment banking, as well as revenue in our Wealth Management business; the roll off of advisory retention awards put in place after the combination with Merrill Lynch; and lastly, SIM initiatives that are improving productivity and helping us lower costs so that we can continue to invest in growth. Our employee base is down 3% from Q1 2015 and increases in client facing professionals were more than offset by reductions in LAS and other operations staff. Lastly before leaving expense highlights I want to remind you that quarterly FDIC insurance expense is set to increase at the large banks until the deposit insurance fund reaches 1.35%. For us, this will increase expense by approximately $100 million pretax starting in Q3 2016. Okay, turning to the business segments, starting with Consumer Banking on Slide 14. Consumer earned $1.8 billion, 22% better than Q1 last year. These earnings reflect continued core customer growth coupled with strong expense management. Lower provision expense from continued improvement in asset quality also benefited the bottom line. This work generated a strong 24% return on allocated capital. Note that allocated capital increased slightly for 2016 pursuant to our normal capital allocation reviews completed in Q1. On Slide 15 we focus on some important trends. First, in the upper left, we continue to lead the industry in a number of ways, as you can see from the stats. Revenue increased $242 million or 3% from Q1 2015 as NII growth more than offset lower non-interest income. Net interest income benefited from higher client balances. Non-interest income was down due to lower mortgage banking income offset by increases in card income and service charges. We continue to see mortgage banking income come down given our strategy to book more of our originations on the balance sheet. Expenses declined 2% from Q1 2015. On the bottom left, you can see the year-over-year decline in FTEs as Mobile Banking growth continues to help us optimize our delivery network. Note, while overall FTEs are down year-over-year, sales specialists are up almost 900 from Q1 2015. Lastly, our deposit franchise continues to drive operating leverage. Our cost of deposits as a percent of average deposits continues to improve and now stands at 171 basis points which we believe is best-in-class in the industry. Focusing on Mobile Banking users in the upper right for a minute, we added 910,000 net new mobile users this quarter. We now have nearly 20 million active users and deposit transactions from mobile devices now represents 16% of deposit transactions. Interestingly, this quarter we added more net new users than any quarter in the last three years and we continue to add new features and capabilities, improving convenience and satisfaction. One way we are promoting adoption is by deploying digital ambassadors in our financial centers. Digital ambassadors engage with customers who come to our branches to transact. They educate these customers on alternatives to branch banking which are not only more convenient for them but also less expensive for us. Digital sales, digital appointments, digital satisfaction all continue to achieve new highs. Focusing on client balances, you can see Merrill Edge brokerage assets are up 7% from Q1 2015 on strong flows offset by lower valuations. Moving to the bottom right of the page, note that loans were up 8% in Q1 2015 on strong, mortgage and auto growth. Okay, moving to Slide 16, this is a new page that presents some statistics around loan growth and the quality of originations in our Consumer segment. Starting with card we issued 1.2 million cards in the quarter, which is a bit lower than the past few quarters. Average balances were impacted by the sale of a $1.7 billion non-strategic card portfolio late in Q4. Adjusting for that divestiture, loans were up from Q4. Spending on credit card, adjusted for divestitures, was up 8% compared to Q1 2015. As we\u2019ve discussed many times and shown here, we are originating high FICO loans that have produced very low loss rates and strong risk-adjusted margins currently exceeding 9%. Moving to vehicle lending, one sees similar high-quality, low risk lending stats. Average book FICOs are around 780 and loss rates are low. Also, the tenor of these loans is relatively conservative compared to the industry as nearly 90% of our loans are less than 73 months. Margins obviously aren\u2019t as high as credit card, but average balances are growing well across multiple channels within the business. Our underwriting standards are producing similar results in consumer real estate lending which is presented on the bottom of the page. Net loss rates on first lien mortgages have been negligible. Remember, we began booking these loans in the Consumer segment in the first quarter of 2014 and the macro consumer environment has been healthy, particularly for high FICO borrowers. Turning to Slide 17, Global Wealth & Investment Management produced earnings of $740 million, up 13% from Q1 2015. Year-over-year revenue was down but expenses declined more, pretax margin to 26%. Overall, revenue declined 2% from Q1 2015 as strong NII growth was more than offset by lower market sensitive revenue. Asset management revenue declined on lower market values. Transactional revenue was also down and continues to be impacted by the shifting of activity from brokerage to managed relationships as well as market uncertainty. NII benefited from solid deposit and loan growth. Non-interest expense in the first quarter of 2016 benefited from the fully amortized advisory retention awards given at the time of the Merrill Lynch merger. We have not seen a noticeable attrition as a result of this. Lower revenue-related incentives also contributed to lower expense versus Q1 2015. Moving to Slide 18, despite lower market levels, we continued to see overall solid client engagement and we continue to invest in the business, growing client facing professionals year-over-year. Client balances are $2.5 trillion. Long-term AUM flows were down this quarter as a result of market volatility which impacted client behavior. Average deposits grew $9 billion from Q4 and average loans also grew this quarter concentrated in consumer real estate lending. Turning to Slide 19, Global Banking earned $1.1 billion, down from both comparative periods as energy reserves weighed on results. Despite this increased provision expense, Global Banking was able to deliver a 12% return on allocated capital. And note that we allocated $2 billion more in capital to Global Banking for 2016, pursuant to our annual evaluation of allocated capital. Global Banking continues to drive solid loan growth within its risk and client frameworks and this drove a nice increase year-over-year in NII, mitigated to some degree by spread compression. That NII improvement, combined with revenue growth from credit cards and treasury fees, partially offset a decline in investment banking and other marks on loans and hedges. Noninterest expense, compared to Q1 2015, reflects a decline in revenue-related expense offset by the cost of adding sales professionals over the past 12 months. Looking at trends on Slide 20 and comparing to Q1 last year, it was obviously a tough quarter for the capital markets with spikes in volatility causing declines in client activity. However, clients still have financing needs and here is where the diversity and strength of our franchise allows us to continue to deliver for them even when capital markets are less attractive. You can see that trend in our average loans and lease balances, which increased again this quarter and are up 14% year-over-year. Growth in loans was broad-based across C&I, CRE and leasing, although recently we have slow growth in CRE. Spread compression on average across all our customer sizes has moderated relative to a year ago. Average deposits also increased from Q1 2015, up $11 billion or 4%. We remain focused on our deposit mix which is strong with only 3% classified as 100% runoff balances. On the other hand, total firm-wide IB fees of $1.2 billion were down 22% from Q1 2015 with declines broad-based across M&A, DCM and ECM. Switching to Global Markets on Slide 21 and comparing Q1 last year, again the challenging market condition caused revenue compared to Q1 2015 to be down. The quarter included a benefit from the resolution of a litigation matter and we also had lower revenue-related costs compared to Q1 2015. All of this resulted in Global Markets reporting earnings just under $1 billion. Reported revenue was down year-over-year, but note that last year DVA negatively impacted revenue versus added to revenue this quarter. Total revenue, excluding DVA, while up from Q4, was down 17% from Q1 last year on lower sales and trading revenue as well as Global Markets share of lower IB fees. Non-interest expense declined 23% from Q1 2015 driven by lower litigation. Adjusting for litigation, expenses were down 9% as a result of lower revenue-related expenses demonstrating a disciplined approach to compensation. Moving to trends on the next slide and focusing on the components of our sales and trading performance, sales and trading revenue of $13.3 billion excluding net DVA is up 25% from Q4 with improvement in both FICC and equity, but down 16% from Q1 last year. Versus Q1 2015, FICC sales and trading up $2.3 billion fell 17% reflecting a tough environment for credit-related products as well as a tough comparison to a strong Q1 2015 in currencies. Equity trading was $1 billion, declining 11% reflecting weaker trading performance in a challenging market environment. Average trading assets continued to trend down as did VaR which remains at historically low levels. Turning to Legacy Assets & Servicing on Slide 23. This segment lost $40 million this quarter. I\u2019m not going to spend a lot of time here as trends are consistent with past quarters. Revenue was down a bit from lower servicing fees as the portfolio of service loans declines. Revenue was also impacted by lower net hedge results. As the portfolio shrinks, we continue to lower servicing costs particularly with respect to delinquent loans. The number of 60 plus day delinquent first mortgage loans serviced continue to decline and is now only 88,000 units. Excluding litigation expense this quarter was $729 million, dropping nearly $300 million from Q1 2015 and down $64 million from Q4. On Slide 24 we show All Other which reported a loss of $1.9 billion. Results were impacted by the $1.2 billion FAS 91 market-related adjustment, the FAS 123 seasonal retirement eligible incentive costs and litigation costs. The loss here is higher than Q1 2015 for a number of reasons. First, the market-related adjustment is more negative this year than last. Second, we had higher gains on sales of loans in Q1 2015 than this period. Third, provision expense is higher as both periods had a benefit from provision but this quarter that benefit was smaller than Q1 2015. Lastly, litigation costs were higher this quarter versus Q1 2015 as we worked down legacy issues. The effective tax rate for the quarter was about 28%, which is better than we expect for the full year absent any unusual items. One expected item that we want to bring to your attention is another UK tax rate reduction recently proposed in the Chancellor\u2019s budget. We expect this to be signed into law in Q3 and will result in a tax charge of about $350 million to reduce the carrying value of our UK DTA. The vast majority of this charge will not impact regulatory capital. Okay, so let me offer a few takeaways as I finish. Given the market volatility, revenue growth was challenging this quarter. However, we compensated for this by managing expenses well. If one adjusts this period\u2019s reported results for the noncash FAS 91 market-related NII amount and the FAS 123 costs, earnings are largely in line with recent quarters. You can see progress most clearly in our business segments which don\u2019t include these adjustments. Taken as a whole, the segments, not including All Other, improved earnings by 16% versus Q1 2015. The drivers of this improvement were solid loan and deposit growth across our customer groups. Net charge-offs were largely unchanged as modest increases in energy were mitigated by other improvements. We strengthened our capital liquidity and we returned $1.5 billion in common dividends repurchased to shareholders. To Brian\u2019s earlier point, we have done years of work to simplify the Company and reduce risk. With $167 billion in tangible common equity, $12 billion in credit reserves and twice the amount of liquidity of a few years ago, we believe we are well prepared to help customers and clients in good and bad times and we are focused on growing earnings in many different economic scenarios. With that, let\u2019s open it up to Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We can take our first question from Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead. Jim Mitchell : Hey, good morning. Just maybe let\u2019s focus \u2013 I\u2019ll focus my question on expenses and then I\u2019ll get back in the queue. But I think outside of incentive comp expenses generally were better than I was expecting and how much of that is to simplify and improve and how much more do you think there is to do on some of these core expenses I guess is number one? Paul Donofrio : Look about from Q4 to Q1, $300 million in core expense decline. $100 million of that is the roll off of the amortization of the awards we gave to advisors around the Merrill Lynch acquisition. $200 million of it is just good, solid expense discipline being driven by SIM and other initiatives. If you look at the supplement you\u2019re going to see expenses came down in nearly every category. Jim Mitchell : And you think there\u2019s more to do there? I guess maybe in the context of your discussion around digitization and Consumer, that seems like that could be a longer-term tailwind. Do you guys agree? And do you think that\u2019s a material mover or just more incremental? Brian Moynihan : Jim, I think there\u2019s a lot more to do here because at the end of the day adjusting the efficiency ratio for the two major adjustments, which won\u2019t reoccur next quarter, you get in the mid-60 \u2013 66, 67 and we need to drive that down in the low 60s even with the realities of the wealth management business not being as profitable and a big part of our revenue stream but very return on capital beneficial. So then if you flip and say how are we going to get down there? You\u2019re exactly right. If you look, we drifted down even further this quarter. Numbers of branches, smaller numbers of customers, but deposits are up. If you look at headcount in Consumer we continue to reposition it towards the sales and relationship management side and away from the transactional side. And so that digitization, which is \u2013 we\u2019re at $19.6 million, Mobile Banking consumer customers. And interesting enough we\u2019re growing on the online customer base, meaning computer-based customers grew over 1 million customers from last year\u2019s first quarter. So all that just drives more and more transactions, more and more cost structure of the day-to-day transactional stuff into those environments and saves us money overall. And at 170 basis points, there was a time when that was 300 basis points five, six, seven years ago. We thought we\u2019d got it into the low 2s \u2013 220, 240, and thought that was pretty good and now we\u2019re at 170, and my guess is we continue to push it down. Jim Mitchell : That\u2019s helpful. And maybe just one ticky tack question on the FDIC charge. It wasn\u2019t clear. Is that an annual expense or is that going to be quarterly at $100 million? Paul Donofrio : It\u2019s going to be quarterly $100 million beginning in Q3 until the fund gets up to its adequate level and then it will come down. Jim Mitchell : Okay, all right. Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Matt O'Connor: Good morning. Brian Moynihan : Good morning. Matt O'Connor: Any outlook you can provide in terms of the potential for additional reserve boosts related to energy? We heard one bank yesterday talk about maybe another $500 million, although a lot of variability around that number they pointed to. And obviously their book is different than yours, but any thoughts if conditions stay where they are now on additional reserve boosts? And then just related to that, the outlook for additional reserve release in the rest of the portfolio given, as you mentioned, trends continue to be strong or even improve in some areas. Paul Donofrio : Sure. Look, in terms of reserve build, we think the reserves we have right now are the right reserves for our portfolio. Built in releases in the future of going to be based upon how companies adapt to the level and duration of low oil prices as well as our net charge-offs and we think companies are adapting. In terms of reserve releases, we would expect releases in Consumer, but at a slower pace than we've seen in the past as we run off the legacy portfolio and depended upon the real estate market. Brian Moynihan : Consumer releases would likely go to offset any builds in commercial. Matt O'Connor: Okay. That's helpful. And then just separately, kind of big picture from a regulatory point of view if I look back to last year, you've had some steps forward, some steps backwards. Obviously had to resubmit on CCAR and that was a net positive once you got the results back. You got the approval for the extra 1% buyback which I think symbolically a lot of investors view and I view as positive. You've got the living will issue that came up yesterday for you and a number of others. Just at a very high level, maybe give us an update on how you are feeling from the regulatory point of view and where the areas are that you feel like you still need to improve. Brian Moynihan : I think from a global perspective we continue to implement all the rules and regulations of change over the last few years. And importantly, Volcker was an implementation mid-this year. And all lot of the hard work has been done if you think about LCR, SLR, the core Basel rules and the changes. We absorbed the advanced increases over the last year and now we're above the 10% advanced including the $100 billion or more of RWA for the commercial assets and the off risk of capital of $40- billion-odd. And so, we've absorbed a lot of that into the run rate and I think we're now to the point of fine-tuning the Company around the rules and regulations and continue optimizing it. And I think that \u2013 we've obviously submitted the CCAR work. We did a tremendous amount of work just on the expense submitted the CCAR work. We did a tremendous amount of work just on the expense side. That was another $40 million of incremental expense this quarter in the first quarter to continue to get us using third parties to continue to make sure we kept our run rate at best-in-class. And so that's in and being reviewed as we speak. And then we've got obviously, as you spoke about, the continuation of finishing up the resolution plan, which we \u2013 has probably spent at least $0.5 billion on external parties to help us with and a lot of internal work. And that's all been in the run rate as we speak and ultimately provide relief as we get through it. So I think overall you've seen us implement most of the rules and optimize the Company. We need to continue to do that. That ought to provide some RWA opportunities in the future, but it continues to take time. But we've \u2013 I think we're in pretty good shape and now the question is just to finish up a couple of these key tasks on the resolution plan that you can see. Unprecedented transparency \u2013 you've got the same letter I got, so you know exactly what we have to do, and we'll get it done. Paul Donofrio : If I could just have maybe two thoughts. One, this is not an episodic activity for us. This is being [Audio Dip] and meeting the standards under the regulations. That's one. Two is it's not a group of people who are doing this. It's everybody in the Company. It's \u2013 we have a significant \u2013 it's really being led in many ways by the line of business. We've got involvement from all of the support functions, so it's become part of the culture of the Company to get to the right standards across all the regulations. Operator : And we can take our next question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Betsy Graseck : Hey, good morning. Brian Moynihan : Good morning, Betsy. Paul Donofrio : Good morning, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : Hey, couple of questions. One is on the quality of the book. You went through and reminded us how much you've improved the quality of book in the Consumer. Could you speak to that in the commercial as well, ex-energy? And then give us a sense as to whether or not you think that's embedded in the CCAR results. I'm just trying to get an understanding of whether or not you think that RWA hit that you had to take could potentially come down as commercial rolls through? Paul Donofrio : So outside of \u2013 on the commercial side, outside of energy and metals and mining, we don't see issues with credit quality. We're obviously watching very carefully, but it feels very good outside of those two sectors. What was the second part of your question? Brian Moynihan : Its on the CCAR results. Paul Donofrio : Oh, yes, yes, absolutely. Look, if you look at our CCAR results, either on an absolute basis or on a comparative basis, you can see what a third-party, the Fed, thinks our losses would be. You're going to see that again in a few months. And I think you can really see, when you look at those results, how much we've improved the credit quality of Company of both \u2013 across both Consumer and Commercial. Betsy Graseck : Do you think that can help in the buyback ask as you go through \u2013 it's not just a question about this year but just over time? Brian Moynihan : Over time, Betsy, our view is that we can grow the Company and grow it responsibly as we talk about. So there's opportunities for growth and that's \u2013 on the Consumer segment a lot of questions we get is how can you grow and keep your credit discipline? You must be changing. You can see that this stuff coming on today is as strong as anything we put on and the Commercial you should assume is the same. And so there is still plenty of opportunity for us to grow, which is just good for earnings and prospects. When you flip it to the other side of it, yes, our job from the management team was to set this Company up to \u2013 it would never have the kind of risk embedded in it that would lead us to difficult times and a real recession, leave alone the CCAR analysis. And as you see the CCAR analysis over time, you see our loss content continue to come down and that should serve us in good stead to be able to take out capital over time, as you said. And if you think about in the Commercial book, it's \u2013 things like commercial real estate, we have been very disciplined and what we inherited through all the deals and development loans \u2013 all that stuff is really nonexistent at any consequence, so we feel very good about the Commercial book. Betsy Graseck : Okay, and then just separately, you talked a bit about the mobile user increase. And I just wanted to get your sense as to the opportunity from here. You recently launched the new app with mobile pay, which you've been doing internally but now you can do externally. Brian Moynihan : Right. Betsy Graseck : Could you give us how that's resonating with clients? Is there an opportunity set here for you and are you going to market it a little bit more aggressively going forward? Brian Moynihan : So let's \u2013 just framing from the overall top. Last year this quarter we had 17 million mobile users; this year we have 19.5 million. And as Paul said, there was an interesting point that the nominal rate of growth this quarter was one of the highest we've ever had. So even though smart phones have penetrated, you think you've kind of penetrated the customer base, it's still growing fast, so that's number one. And then as I said earlier, Betsy, and you've followed our Company for a long time, you might \u2013 you would've seen a plateauing in the online \u2013 the computer-based banking, for lack of a better term, people coming in through BankofAmerica.com. And that now is growing as fast nominally or faster mobile which means people are also using both sides. And so that's one thing. So the core activity is growing. And if you look at the activity in the core customer base from card usage \u2013 both that in credit card usage up 4%-plus year-over-year, and that's good. The online mobile part of the spend is now up to 20% of the spend and it's growing 15% per year versus the 4%, 4.5% growth on the total. So that's tremendous. Then if you get in the wallet categories, just to give you a sense, just in the last week the growth rates in enrolled cards was 12% week to week growth in terms of volume enrolled, 100,000-odd cards came on. The payment usage was up 3% week over week, so you see this phenomenal growth rate. If you annualized that out, that's a weekly growth rate and it ebbs and flows with holidays and everything else, but think about that. And you see that usage going up, but the mobile wallet payments are still less than 0.2% of the total payments made with plastic at Bank of America. So you still have lots of opportunity to convert activity to a platform which is more convenient for the customer. And then the other thing we've \u2013 and then a part of that you talk about is the new consortium to build a new P2P deployment for the banking system. We're up and operating that. We still have a few more months before the rest of the colleagues in the consortium get up and then we'll start to push that out in the market heavily. I think it's a tremendous improvement over what we have today, even though we have a fair amount of volume on it today through clearXchange and that was an effort to get us all together so we could have a very interoperable payment network. We've got the Visa Checkout work that's going on where we're preloading customers' cards in their wallet. We're about, as best we can tell, 13%, 14% of all the spend in Visa Checkout today and we've got 1 million-plus cards; we'll drive that forward. And if you put that altogether you're seeing tremendous volume off of all these mechanisms. And in the month of March, to give you an example, we had almost $60 billion of payments off the computer-based platform and about $20 billion off the mobile-based platform. So think about the size of that. Now given all that, we still sent out about $8 billion of cash out of our ATMs in the month of March on \u2013 that's $0.25 billion a day or more. So it's still \u2013 you have to have all the capabilities and that's what we're building towards. And going back to I think Jim's question earlier, the cost structure keeps moving in your favor as you keep driving this activity through. Betsy Graseck : I mean eventually you've got an elimination of checks and some of your bill pay costs potentially go down as well, I would assume? Brian Moynihan : Yes, eventually is always an operative word. Even today I think there's about a quarter million checks a day, people take a picture of them and send them in on their mobile phones and that didn't exist three years ago. But there's still a quarter million of them that would have to go way, so it will be a while. Betsy Graseck : Okay, but that's in line with expectations to bring down the consumer expense ratio? I mean, is that really the driver of getting the consumer expense ratio down is the backend on the payments piece? Brian Moynihan : Yes, it's everything about payments : processing, fraud losses, discussions with the customers about the payment \u2013 the multiple payment faculties that they could use and how they interface. And so, it has been a huge driver. Remember we went from 6,100 branches down to 4,600 or whatever today. And the customer base has increased by 10% and the volume of deposits is up by I think 30% to 40% and checking deposits are up dramatically. So I think year-over-year checking deposits were up 8% or 10% I think, Lee, right? Something like that. So the activity is level is growing up on a smaller and smaller base. And that cost structure in retail is driven by two things, the people, which we're increasing sales in relationship management content, and the physical plant. And you're absolutely right, driving all that out \u2013 near as we can tell, we spend about $1 billion a year just moving cash around in our company. So less cash moving around saves us money. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And just remind us what your goal is to get the consumer expense ratio to? Brian Moynihan : The goal is to have it keep going down every day, week, month, quarter. And I think, Betsy, with all these things you've got to be careful about letting my consumer colleagues think they are doing too good a job. So I keep putting pressure on them, so I'm not going to give them a goal that they think they've achieved something. Betsy Graseck : All right. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from John McDonald with Berstein. John McDonald : Hi, good morning. I was wondering about \u2013 on the net interest income side if you could talk a little bit about, Paul, what kind of outlook we should think about for the core net interest income. That was 10.6 this quarter. If rates are relatively stable and we don't see any hike for a while, how should that trend with all the puts and takes? Paul Donofrio : Sure. So look, we're hesitant to give guidance. Given the volatility rate that we've experienced, guidance has not been that helpful, in my opinion, but I'll give you a couple of thoughts, 10.6, if you think about maybe as a launching off point, given some of the seasonal NII gains we had in Q1 I think a more reasonable launch point would be more like 10.5. Then you go to the second quarter, we've obviously got to deal with lower long-term rates. Second quarter is always a little bit seasonally lower for us. So there's some \u2013 progress there is going to be challenged. But I think as you head to the third quarter and fourth quarter, when you consider what we're \u2013 think we can do on deposit growth and loan growth, and if rates follow the path along the forward curve, we would expect to make progress in the latter half of the year. John McDonald : Okay, and you do get a day count help modest in the second quarter from the first, right? Doesn't that help? Paul Donofrio : It's a leap year, so I think it's normally down 2, but now it's down 1, or\u2026 John McDonald : Kind of maybe right. Paul Donofrio : Flat, yes. John McDonald : Going into the second. Okay. And then just on trading, there was a quote in the media from you this morning, Paul, saying March felt better in certain areas. Could you just give us a little color on what changed in March on the trading front? What got better? Has that carried over a little bit into April? And how are you thinking about the Brexit vote from a risk and revenue impact potentially as that comes up this spring? Paul Donofrio : Sure. So March felt, I think, a lot better than certainly January and February. And April it's really too early, but April feels, at least is starting out, like it's more like March than it is like January and February. In terms of Brexit, we are focused on our clients and customers. They are going to need \u2013 there's going to be volatility potentially around the vote and around any changes after the vote. And we're working very closely with our customers to address how they need to manage their risk. From our own Company perspective, we are \u2013 we're going to listen. It's a UK \u2013 it's the UK's decision. We're going to \u2013 after we find out what the decision is and understand it, then I think we will react to it and do what we think is in the best interest of our customers and clients and shareholders and other constituencies. John McDonald : Okay, thank you. And in terms of March, what \u2013 could you just \u2013 any color on what got better? What felt better? Which areas of the business? Could you help on that? Paul Donofrio : No, I wouldn't say \u2013 look, I think you heard from competitors that Asia was a little better in March. We're stronger in the U.S. than we are in Asia. We have a significant business there, but \u2013 so there was some improvement out there. But, no, I wouldn't have any more specifics than that. John McDonald : Okay, thanks. Operator : Our next question will come from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Glenn Schorr : Hi, thanks very much. On slide 12 you noted your asset sensitivity increased a bunch from the prior quarter. You mentioned driven by the drop in long end rates. Could you talk through how that actually works. And then how much of the $6 billion is short end versus long end? Paul Donofrio : Sure. 40% of the $6 billion is going to come from an increase in short end rates and then the other 60% is split equally between FAS 91 and reinvestment at longer term rates. The FAS 91 piece is relatively straightforward. I mean we had $1.2 billion decline in Q1 because interest rates went down 50 basis points. We\u2019re going to retrace that if they go back up. Glenn Schorr : Separate one. If you look at the ROA full year-on-year, it's a large amount on a percentage basis from 59% down to 50%. I'm just curious, I wouldn't think weak capital markets in the quarter was the big driver, but I guess the question is what's the big driver of it. And are the new business you are putting on coming in at higher ROA so we should expect that to rise from here, assuming not so crazy markets? Paul Donofrio : Look, if you think about our ROA and you adjust for FAS 91 market-related NII adjustments and retirement-eligible expenses, you're going to get into the mid-70s. And then if you give us some credit for the progress we've made in LAS over the last few years and continue with that progress, you're going to get even higher. From there it's about growing loans \u2013 growing deposits, growing loans, putting on, like you said, assets that are accretive to what we have on the books right now. And, importantly, continuing to grind and work on expenses. And so, that's what we've got to do. Glenn Schorr : Okay. One last tiny one is Wealth Management margins increased a couple hundred basis points quarter-on-quarter. 500 year-on-year without the help of revenues. Expenses were down a bunch. You mentioned the $100 million roll off of the previous amortized retention awards. What's the rest of the expense saves inside Wealth Management? It's pretty good in a world that didn't have much revenue. Paul Donofrio : It's compensation related given the fact that revenue was a little weak because of the volatile markets. That's not to say we're not working on bringing down costs in that segment as well, but specifically to answer your question in Q1, that's what drove it. Glenn Schorr : Is that nonproduction expenses, meaning usually the comp stuff goes hand-in-hand with revenues? Brian Moynihan : Yes, it's \u2013 they are working on all the elements expense, so you've got that right. But also remember as the NII increases there's not as much expense attached to that. So that's one of the operating leverage points in wealth management that we were losing a lot last year that we're going to get back as short-term rates rise because they are a heavy deposit business. Remember, they alone are $260 billion of deposits in Wealth Management, which those deposits and loans continue to grow which continues to produce more core NII. As well as what everybody thinks of as being a large Investment Management trust fee type company. But they are a big bank and the loans grow and that's going to drive that up and that is marginally more profitable for the shareholder. Glenn Schorr : Okay, perfect. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Paul Miller with FBR & Company. Paul Miller : Hey, thank you very much, guys. On the legacy asset, on the \u2013 you lowered your loans from 103,000 to 88,000 on the high touch servicing or default servicing. How much of that was sold or are you guys just working through the book? Paul Donofrio : I would classify it as little to very little sold this quarter. It's just working service loans \u2013 delinquent service loans down. Paul Miller : Just working it down? And has \u2013 the new stuff coming in, is that still a material amount or it has that been \u2013 is that mainly done? Like you're not really getting a lot of new stuff coming into this bucket? Brian Moynihan : Very little from any production that was done after the crisis, Paul, as you could expect. So they're delinquency statistics. So really you still have modifications that \u2013 the re-modification work going on because people have had modifications for years. Some portion of them go back in the situation and then you have just the normal flow. But that number keeps working itself down and, based on the quality of our portfolio, should come down even significant to where it is. This is a grind now. This is just working through \u2013 if some were involved in litigation take time. It's just a grind to work them out now. Paul Miller : And then you said in the quarter \u2013 and you disclosed this a very, very clearly \u2013 that it was about $700 million on this. Where can we \u2013 can this be cut in half by the end of the year? When does this really become immaterial do you think? Brian Moynihan : Well, as we've told you, our target \u2013 our next weigh station on improving this thing is $500 million at the end of the year and we're well on our way to get there, Paul. But your experienced in this business. That is not an acceptable number, but I just need to keep them tracking it down. What's interesting, and if you look at the headcount we show you and stuff, what is changing is they're headcount down is at 1900 or something like that, 1900 at the end of the quarter so it's come down from a high of 58000 internal people plus external contractors dramatically. Now we've got to get some of the harder costs out, meaning the systems and technology that was overbuilt for $12 million servicing portfolio, the real estate, and that takes a little harder work. So we're grinding all that out. So say $700 million and change to $500 million and change and ultimately we've got to get it down to significantly below that $500 million to make it makes sense as a servicing. I think it's okay, but to actually be an effective servicing platform we should drive it down. Your point about immateriality is something \u2013 this is becoming less and less of an event to us. And so what we've got to execute on \u2013 it's not going to have the impact of when we had $3.1 billion of quarterly costs a few years. Paul Donofrio : $1.4 million of 60 plus day delinquent loan service. Brian Moynihan : So $500 million by year end, that's our next goal, and then when we get there we'll give you another one. But we're just \u2013 like I said earlier to Betsy on the Consumer side, we've got to keep moving this in the right direction and we have an idea where we'll get to, but we want to make sure we get the first piece out, it's $1 billion a year. Paul Miller : Okay, guys. Guys, thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim. Eric Wasserstrom : Thanks very much. If I could just refer back to slide 16 for a moment. There's been a lot of debate about the dynamics in the auto lending market, about deterioration in underwriting and the risks of large amounts of used cars coming off of lease. Could you give us any granularity about what you are seeing in lending across the FICO spectrum and how you are anticipating that residual issue to play out? Paul Donofrio : Sure. Look, this is some perspective. We're maintaining our market share in auto lending, but we're very focused on originating prime and super prime loans. Average FICO score, as you can see on the page, of 78 and debt to income ratios are at all-time lows. Again, we're not following the market from a structuring standpoint to the longer tenors. 90% of our loans are 73 months or lower, so that's our strategy. And I think if we stick to that, we'll be fine. We did pull forward from \u2013 we had an opportunity this quarter to get more flow. We had planned to do that in later quarters. We pulled that volume to this quarter and we'll evaluate it in future quarters. And you asked a question about residual values and the volume of cars sold and what happens. We also, as part of our stress testing of our \u2013 stress testing our portfolios, internal stress testing and also for the CCAR DFAST work, we stress the collection \u2013 the recognized collection value of cars down 40% and it's not \u2013 it'd obviously have more losses, why wouldn't you? But what really controls your losses is the quality portfolio and what runs through that calculation. And that number is, because of the high quality is very low. So we test that question you're asking which is what happens if residual values or used car values continue to \u2013 fell dramatically in a recessionary environment or something and that's one of the things we test, and it's not a big number. Eric Wasserstrom : Right, and when you say that you pulled forward some flow, what do you mean by that? Paul Donofrio : We had the opportunity \u2013 we have relationships where \u2013 on the flow side and when we see opportunities we can pull some of that in. Originations come through the branch, they come online and they come through our relationships with financial institutions who have relationships with dealers. Brian Moynihan : And our relationship with dealers also. Paul Donofrio : Yes, our relationship with dealers. So every once in a while we'll see an opportunity to add some balances and if it's within our underwriting standards we'll consider it. Eric Wasserstrom : And that was primarily on the indirect side? Paul Donofrio : Yes. Eric Wasserstrom : Okay. Thanks very much for the clarity. Operator : Our next question from Mike Mayo with CLSA. Mike Mayo : Hi, my short question is when will the return on equity go into the double-digit range? Look, you have a good franchise and balance sheet. You're showing growth in loans, deposits, online banking, other areas. And you're showing lower, better expenses, branches, headcount, risk but it's not adding up. I mean your stock is 15% below tangible book value and this was yet one more quarter of mid-single-digit ROEs and worse than peer efficiency. So my question is why is Bank of America less efficient than peer? And it's tough on the outside to know because you have $2 billion of expenses in Other that's not allocated to the business lines. What is your Plan B if rates don't go up and when will the ROE go into the double-digits? Paul Donofrio : Well, hi, Mike. Thank you. So I guess I would start by again \u2013 just so everybody understands the facts \u2013 we \u2013 if you adjust for FAS 91 and FAS 123, our return on tangible common equity would be roughly 8.5%. And again, as I said before, we've made a lot of progress in LAS. And if you give us any credit for the progress for the progress we think we're going to make in the future, we're going to be able to take that 8.5% even further. We've made, I think \u2013 so the key is we've got to continue to make progress on expenses and, again, I think we've demonstrated that we can do that. If you look just year-over- year, expenses are down $1 billion or 6%. If you go back to Q1, Q1 2011, we've taken quarterly expenses down, core quarterly expenses down $3.5 billion, so that's a $14 billion run rate. We've got to continue to do that. If you look this quarter at our Consumer and GWIM segments, you can see the operating leverage. If you look at the whole Company and you back off FAS91, you can see the operating leverage. So we've just got to continue to work on expenses. We're not sitting around waiting for rates to go up. It would help if they did, and that's what we're focused on. Mike Mayo : All right, if I can follow-up. Despite all the progress that you've made \u2013 and you talked about the LAS expenses, you can talk about New BAC, you can talk about the quarterly expense rate since 2011. But your core EPS is still $0.33 this quarter, and it was a weak \u2013 tough quarter, tough environment, but it still in that $0.35 range. So despite all those expense savings we're not seeing it in the core EPS number that's still around $0.35. So where did all those expense savings go or is this going to come through in future quarters? And I know I've asked this question on many earnings calls and also thank you, Bank of America, for having that \u2013 and Brian for having that opening letter from the lead director in the annual report. Jack Bovender says that he wants to engage more with investors. And so I do hope that he takes my questions at the annual meeting to engage a little bit more because I've asked this so many times. I still don't feel like I have an answer that I understand, so just one more try at it, Paul. Just where are these expense savings going if EPS is still in the same range? Paul Donofrio : So, they're going \u2013 you sort of have identified the opportunity that we have in a different market environment. It's a judgment I think we have to make. But a portion of these savings are going to increase growth in the future. A portion are going to the bottom line. That's the lever we can pull over an extended period of time to adjust for the market environment. We've proven we can get the expenses out. If we wanted them all to drop to the bottom line we could do that, but we need to invest in growth at the same time and we've got to balance that. Mike Mayo : So, no new BAC coming up or anything like that? It's just \u2013 as I guess, Brian, you've said, you grind it out. It's just \u2013 it would be nice to see more of the progression. Is it \u2013 do you think it's a 2016 event? A 2017 event? Or we just \u2013 when rates go up we'll see more of it? Brian Moynihan : Look in terms we are focused on driving down expenses every day, every quarter, every week. You can call it anything you want. We've got a lot of focus on this and I think you're going to continue to see progress. Our operating leverage on an adjusted basis this quarter was meaningful. You can see it if you adjust the FAS 91, revenue down 3%, expenses down 6%. We're getting the operating leverage. Look at the GWIM segment, look at the Consumer segment. We are focused on it. Mike Mayo : All right. Thank you Paul. Operator : Our next question is from Steven Chubak with Nomura. Please go ahead. Steven Chubak : Hi good morning. So, I had a follow-up to Glenn's earlier question on the Wealth Management margin. I just want to get a sense as to whether we should be thinking about that 26% margin that we saw in the quarter as a good jumping off point, just given some of the tailwinds you had spoken to, whether it be the higher-margin NII growth and the absence of the legacy Merrill awards. And I suppose as it relates to that, are preparation efforts for things such as DoL compliance potentially going to weigh on the margin in future quarters? Brian Moynihan : A couple things with that. The 26% \u2013 if you think back across the last year when we discussed this, we had the ATP piece. And so a chunk of that is that, the other chunk is good expense management. I said earlier the margin net interest income stabilizing, improving. They been growing the balances now. It's more stable. So I think it is a good starting point. It will \u2013 in some cases you would hope that it wouldn't go up a lot because that would mean asset management fees and other things are growing, which attach more compensation, less marginal profit, which will be good news, because the overall profit will grow better. But you should assume that that\u2019s a level we should hold on to if in a relatively stable environment as we see this quarter starting out at. When you go to the fiduciary, we've been working on that, obviously. Just because it's the final rule and it came out recently we've been working on it. So I don\u2019t think \u2013 I think to the extent there's cost embedded in that, a lot of it's in the run rate and it will be marginally in the run rate for the next few quarters. It's not a hugely substantial cost and if you even \u2013 look, we've spent a lot of time educating our teammates about doing it. There are operational cost, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s material in the grand scheme of thing. Paul Donofrio : Brian I\u2019ll just add a little bit to that. I think from the very beginning we supported the fundamental objectives of the Department of Labor. And if you look at our goals based strategy, it delivers a lot of what they are getting at with that rule in terms of the best interest standard. Our Merrill Lynch One advisory platform, which we successfully completed the transition of a lot of clients this quarter. That's a great example of how we've been up front to create an experience that is really transparent, single fee schedule, etc. That's a significant investment. And we're guessing that that investment is really going to pay off here in terms of implementing this rule. If you look at roughly the $2 trillion of GUM [ph] client assets we have outside of deposits and loans, we think the Department of Labor will probably impact less than 10% of that. And certainly given the implementation schedule we wouldn't expect to see much of an impact, if any impact, in 2016 and as we digest the rules we'll just have to evaluate how it's going to affect out years. Steven Chubak : Okay. So it sounds as though a lot of the incremental expense is already in the run rate and that you don't anticipate much revenue disruption based on the final rule as written? Paul Donofrio : Yes that\u2019s correct. Steven Chubak : Okay. Got it. And maybe just focusing on the expense base within Global Markets. Was certainly pleased to see the absolute level of dollar expense was, from what I could tell, the lowest level that we've seen over the last five years. So clearly some of the efforts that you highlighted to right size the cost base have borne fruit. And as we think about the expense trajectory for this business, what should we expect in an environment where the trading revenues are relatively stable or consistent with what we saw in the most recent quarter? Is that $2.4 billion [ph] a reasonable run rate expectation? Paul Donofrio : We\u2019re going to continue like every other segment. We\u2019re going to continue to work on bringing our cost down in this segment as well. I think there's lots of things we can do from an operational standpoint to improve profitability over the medium and long term and we're focused on that. You're right, here compensation expenses are significant and they are going to be consistent with the revenue performance. I think we were disciplined this quarter in terms of our compensation expense and you saw that in the numbers. Brian Moynihan : We\u2019ve been adjusting as you read about in the press, there is a \u2013 it's not in the run rate yet, it comes in next quarter because it happened mid-March. They made major adjustments in size of platform in mid-March. I'll give you an example. We have equity sales people year-over-year down 60 or 70 on base of despite down 15%, 20% at least. So fab in that business continues to reposition. Bernie and Jim continue on the fixed income side so they made some major adjustments to headcount. So we\u2019ll hold it down here. You want this expense to go up because that means the revenue has gone back up. So you've got to be careful. But the fundamental operating platform has embedded in the run rate cost actually continue to develop a systems architecture, continue to drive the compliance of Volcker and all that stuff as you go in the run rate. So the chances of the non-compensation related expenses moving a lot is not the big deal and the question is just how do you incrementally keep management down. Paul Donofrio : The other thing to remember just in this quarter, I would just point out again, that we did have a little bit of help from litigation. We had a reversal of a prior matter. It helped on the expense line. Steven Chubak : Okay. And can you quantify how much of a benefit that provided, Paul? Paul Donofrio : We don\u2019t generally comment on those sorts of things. It was going for the $100 million. Steven Chubak : Okay, got it. And then just one more final one for me, just on the investment banking side. You talked about stability in March continuing into April on the trading business. One of your competitors talked about actually seeing some improving trends in the capital raising environment in April versus what was clearly a challenging quarter in 1Q. I didn't know if you were seeing some improvement on the capital raising side as well. And if you can give us an update just in terms of backlogs in some of the other pockets like M&A, that would be helpful. Paul Donofrio : As you might imagine, the pipeline is \u2013 looks great because everybody \u2013 people need to transact, they just haven\u2019t \u2013 they just didn\u2019t do it in the first quarter. So it\u2019s building up in periods where there's volatility like this, the best thing our bankers can do is to be in front of CEOs, Boards and CFOs. They are doing that. There is going to be \u2013 have to be financing activity at some point because clients need to finance them. And so our pipeline was good. I wouldn\u2019t necessarily say we\u2019ve seen any in the first few days of April we\u2019ve seen any dramatic increase in capital markets activity, but there is certainly lots of dialogue. The pipeline looks good again because I think there's a lot of pent-up demand there. Brian Moynihan : I think the simple thing to think about in the investment banking Capital Market side is the work is ready to go, we just \u2013 if we continue to see the stability, you will see it come through. And that\u2019s \u2013 our comments are really based on still \u2013 they\u2019re still stabilizing as we speak. And so, if that happens, you expect to see it start pulling through and it would be up from the quarter, quarter-over-quarter. But there are still a few more weeks of stability that you have to see for people to actually pull the trigger on financings and stuff. Paul Donofrio : Obvious, the markets right now are stable. People can finance if they want to. I think it\u2019s just a question, as Brian said, of CEOs and Boards just making sure that the stability we\u2019re seeing right now is something that they can count on as they go to market. Operator : And we can take our next question from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Ken Usdin : Thanks. Good morning. Brian, right at the outset you said that there has really been no meaningful change in the customer base activity. And then the following on your comments about stable capital markets, you are growing the core loan book now double-digits still, 11%. I\u2019m just wondering how much of that is the environment holding up. How much of that is still the spigot opening from reasonable growth? And just your outlook in terms of customer behavior on the lending side? Brian Moynihan : The other thing, Ken, is that you have to remember that for a long period of time we were fighting the runoff of the non-core assets, which are now small enough that we could actually overcome them. So there are a lot of quarters where the core activity was growing but you couldn\u2019t find it because \u2013 if you look at the slide you can see the All Other, which is the investment portfolio, really mortgages and then the LAS assets are now small enough so that the quarter-to-quarter runoff. But I think it\u2019s solid across-the-board. I think that in the segments we focus in on the Consumer side, prime, super prime, there\u2019s strong activity. Mortgages, you could see the origination volumes this quarter were solid. I think if you think of home equity has kicked back up a little bit again because people see home equity in their house. The auto businesses strong, but it will ebb and flow with how many units get sold ultimately because that\u2019s the nature of the business. Although I think we can gain share there because our share on our direct-to-consumer business was very low. We didn\u2019t even do it two years ago and now we\u2019re up to, I don\u2019t know, $0.5 billion or more a quarter. So I think from a consumer side, the card business, because we\u2019ve now sold through all the portfolios we have to sell, I think you should see stable and start to see better year-over-year comparables than we\u2019ve had the last several years. Obviously last big portfolio went out in the fourth quarter, and so I think we feel good. If you look at the online customers, the creditworthy customers that we deal with are there to borrow and we\u2019re lending to them. And if you go on the Commercial side, as Paul said earlier, I think you would expect us the CRE \u2013 we slowed \u2013 we want to be careful in CRE, so we are doing very fundamentally structured loans. But in C&I, and a nice \u2013 business banking, not a huge business for us, frankly, but they finally are making it through their runoff and that\u2019s good. And so I think across all those businesses you should see \u2013 it may not grow as fast as normally it has. Two years ago we had the international book grow and corporate \u2013 we slowed that down based on our judgments about risk. And so I think it\u2019s a pretty balanced growth. And so the question always is do you have to compromise your credit standards to grow? No, we don\u2019t because you can see that. And then secondly, is there opportunity to actually get growth? And the answer is yes. But \u2013 and that\u2019s just good, hard work. Ken Usdin : Yes, Brian, to that last point, how much opportunity actually, without pointing to compromising, but how much more spigot opening can you still do, to your point about the post crisis, the tightening up internally? Are you still under lent, if at all. Or you still have to be somewhat careful about where we are in this stage of the economic cycle being that we are seven-plus years into an expansion? Brian Moynihan : We have to be careful and that\u2019s what I think we wanted to show you some of the \u2013 there are two \u2013 three basic principles that you have to follow. One is, we had to balance the portfolios between Commercial and Consumer. Second, we had to get the Consumer to secured portfolios dominating versus unsecured both credit card \u2013 now the loans really put us behind \u2013 in a tough situation last time. And then, third, you\u2019ve got to maintain your individual quality of underwriting. Consumer is more formulaic and Commercial more deal selection and customer selection. But if you look at it \u2013 I\u2019ll just give you the simplest way to think about this. We have moved probably from 8 out of 10 mortgage holders who are absolutely within our credit box, absolutely we do business with, getting their mortgage somewhere else to maybe 7. So we\u2019ve still got 7 more to go without talking about expanding the credit parameters in our mortgage business one iota. So think of that as a demonstration point that you can go over and over again. So there is plenty of market share out there. And then one of the things, Ken, we\u2019re looking at is we look across our 90-odd markets in the United States. There are areas where we have tremendous opportunity to expand our market share where the franchise just wasn\u2019t balanced. Some areas of franchise, the wealth management business is a high percentage; in some places, it\u2019s low. The middle-market business is very high market \u2013 very strong, good market shares in certain markets and a third of that in other markets. And so, where we\u2019re deploying these people is also based on our view of which market. So it\u2019s going into that market, hiring talent, using this massive customer capability we have to go drive it. Again, target the exact customers we want. So, even on a geographic basis, whether it\u2019s the deposit business and expanding in some of those markets, but also in the commercial lending business and \u2013 otherwise there\u2019s opportunities without compromising credit. Paul Donofrio : As Brian said, that\u2019s where those added sales professionals are going. They\u2019re going to markets where we think we have synergies across commercial, GWIM and Consumer. Ken Usdin : Okay, got it. So in some \u2013 you think this 10% plus primary lending is still achievable? That\u2019s what it sounds like from what you\u2019re saying. Brian Moynihan : Well, I think we\u2019ve been telling people to focus more on mid-single-digits type of numbers in a given 2% growth \u2013 1.5%, 2% growth economy as opposed to 10%. So \u2013 but the core business is growing faster and then we\u2019re still running off, but we\u2019ve told people to focus in at that level. Ken Usdin : Okay. Understood. Thanks, guys. Operator : Our next question is from Nancy Bush with NAB Research. Brian Moynihan : Good morning, Nancy. Nancy Bush : Good morning. Brian, I think we\u2019ve all over the last few years been trying to find banking normal and it\u2019s proving hard to find. And it kind of has begun to strike some of us that maybe first quarter \u2013 what we saw in the first quarter in terms of volatility and continued low rates, etc., etc., is banking normal, at least for the foreseeable future. And under that scenario, if you believe that, would you \u2013 have you begun to look at \u2013 take a second look at your businesses again? And will there be any sort of reallocation of capital going forward and are there businesses you might want to exit? Brian Moynihan : I\u2019m not sure you can consider first-quarter banking normal in the sense that we still have extra costs we\u2019ve got a get out of here, Nancy, that we continue to work down. Litigation was elevated in the quarter from more the normalized level that we feel we can achieve and things like that. But leave that aside. The basic principle is we continuously look at the franchise to see about optimization. So generally when people ask that question they are thinking about a couple different areas. One is the markets area. We show you the markets. Profitability returns in this business. But if you get into the supplement you\u2019ll see you can never call a markets business an annuity business. But what drives our business is really a connection between the issuer clients, the commercial borrowers and commercial clients and the investor clients that we serve. And to do that \u2013 in our Wealth Management business, because that\u2019s a group of people that rely on the research platform. If you look, the interconnectedness of that is massive and \u2013 whether it\u2019s by us getting out of proprietary trading and Volcker and things like that, the whole \u2013 the real business is driven at that. And so, if you \u2013 we\u2019ve taken the balance sheet from implying at the time of Merrill, probably nearly to $800 billion or more, maybe closer to $1 trillion down to $500 billion and the revenues have stabilized and I think that\u2019s a good place for us to be. Number one research plant in the world. Number one in the U.S. this year. The ability to use it in wealth management, the ability to use it to inform our corporate customers. So, we look at how we pare away things and look at it \u2013 so in the international business we\u2019ve pared back \u2013 there was 1,200 \u2013 I don\u2019t know, 800 to 1,200 people that were downsized in markets and banking in the first quarter. So we keep \u2013 it\u2019s not in or out, it\u2019s more how do you keep paring it back. And so, if you look across there, we always look at that question. We continue to look at it, but right now we really like the franchise and the connectivity between the franchise of all the different elements, focused on markets, focused on wealth management, focused on the core business. And I think now the question is with low rates, we just have to grind the cost down and that\u2019s going to come out of really all the pieces and \u2013 well, for a while, it was \u2013 you could go at it at a fairly high level and drive it. Now it\u2019s really incrementally idea by idea and taking it out and that\u2019s why you see that constant improvement. Improvement of core costs of $2 billion run rate first quarter last year to first quarter this year is not \u2013 is working at it. It just takes more time because 130 million square feet of real estate down to 80 million go into 70 million. There\u2019s a lot of work to get out of that real estate. Nancy Bush : Right. Just as an add-on and looking at costs in the consumer bank, and you look at your mobile penetration and how it\u2019s going up, etc., etc. Is there a magic number in terms of \u2013 mobile transactions, mobile penetration, just the whole use of mobile in your Company where I think you\u2019ve been a leader that will lead to sort of a step down in branches. Are we sort of on this threshold of being able to take branches down yet another however many? Brian Moynihan : Well, I think if you think of branches and think about it as offices as opposed to the historical notion of a place where you transact, the question of how many you have is going to be how many relationship managers you need and how many places they have to sit. And so, what we\u2019ve done is consolidated the branches to be even bigger. So the sheer number \u2013 so we added 6,100 or 4,600. Each year we\u2019ve repositioned 200 or 300 of them. But what we\u2019re doing is getting out of smaller branches and building into bigger branches. So we consolidated three into one and build up \u2013 that branch has in it U.S. trust people, Wealth Management people, small business salespeople. So what we\u2019re actually \u2013 if you think about it as a real estate question, the number is not as important as they are full and that they are marginally driving the profit. And you can get a lot of salespeople per square inch, a lot of customer activity per square inch, and that\u2019s where we\u2019re going. And so, you\u2019re going to see some of the new prototypes that we\u2019ve deployed. You can see in places like Denver where we\u2019re now on our third branch and we\u2019ll continue to build out that are much \u2013 look much more like a sales office than what people\u2019s vision of a traditional branch. But going to your earlier question, Nancy, I don\u2019t know where this stops and I\u2019m not \u2013 that\u2019s not saying I\u2019m trying to hide an answer that I have, it\u2019s just that if you and I were here last year, and we were, and you said 17 million mobile users, that\u2019s good penetration, it\u2019s 2 million more a year later. And as computer-based banking is up 1.5 million or something like that, which is kind of remarkable on top of that. So we don\u2019t know where this goes, but we\u2019re going to be pushing ahead, following our clients and making sure we stay with them. At the same time, our customer satisfaction scores are now reaching an all-time high, which means the way we\u2019re doing it works for them. And you\u2019ve given me your feedback about our customer focus and capabilities over the years, but they are back to the highest they\u2019ve ever been and that\u2019s, importantly, managing that transition carefully and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve got to do. Nancy Bush : Okay. Thank you. Paul Donofrio : I just want to echo a couple of thoughts the Brian said. I think the branches are going to become not a destination where people come to transact but destination where people come because they need a product or service because of something changing in their lives. They need to start saving for their kids\u2019 college or they need a new \u2013 they need a mortgage or they need a credit card. It\u2019s more about they are coming there because of some life event or because of some product or service they need, not for every day transaction banking. We\u2019ll still have the branches that can do that for people who prefer that, but I think over time people will recognize the convenience and safety of doing these things online, doing them electronic not from paper. And the branches will become \u2013 we\u2019re organizing our branches so that they become destinations for people who need help with their financial lives. Nancy Bush : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead. Marty Mosby : Thanks. Brian Moynihan : Hi, Marty. Marty Mosby : I wanted to focus on mortgage banking and the retention of those loans, more on the balance sheet than continuing to push them to the GSIBs. Is that regulatory driven or are you really looking for that higher retention rate because you\u2019re looking for some assets that have duration, so is that one of the better maybe option adjusted yields that you can get at this point? Brian Moynihan : Marty, you can come at this a fairly straightforward way which is we have $1.2 trillion in deposits and we have $900 billion in loans. And if we put our own mortgages on the balance sheet we know the quality, we know the customer and we know that the servicing cost ultimately will be a lot less of how we\u2019re doing it. If we buy third-party loans \u2013 so to extract the value of those deposits we\u2019ve got to invest in something. We invested substantially in treasuries. We have to \u2013 back to mortgages and mortgage-backed securities. And so the question is why by someone else\u2019s when you are producing your own? So it\u2019s really a very pragmatic view of \u2013 we want to control our destiny in mortgage going forward so that the customer we look in the eye and originate the mortgage with is the customers we service for, is the customer we have the asset quality with and there is no third-party involved. So it\u2019s more driven by us just getting to our own, controlling our own destiny. Marty Mosby : And a follow-up to that is if you look at the impact of that on the business segments you actually are increasing the portfolio by about 30%, which is showing that retention. However, if you look at all other, it\u2019s more than overkill swamping that growth. Brian Moynihan : Right. Marty Mosby : You had about a $45 billion reduction, and kind of getting back to Mike\u2019s question about where is the benefits going, just the reduction in All Other, that almost $50 billion of loans is over $1 billion worth of NII that is going away, whereas you are having to do and invest and spend money to generate the 30% growth in the business. So is the runoff still part of where some of the leakage is that we are hoping to get in all the improvements in growth that you\u2019re showing in the core? And when does that \u2013 what\u2019s left is about $100 billion, when is that finally done so that you wouldn\u2019t have that leakage anymore? Brian Moynihan : Well, the \u2013 we used to \u2013 there is an element that\u2019s just as \u2013 we used to book that retained piece in the central area. We stopped doing that. That\u2019s showing the changeover, so you\u2019ve got to think of it a little bit together. But \u2013 and it\u2019s consistent with our peers. Most people have their consumer businesses booked to loans they retain. We just didn\u2019t do that for years. But remember, those \u2013 you\u2019ve got to remember that you\u2019ve got to think of the whole balance sheet. You\u2019re looking at the loan category. The money comes out of center because of liquidity demands in the rules. It goes into treasuries and other securities which are not in that chart because they are not loans, mortgage-backed securities and treasuries and that still has a yield to it. Not as dollar-denominated as much as mortgages but has a yield to it. That has been driven more by the liquidity demands in LCR than it is by anything else, which is the centralized portfolio. We\u2019ve gone from $100 billion in liquidity four or five years ago to $500 billion, so that has a cost to it in that \u2013 in prior years that could have been invested in high-yielding assets, but not \u2013 mortgages don\u2019t count for liquidity. Marty Mosby : Got you. Thanks. Paul Donofrio : And again, look \u2013 the facts are we\u2019ve been growing overall, so year-over-year including those segments which, as you point off by our strategy are running off faster. We\u2019re still growing the overall balance sheet. Operator : And we take our last question as a follow-up from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Hi, it\u2019s a follow-up on mortgage. So I think one of your suppliers or one of your partners, PHH, mentioned that you were going to be pulling back some of the servicing to yourself. And I just wanted to understand did you have to do anything to build for that book of business or is this already something that\u2019s in your run rate on the expense side and we\u2019re going to be bringing in incremental revenues on the mortgage servicing side? Brian Moynihan : It\u2019s marginally \u2013 will be absorbed. If you think about it, the total number of loans is relatively small. The total \u2013 it will go on the platform of very little change. Betsy Graseck : Okay, and is this the beginning of pulling it all over? Brian Moynihan : I think \u2013 I would just say that we\u2019re trying to be consistent with our strategy of controlling our own destiny. Betsy Graseck : Okay. All right. That\u2019s great. Thank you. Operator : And it appears we have no further questions. Ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude today\u2019s Bank of America earnings announcement call. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect and have a great day. Brian Moynihan : Thank you.",

At this time all participants are in listen-only mode. Later you will have the opportunity to ask questions during the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please note this call is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Mr. Lee McEntire. Please go ahead. Lee McEntire : Good morning. Thanks to everybody on the phone as well as the webcast for joining us this morning for the second quarter 2016 results. Hopefully everybody\u2019s had a chance to review the earnings release documents that were available on our website. Before I turn the call over to Brian and Paul, let me remind you we may make some forward-looking statements. For further information on those, please refer to either our earnings release documents, our website or our SEC filings. So before Brian and Paul get into the results, just let me mention one housekeeping item. Please limit your questions to one per caller so that we can get to everyone, and you can circle back. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Brian Moynihan, our Chairman and CEO, for some opening comments; before Paul Donofrio, our CFO, goes through the details. Brian? Brian Moynihan : Thank you, Lee, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to review our second quarter results. I\u2019m beginning on slide two of the materials we sent to you. We reported solid earnings of $4.2 billion after tax, or $0.36 per diluted share, in what was certainly an eventful quarter for the markets from an overall macro perspective. This compares to $5.1 billion or $0.43 per share in the year-ago quarter. This quarter included negative market related NII adjustments that cost $0.05 per share and negative DVA that cost us another penny for a total of $0.06. That compares to a $0.03 benefit for EPS for both those items in the second quarter of 2015. Earnings neutralizing for the past 91 DVA for both periods improved from $0.40 per share to $0.42 per share on a year-over-year basis. Our results represent another quarter of solid progress in the strategies we have been executing. Those strategies are delivering more of the company\u2019s capabilities to each and every client we serve. At BAC, we focus on what we can control, and despite low rates and other macro events, we continue to focus on managing our risk, our costs and our delivery of quality products and customer service. In Q2, we grew loans $22 billion or approximately 2.5% versus last year, even as we sold a few portfolios during the year. All this growth was organic and consistent with our risk appetite. We also grew deposits more than $66 billion or 6% over that same time period, and we did so while maintaining disciplined deposit pricing. We also continued to transform our company in a digital way at all things and all businesses. For example, this quarter we crossed over 20 million active mobile users and continued to increase their use of digital channels for both transactions and buying more bank products. Active mobile banking customers logged into their accounts over 900 million times this quarter, depositing more than 25 million checks, with more than 20 million via mobile check deposits. They made over 25 million mobile bill payments, up 30% year-over-year, and made nearly 80 million transfers. Person to person, or P2P, payments continue to ramp up as well. While still a small component of the overall consumer payments this quarter, we had $6.7 billion in P2P payments this quarter. That is more than $13 billion year to date and is up 20% from last year. This channel is a valued channel for all our customers and made possible by the [indiscernible] investment we make. As we move to slide three, we have talked to you \u2013 a lot of you over the last several months including many of you on the phone today. I thought I\u2019d try to address some of the more common questions we get from those conversations by looking at our results \u2013 by looking at the income statement and the items therein. First, one of the core questions is what if rates stay lower for longer? Well, for bank management and for you as investors it would be easier if rates were to rise but that hasn\u2019t happened. So the question is can we grow earnings without rates improving? We believe we surely can. We can do that by continued success on things like expense management, by keeping NII stable to growing, stable and growing fees, and continue to manage risk well and hold down our credit costs. As you can see, revenue this quarter was $20.6 billion on an FTE basis. Adjusted for the negative impacts of market-related NII adjustments and DVA, that number is $21.8 billion. Adjusted for the same items in the year-ago quarter, the total was comparable. Now as we focus in on NII, Paul will take you through some of the changes this quarter later in the presentation. However, in summary, adjusted for market-related changes in both last year\u2019s second quarter and this year\u2019s second quarter, we grew NII by 400 million or 4% year-over-year. And that took place while the 10-year Treasury yield fell 86 basis points from last year on a spot basis. Going forward in a stable interest rate environment, we believe we can maintain NII around the second quarter 2016 level based on the current loan and deposit growth we see. And if rates rise, we would expect NII to grow. Another question relates to Global Markets business. That question is often asked how we need to change this business, especially the FICC area as many of our customers have. I want to hit this head on. First of all, fixed income a good business for us here at Bank of America. It is a business which benefits not only by its core activities but by being coupled with our massive global banking franchise that has leadership positions across the globe. Combined together, they generate a pretty steady billion dollars or so of quarterly investment banking fees. It\u2019s also an important part of our overall Global Markets platform, the platform which sits on top of the number one global research team for the past five years. In the second quarter, this business did well. Global Markets generated $3.7 billion in sales and trading revenue excluding DVA. Compared to the same period last year, that is up 12%. This year-over-year improvement is driven by FICC sales and trading, which is up 22%. Now think about that. Sales and trading revenue including DVA for this quarter is the highest second quarter we have experienced in five years and it led to one of the most profitable quarters for Global Markets we have seen in the past five years. Also the team served clients well during a period of difficult volatility. So clearly it remains a profitable important business for us to serve clients. We\u2019re proud of how the team supported their clients through the Brexit both in the periods of volatility related there too. Another question is getting clarity on how we\u2019re transforming the business on the fee lines. Noninterest revenue was $11.2 billion this quarter. Although modestly down from second quarter 2015, it was up nicely from the first quarter. There are a lot of the items that one through the various lines of fees. First with regard to consumer fees, we are largely done with the big card portfolio divestitures and branch divestitures. Both those impacted both card fees and banking service charges and you can see them coming off the bottom as you look at the linked quarters. Fees now will grow with the volume of cards and accounts that are now net growing in our company. Our mortgage business is now sized appropriately for our franchise and the fee line there Paul will talk about later, but will be as that near where it\u2019s going to be in the future. With regard to revenue more closely tied to markets business, the ups and downs in volumes of activity in sales and trading in investment banking and brokerage will move back and forth with the market. But the important thing is we have strong businesses, strong client-facing businesses in these areas and we\u2019re getting our share of these revenue streams even while the markets ebbs and flows. So if we look about move from the fee line to the expense line, many of you give us credit for having managed expenses from $70 billion five years ago to the mid-$50 billion today. But the question is can we do more? And if you look at this quarter we continue to manage expenses well. Noninterest expense this quarter was $13.5 billion, improving more than 3.5% or 3% from 2015 second quarter. This continues a trend of performance that has shown expense declining significantly on a quarterly basis quarter-after-quarter over the past several years. This is the lowest level that we have reported since the fourth quarter of 2008, and that\u2019s prior to the Merrill Lynch merger. If you look at our efficiency ratio and normalize it for the NII adjustment stated above, it would be about 62% this quarter. That\u2019s an improvement 200 basis points from last year\u2019s second quarter. Cost control and cost effectiveness is a focus for our management team here at Bank of America. So the question is how much more can we do on expenses? So if you think about this, let\u2019s start by looking at the costs of the most recent four quarters. In the trailing four quarters the total expense base was $56.3 billion. As we look out from the second \u2013 the third quarter of 2016 through the next six quarters into 2018, we believe that with our SIM efforts and the continued work we\u2019re doing across the board on expenses, we\u2019re targeting an annual expense number of around $53 billion in total expenses for the year 2018. So over six quarters we continue to absorb investment, merit increases, rising healthcare costs, and bring the expenses down a nominal amount. Our continued work in driving down costs to service delinquent loans will help with this, but the other reductions are generally coming from the core work and simplified improved. The work we continue to do to simplify those work processes but also the core work we do to allow us to self-fund our growth initiatives, are continuing investments in technology and salespeople. While I\u2019m on the topic of expenses, I want to point out another important milestone for our company in quarter. This quarter we changed our reporting to eliminate the legacy assets in the servicing segment. This completes transformation. This segment was last place for product orientation was reported, not customer orientation. And more importantly, it also reflects the last of legacy is really behind us from an operational basis. We added a couple slides in the appendix today to go along with our 8-K we filed a few days ago. They explain the methodology of the realignment of LAS and the highlights that impacts the segment with those loans and associated P&L are reported now. But what I want to get to across to you is LAS as an operational segment successfully did what it was tasked to do : to clean up one of the largest mortgage servicing businesses in the U.S. Consider that progress. From 1.4 million delinquent mortgage loans we\u2019re down to 80,000 a day. At one point we had 58,000 teammates and 20,000 contractors working on this task, and now we\u2019re down to 10,000 teammates. From one peak a quarter of $3 billion plus in expenses, we\u2019re down to $600 million this quarter. That phase of the work is complete and we need to move that operating business in with the rest of the company to do the further consolidation and further work to improve our servicing cost. We are pleased with the accomplishments of this group but there is still more to be done. And that brings us to our provision. Simply put, the question we often get is, is credit deteriorating? As you can see, we remain very pleased with both consumer and commercial credit performance. Not only have net charge-offs not gotten worse, but they have improved in the most recent quarter moving back below $1 billion. Provision expense is and will remain roughly equivalent to net charge-offs. Even our energy portfolio we have seen lower exposures improve losses. And that brings us to our returns. In this operating environment, can we get our returns above our cost of capital? Well as you can see, we\u2019ve made solid progress on our returns this quarter. Our return on tangible common equity adjusted for the market related and DVA impacts was 10.9%. On a similarly adjusted basis, ROA has moved to 90 basis point. We still have work to do, but you can see the improvement coming through. As we move to slide four, you can see our business segment results. You see strong year-over-year results in every business driven by the generation of operating leverage. Consumer banking continue its momentum around client activity and operating leverage. Consumer satisfaction continues to improve as does adoption and use of digital capabilities and functionality. And our wealth management business, they grew earnings as costs declined more than revenue while we continue to invest in this business. Revenue is impacted by AUM valuations from market variability. Our global banking team drove results with continued solid loan growth, operating leverage of 9% and strong credit results. Global markets executed well for its clients, as I stated earlier, in a very difficult period, and used operating leverage to grow its earnings year over year as well. So on a combined basis, those four business segments improved 16% from last year\u2019s second quarter earning about $5 billion this quarter. Partially offsetting this was the loss at all other, and that primarily reflects the market related NII adjustments I spoke about earlier. You can see the returns and efficiency ratios for each of these segments, and note that each segment is earning well above our cost of capital. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Paul to take you through the numbers. Paul Donofrio : Thanks, Brian. Good morning, everyone. Since Brian covered the income statement, I will start with the balance sheet on page five. As you know, when general deposit flows drive the size of our balance sheet, and they on a lending basis were relatively flat this quarter as inflows were partially offset by outflows to fund seasonal tax payments. So total assets were stable compared to Q1 with loans increasing modestly, security balances rising and cash down a corresponding amount. Liquidity also saw a small decline. However, we remain well compliant with LCR requirements. Tangible common equity of $170 billion improved by $3.6 billion from Q1, driven by earnings and OCI. This was partially offset by 1.1 billion in share repurchases and roughly 500 million in common dividends. As a reminder, following the CCAR results we announced an increase in both our share repurchase authorization as well as a planned increase of 50% in our quarterly dividend. On a per share basis, tangible book value per share increased to $16.68, up 11% from Q2 2015. Turning to regulatory metrics, as a reminder, we report capital under the advanced approaches. Our CET 1 transition ratio under Basel III ended the quarter at 10.6%. On a fully phased-in basis, CET 1 capital improved $4.3 billion to $161.8 billion. Under the advanced approaches compared to Q1 2016, the CET 1 ratio increased seven basis points to 10.5% and is above our current 2019 requirement. RWA declined roughly 13 billion, driven by reductions related to retail exposures primarily from credit improvement. We also provide our capital metrics under the standardized approach. Here our CET 1 ratio improved to 11.4%. Supplementary leverage ratio for both parent and bank continue to exceed U.S. regulatory minimums that take effect in 2018. Turning to slide six and on an average basis, total loans were up 7 billion from Q1 and 23 billion or 3% from Q2 2015. On an ending period basis, loan growth this quarter was impacted by pay-downs near the end of the quarter and the non-U.S. corporate loan facilities and about 1.6 billion in FX translations across international loans, including the K Card [ph]. Note on the slide, there is a breakdown of the loans in our business segments and all other. Again, on an average basis year-over-year, loans and all other were driven by 42 billion driven by continued runoff of first and second main mortgages while loans in our Business segments were up 65 billion or 9%. In Consumer Banking we continued to see strong growth in consumer real estate and vehicle lending, offset somewhat by runoff in home equity outpacing originations. In Wealth management, we saw growth in consumer real estate and structured lending. Global banking loans were up 35 billion or 12% year over year and up 7% annualized from Q1. Deposits were stable with Q1 at 1.2 trillion, but grew 67 billion or 6% from Q2 2015. Broad-based growth was led by consumer, increasing more than 44 billion or 8% year over year, while wealth management deposits grew 6% and deposits with corporate clients and global banking improved nearly 4%. Turning to asset quality on slide seven, we saw improvement from Q1. Total net charge-offs improved 83 million from Q1 to less than 1 billion in Q2. Consumer losses declined modestly across a number of products, and while slight commercial losses also declined from Q1 as a result of lower energy losses, provision of 976 million in Q2 was down $21 million from Q1. Finally, we had a small overall net reserve release in the quarter as consumer releases were modestly offset by builds in commercial. On slide eight, we provide credit quality data on our consumer portfolio. Net charge-offs declined $68 million from Q1. While driven by lower real estate losses, the improvement, as I mentioned, was broad-based. Over half of the losses in this book are U.S. credit card, where the loss rate improved five basis points from Q1 to 2.66%. Delinquency levels and NPLs improved and reserve coverage remains strong. Moving to the commercial credits on slide nine, net charge-offs improved $15 million from Q1 as energy losses declined. Energy charge-offs decreased $23 million from Q1 to $79 million this quarter. There isn\u2019t a lot of new news on the commercial asset quality front other than the modest improvement in our energy-related exposure. As you all know, the price of oil and gas was more stable in Q2. Within this backdrop, we experienced some improvement in both energy losses and exposure. A few clients refinanced with equity issuances and other financing solutions, which also helped improve exposures. Overall, our committed energy exposure declined $3 billion from Q1, with utilized exposure declining more modestly and exposure to exploration and production as well as oilfield services, which we believe are the two higher-risk subsectors, declined 1% from Q1. Outside of energy, commercial asset quality continues to perform well. Let me share with you a few metrics that exhibit the quality of this book and its performance. The reservable criticized exposure ratio is 3.8%, and excluding energy, metals and mining, exposure is 2.4%, which is near pre-recession levels. The commercial net charge-off ratio excluding small business has been below 15 basis points for 14 consecutive quarters, even with the elevated levels of energy charge-offs we experienced over the past three quarters. The NPL ratio which today is at 37 basis points has been below 40 basis points for 11 consecutive quarters. Turning to slide 10, net interest income on a reported non-FTE basis was $9.2 billion. Included in NII this quarter was a negative $974 million market-related adjustment to true-up bond premium amortization. This follows Q1\u2019s more negative adjustment of $1.2 billion, and it\u2019s important to note that the adjustment in Q2 2015 was a benefit of $669 million. NII on an FTE basis excluding market-related adjustments was $10.4 billion. This was lower than Q1 primarily due to lower long end rates and Q1\u2019s seasonal impacts. Compared to Q2 2015, results were up nearly $400 million, or 4%, as higher short end rates combined with loan growth funded by deposits offset the negative impact of lower long end rates. Looking forward to Q3, we will benefit from an extra day which will be offset by the impact of declines in long end rates over the past two quarters and put pressure on our MBS bond yields and reinvestment yields more generally. As we get into Q4 and the next year, we get more optimistic about NII, assuming both the current forward curve and the current pace of loan and deposit growth. With respect to asset sensitivity, as of 6/30, an instantaneous 100 basis point parallel increase in rates is estimated to increase NII by $7.5 billion over the subsequent 12 months driven by the increase in long end rates. Now we think it\u2019s also important to understand what we expect to happen to NII if rates don\u2019t rise. Referring to the bottom left of the slide, the adjusted NII has been fairly stable, averaging between $10.3 billion and $10.4 billion over the past five quarters. If we have stability in long end rates, we would expect to maintain that level in the near-term, again, assuming modest loan and deposit growth. Rates moving up or down from here would obviously impact that perspective slightly in the near-term, but building as we extend that scenario into future quarters and years. Turning to slide 11, noninterest expense was $13.5 billion in the quarter. That is a half a billion dollars or 3% lower than Q2 2015 driven by good expense discipline across the company. As you can see, we are presenting expenses a little bit differently now that we have eliminated the LAS segment. Having said that, we made steady progress on reducing legacy loan servicing costs this quarter and we still expect to achieve our original goal of lowering the former LAS segment costs ex-litigation to $500 million in Q4. Q2 litigation expense was $270 million which was higher by $95 million than Q1 2015, so year-over-year expense improvement ex-litigation was actually $600 million. Nearly every category of cost was lower year-over-year. It was led by personnel including the expiration of the fully amortized advisor awards and the revenue related incentives mostly in wealth management. While the rest of the improvement I would characterize as just good, hard work, grinding expenses lower through SIM and other initiatives. While the rate of decline has been slowing, our employee base is down 3% from Q2 2015. As the employee base continues to go lower, we think it\u2019s important to point out that the reductions on a percentage basis now include more highly paid managerial associates. So while the rate of FTE reduction has slowed, the relationship to expense reductions is not linear. Also, we continue to increase the number of client-facing associates to drive growth while at the same time through SIM and other efforts simplify and streamline activities and thereby reduce non-client-facing positions. Lastly, as I said last quarter, we expect our quarterly FDIC expense to increase approximately $100 million for a number of quarters starting in Q3 2016. Turning to the business segments and starting with consumer banking on slide 12, consumer earned $1.7 billion, continuing its trend of solid improvement and reporting a robust 20% return on allocated capital. Revenue and earnings were driven by deposit and loan growth coupled with continued expense improvement driving operating leverage. As a result of this operating leverage, the efficient ratio improved roughly 360 basis points year-over-year. Note that the lack of reserve releases this quarter versus a meaningful release last year mitigated some of the improvement in the operating leverage. So while earnings were up 3% year-over-year, pre-tax pre-provision earnings rose 11%. On slide 13, we focus on additional key consumer banking trends. First on the upper left, the stats are a reminder of our strong competitive position. Revenue increased by 107 million and NII growth more than offset lower noninterest income. Net interest income continued to improve as we drove deposits and loans higher. Noninterest income was down due mostly to lower mortgage banking income. This decline is in part a result of selling fewer loans and instead holding more on our balance sheet, thereby shifting mortgage banking income to NII. Expense declined 5% from Q2 2015. The positive expense trend is a result of a number of initiatives. As an example, I would note that our growth to mobile banking continues to play an important role in helping us optimize our delivery network while improving customer satisfaction. Our cost of deposits as a percentage of average deposits also continued to improve and now stands at 162 basis points. Focusing on client balances on the bottom of the page, Merrill Lynch broker assets at $132 billion or up 8% versus Q2 2015 on strong account flows partially offset by lower market valuations. We increased the number of Merrill Lynch customers by 10% from Q2 2015. We now have more than 1.6 million households using our platform for self-directed trading. Moving across on the bottom right of the page, note that loans are up 5% from Q2 2015 on strong mortgage and vehicle lending growth. Average vehicle loans are up 20% from Q2 2015 with average booked FICO scores remaining well above the 770 level and net losses remaining below 30 basis points and improving on a linked quarter basis. Mortgage loan growth was aided by solid mortgage production of $16 billion, up modestly from Q2 2015, as customers took advantage of historically low interest rates. On consumer card \u2013 or I should say on U.S. Consumer Card, we issued more than 1.3 million cards in the quarter, which is the highest level since 2008. Average balances were modestly down; however, adjusting for divestitures, average card balances grew $1.4 billion compared to Q2 2015. Spending on credit cards adjusted for divestitures was up 7.5% compared to Q2 2015. As we viewed in previous quarters, we continue to focus on originating high FICO loans which generally produce low loss rates and strong risk adjusted margins. Last quarter, we highlighted the quality of our underwriting in the consumer business. This quarter, we\u2019re highlighting our leading position in digital banking. This technology continues to reshape how our customers bank. Importantly, as adoption rises, particularly around transaction processing and self-service, we see improved efficiency and customer satisfaction. We added more than 2.5 million new mobile customers in the past 12 months. With more than 20 million active users, deposits from devices now represents 17% of deposit transactions. Mobile customers on average process 280,000 deposits per day, an increase of 28% year-over-year and the equivalent to volume of 800 financial centers. Mobile sales are up nearly 50% from last year. We\u2019re promoting mobile sales and electronic adoption by deploying digital ambassadors in our financial centers. We now have more than 3,500 digital ambassadors in our branches engaging with customers who come into the branch to transact. They educate these customers on alternatives to branch banking, which are not only more convenient for them but also more efficient for us. Digital sales, appointments and satisfaction all continue to achieve new highs. Also as you know, we are a leader in person-to-person and person-to-business money movement through digital transfers and bill payment capabilities. The adoption and popularity of these capabilities continues to drive growth with record volume of $246 billion this quarter, up nearly 5% year-over-year. Turning to slide 15. Global Wealth and Investment Management produced earnings of $722 million, up 8% from Q2 2015. Year-over-year, revenue was down modestly but expenses were down even more, improving pre-tax margin to 26%, up meaningfully from Q2 2015. This quarter included a modest gain from the previously announced sale of Bank of America Global Capital Management. This reduced AUM comprised of short-term liquid assets by approximately $80 billion. Overall, revenue declined 2% from Q2 2015, as strong NII growth and the gain were more than offset by lower market-sensitive revenue. Asset management revenues declined from Q2 2015 on lower market values while improving modestly on a linked-quarter basis. Transactional revenue was down and continues to be impacted by market uncertainty as well as the migration of activity from brokerage to managed relationships. NII benefited from solid deposit and loan growth. Non-interest expense declined nearly $200 million or 6% from Q2 2015, with half of that benefit derived from the expiration of the amortization of advisor retention awards that were put in place at the time of the Merrill Lynch merger. The rest of the improvement was a result of lower revenue-related incentives and other support costs. Moving to slide 16. Despite volatile markets, we continued to see overall solid client engagement. Client balances at $2.4 trillion were down from Q1; but excluding the sale I mentioned earlier were up from Q1, as higher market valuation levels, $10 billion of long-term AUM flows and loan growth more than offset tax-related deposit outflows. Driven by the expected seasonality, average deposits were down from Q1 as clients paid income taxes. Importantly, average deposits are up 6% from Q2 2015, driven by growth in the second half of 2015. Average loans also grew this quarter. Growth was concentrated in consumer real estate and structured lending as well. Turning to slide 17. Global Banking earned $1.5 billion, producing solid improvement over both Q1 and year-over-year. Returns on allocated capital was 16%, a 200 basis point improvement from Q2 2015, despite adding $2 billion in allocated capital. Double-digit percent revenue growth year-over-year offset a low single digit expense growth creating strong operating leverage that improved the efficiency ratio to 45%. Global banking continues to drive solid loan growth within its risk and client frameworks producing solid year-over-year improvement in NII. Revenue benefited this quarter from mark-to-market gains on our FBO loan portfolio due to recovery in certain energy and mining exposures. Higher Treasury fees and leasing gains also aided the improvement from Q2 2015. While total investment banking fees for the firm were down from Q2 2015, global banking gained a little share supported by M&A fees which were up on an absolute basis. A modest increase in noninterest expense compared to Q2 2015 reflects the cost of adding sales professionals over the past 12 months and a modest increase in incentive related due to do the higher revenue. Looking at trends on page 18, and comparing Q2 last year, clients were comforted \u2013 excuse me, clients were confronted with increased volatility once again this quarter, with concerns around both global growth as well as the outcome of the U.K. referendum. However, despite concerns, companies still need to finance as well as store and move their money, and this is when the strength and diversity of our franchise is most appreciated by our clients. Average loans on a year-over-year basis grew $35 billion or 12%. Growth was broad-based across large corporates as well as middle market borrowers and spread across most products. Having said that, we slowed our construction-led commercial real estate lending a few quarters ago. Average deposits increased from Q2 2015, up 11 billion or 4% from both new and existing clients. Switching to global markets on slide 19, the past couple of quarters are great examples of the importance of this segment to not only its clients around the world but also to our customers and clients in all our business segments. Customers and clients were able to live their financial lives better in Q2 because global markets delivered for them under challenging market conditions, helping them raise capital, buy and sell securities, as well as manage risk. We believe we increased our relevance with clients during Q2 and more specifically during the market volatility after the U.K. referendum. We did this by showing them that we will be there for them when they need us most. That we are there for them with consistent set of products and services at terms that make sense for our clients and our shareholders. And therefore, then, with thoughtful advice as well as the capabilities, strength, and confidence to make markets and execute, all of this resulted in global markets reporting earnings of $1.1 billion and a return on capital of 12%, 13% excluding net DVA impact. Revenue was up appreciably year-over-year as well as linked quarter. Total revenue excluding DVA was up 8% year-over-year on solid sales and trading results and up 18% over a Q1 that saw challenging market conditions. Strong expense management drove expenses 6% lower year-over-year even while revenue was higher. Moving to trends on the next slide, and focusing on the components of our sales and trading performance, sales and trading revenue of $3.7 billion excluding net DVA was up 12% from Q2 2015 driven by FICC. In terms of revenue, this was the best second quarter we have had in the past five years. Excluding DVA and versus Q2 2015, FICC sales and trading of $2.6 billion increased 22% as the improvement which began in late Q1 continued through Q2 as global concerns abated and central banks took further monetary policy actions. Improvement was across both macro and credit products driven by stronger rates and currency, client activity as well as improved credit market conditions. Tighter spreads benefited mortgage, trading and municipal bonds outperformed treasuries with strong retail demand. Equity sales and trading was $1.1 billion, declining 8% versus Q2 2015 which saw significant client activity in Asia driven by stock market rallies in the region. On slide 21, we show all other which reported a loss of $815 billion. This loss was driven by the current quarter\u2019s $974 million market related NII adjustment. The loss is lower than Q1 due to both a lower market related NII adjustment as well as the absence of retirement-eligible incentive costs. Compared to Q2 2015, the difference is driven by a number of factors. First, the negative NII market-related adjustment in this quarter versus a large positive adjustment in Q2 2015. Second, we had reps and warranty recoveries in Q2 2015 related to a court ruling and gains on the sale of consumer real estate loans. Third, provision expense declined from Q2 2015 driven by continued portfolio improvement. The effective tax rate for the quarter was about 29%, which is in-line with what we expect for the remainder of the year, absent any unusual items. And as a reminder, we still expect to record a tax charge of about $350 million, most likely in 3Q that reduces the carrying value of our U.K. DTAs as a result of the U.K. tax reform announced last year. The vast majority of this charge will not impact regulatory capital. Okay. So let me offer a few takeaways as I finish. Q2 was another quarter of solid progress in a challenging global environment. While growth concerns persist in many countries, the U.S. economy continues to steadily improve, albeit at a less than optimum pace. The diversity and strength of our franchise makes us more relevant to clients and customers during times such as these, and you can see that in our results. Clearly, interest rates affected our financial performance this quarter. Still, while we cannot control interest rates, we are not waiting for them to rise. We grew in this environment by focusing on the things that we can control and drive. We grew deposits, we grew loans, we managed risk well, reflected in reduced charge-offs. We delivered for customer clients in another challenging quarter, especially around the U.K. referendum. We invested in our future by adding sales professionals and continuing to deploy technology that improves customer satisfaction. We returned capital to shareholders and we announced plans to return increasing amounts. And we did all of this while we lowered expenses and drove operating leverage Thank you. And with that, let\u2019s open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. We\u2019ll take our first question from Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Matt O\u2019Connor: Good morning. Brian Moynihan : Good morning. Matt O\u2019Connor: I had a few follow ups on the expense commentary. I guess first, though, just maybe what drove the timing of giving a three-year expense outlook? Is it acknowledging kind of lower for longer rates? Is it finding more opportunities, or what was kind of the motivation to give expense outlook for 2018 at this point? Brian Moynihan : Well, Matt, as we looked at it, this is our current plan, so there\u2019s no new news for us in terms of how we operate the company. But what we saw is that people were not sort of getting the expenses right in the out years thinking that we could not continue the rate of investment and continue to bring down expenses. Secondly, to make sure people understood it in terms of blending in LAS and putting it into the base. It\u2019s now become less of the contribution and now it\u2019s more the general expense base we\u2019re working on. So I think it was consistent with the way we\u2019re running the company but we want to make sure that people had clarity over the next six quarters and going into 2018 of where we think the expense base goes versus what we saw in some of your guys\u2019 estimates and stuff. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay. And then I guess specifically, the $53 billion that you pointed to, does that include the first quarter stock expense of around a billion and some I assume nominal amount for legal? Brian Moynihan : Yeah, it includes an estimate based on current views of both. That\u2019s all-in expenses for the year. Now they come in different quarters, as you just pointed out. We have it front-loaded of that, but \u2013 so this quarter did not include that I think it was about a quarter of a billion dollars plus a quarter when you think about the $13.5 billion this quarter. But overall, it includes the estimate for that out there plus the litigation estimate. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay. And then just separately, if I can ask, we\u2019ve had a couple other banks talk about loosening standards a bit on the consumer side. I feel like you\u2019ve held your standards quite high, especially in credit card. But just any thoughts on appetite for loosening standards a little bit here, given the challenging rate environment and the economy still hanging in there? Paul Donofrio : We\u2019ve worked I think extraordinarily hard to transform the company, its balance sheet, its ability to produce earnings. We\u2019ve got a customer and risk framework on the consumer side that is focused on prime and super prime. That strategy, I think, works for our shareholders and our customers and we\u2019re sticking to it. Brian Moynihan : And just to give you a simple view of that, Matt, this quarter we did the highest number of new credit card originations we\u2019ve done for a long time. And all of them are consistent with that risk appetite. So there\u2019s plenty of market share to gain there by just concentrating on current customers and deepening. And while people always ask the question you ask, the answer is there\u2019s still about seven out of 10 mortgage customers at Bank of America get their mortgage somewhere else that fit within our credit customers. There\u2019s plenty of cardholder that fit our credit parameters that are out there that don\u2019t have our card or aren\u2019t using our card as their primary card. And so just giving those couple of examples, there\u2019s plenty of market share to get there. So we don\u2019t need to change the standards to grow and you\u2019re seeing that come through. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : And we\u2019ll take the next question from Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead. Jim Mitchell : Hey. Good morning. Brian Moynihan : Good morning. Jim Mitchell : Maybe I could follow up a little bit on the NII discussion. Maybe if you could help us think through \u2013 you talked about near-term kind of flattish, but as we think a little bit longer term, if the forward curve is realized and/or maybe give some color. You\u2019ve had good deposit growth, core loan growth of 9% but net loan growth\u2019s only been about 2.5%. Do we start to see that inflect more? And does that start to help the out years as well? So just any color on NII beyond the next quarter or two would be helpful. Brian Moynihan : Sure. Look, as I said in my comments, if rate follow the current path of the forward curve, we would expect with the extra day and the client long-term rates to be at around a $10.4 billion range in the next quarter. So... Jim Mitchell : Right. Brian Moynihan : But as you get out to 4Q and next year, I think we get more optimistic about being able to grow, given just our current pace of deposit and loan growth. We\u2019ve obviously experiencing good deposit growth. We\u2019ve got, as we talked about, a strong risk in client framework, so we\u2019d like to put all of that deposit growth into loan growth. But we\u2019re going to only do so if it meets our criteria. Whatever deposit growth doesn\u2019t get absorbed by good loans with our clients obviously goes into the investment portfolio and we get a return there. So I think, look, it\u2019s just a question of the further you get out, the more that wave of deposits and asset growth kind of overwhelms the change in interest rates and we see growth. Paul Donofrio : Also if you look at page six, you can see that \u2013 a point you made is that the inflection point was hit a few quarters ago where the sort of the non-core loans and leases were running down and not being made up by growth. We\u2019ve passed that. And so as we think about it going forward, in the upper right-hand part of page six, you can see that other loan and leases balances coming down. They\u2019ll continue to come down but there\u2019s just less of them. And then if you look at the lower left, you see the core loans are growing at a good rate, have been growing a good rate now can come through. So I think your point about what give us encouragement because you saw it last year second quarter, this year second quarter about how even in a lower for longer rate environment we can grow NII is that you\u2019re actually are growing the net loan book pretty consistently now each quarter. Jim Mitchell : So I guess you don\u2019t want to put too many numbers around it. But should we think that maybe starting in 4Q or 1Q, we might start to see some incremental NII growth; and maybe that accelerates \u2013 as you point out, the loan growth overwhelms the rate picture? Paul Donofrio : I think we\u2019d say that you got to be careful about your rate scenario, even on a spot basis because it can move around and move that around. But think about it as second quarter next year, you\u2019d start to see this breakthrough again, based on absolutely no change in rates from the low point they were. Jim Mitchell : Right. Okay. Great. Thanks. Operator : And we\u2019ll take the next question from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Ken Usdin : Hey. Good morning, guys. Just one. On the fee side, you mentioned all the great metrics in terms of the growth of activity and account growth and whatnot. But we\u2019re continuing to see declines year-over-year in card income, service charges and the brokerage business. So I was wondering, you can walk us through when do you anticipate some of the, kind of the building blocks turning into revenue? Or are there still some of the \u2013 kind of the spending or kind of competitive pressures building in underneath? So just kind of the outlook for some of those kind of core consumer and brokerage-related fee areas would be great. Thanks. Paul Donofrio : Okay. Well, let\u2019s start with card. I think card actually is up on a linked-quarter basis, down year-over-year. But you have to remember, again, we had portfolio divestitures. So I think we\u2019re at the point now, we\u2019re not going to be seeing those sorts of divestitures in the future. And we start feeling better about more consistent growth around card. If you look at brokerage income, we have been in a multi-quarter, trend of people shifting from brokerage to more managed accounts. That trend has obviously put pressure on the revenue line because at the same time that was going on, we had had a lot of volatility in the marketplace, lower overall capital markets, lower overall activity. But I think over time as \u2013 if capital markets continue to rise, we will get \u2013 we will offset that decline in transactional revenue. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Glenn Schorr : [Audio gap] in terms of FA attrition? And then the second part is in Wealth Management, what specific products or behavioral changes are you putting in place ahead of the DOL rules kicking in in April? Brian Moynihan : So on the first quarter, we haven\u2019t seen any change in attrition after retention. And most of the retention \u2013 most of the attrition experienced financial advisors have been more due to our change in our way we do the international business, which has been going on for about a year. But in terms of aggregate numbers, it\u2019s been relatively stable. In terms of the attrition we see is actually in the lower production levels, mainly due to people not being able to kind of build a book of business. And we\u2019re trying to fix that through the integrated business system with our consumer and preferred teams. In terms of DOJ and the fiduciary standard, we\u2019re visibly implementing this. It\u2019s consistent with where we\u2019re going with the business. It\u2019s consistent with the move from an old view of what financial advisory was versus a managed money fee-based, loaded with a financial planning driven business. Admittedly it\u2019s a little tricky, because the actual rules only apply to the $200-odd billion of 401(K) and retirement assets we have, but it\u2019s consistent with where we\u2019re taking the business and the team drawing we don\u2019t see meaningful revenue or changes due to that. We\u2019ll see meaningful changes to implemented, but not meaningful revenue changes. Glenn Schorr : Okay. I appreciate that. And just a follow-up on the 2018 expense target, which everyone appreciates, it might be a silly question, but should \u2013 is it safe to assume that 2017 will be somewhere between 2016 and actual in 2018\u2019s target? Brian Moynihan : Well, we\u2019ve got \u2013 yes, it\u2019s a safe assumption. It\u2019s not a silly question. But we\u2019ve got six quarters between now and then, and you can see what we\u2019re running at now to get it down to that level. It will take work every quarter. Glenn Schorr : Okay. Thanks, Brian. Operator : We\u2019ll take the next question from Steven Chubak with Nomura. Please go ahead. Steven Chubak : Hi. Good morning. Brian Moynihan : Morning. Steven Chubak : So I hate to beat a dead horse on the expense question, but, Brian or Paul, I was hoping you could provide some more detail as to what specific expense levers you can pull to really drive that figure to 53 billion? It is a pretty meaningful delta versus the 56 billion run rate over the last four quarters. I\u2019m just trying to gauge how those expense initiatives might impact revenues? And whether we should expect any revenue attrition as those additional initiatives take hold? Brian Moynihan : Sure. So let me just back up a little bit. I will definitely answer your question, but I want to emphasize again, we\u2019re talking about LTM 56 billion going to 53 billion, absorbing in that merit, healthcare, inflation and other investment. And the first thing I would point out as you sort of think about the credibility of that, look at what we accomplished over the last five years. From Q2 2011 to Q2 2016 we have reduced quarterly expenses by $4.8 billion. That\u2019s a $19 billion annualized run rate. And we did this by not only reducing legacy mortgage related expenses, which were only make up $2 billion of that $4.8 billion, but just through good expense management in every major category across the company. So from here it\u2019s about a number of things. A lot of those things have been identified through our simplify and improve initiative. We\u2019re investing in technology and capabilities to improve efficiency. The most obvious example of that you can see is in the increasing adoption of customers for digital channels. But I do want to emphasize that it is, you know \u2013 it is about making progress across the entire company from our leaders and our teams. So if you look in consumer, they\u2019re an example of the digital adoption. We\u2019ve got mobile users of 15% over 2015. When they make a deposit, that\u2019s one-tenth the cost. We\u2019ve got digital sales up 12% year-over-year. We\u2019ve got more customers using digital statements, a lot more work to do there with transition from paper to electronic. We are optimizing the coverage model in both consumer and GWIM, and they all have goals. We all have goals and initiatives around controllable expenses including travel, supply, support costs. If you look at global banking and global markets, we\u2019re simplifying our legal entity structure and business model. We\u2019re integrating wholesale credit origination and processing across the lines of business. We\u2019re centralizing data platforms. We\u2019re expanding electronic capabilities and we\u2019re optimizing the coverage model. So, you know, there\u2019s a lot going on and we\u2019re going to need all of it to get to our goals Steven Chubak : Okay. So, Paul, from based on your comment, it sounds like it\u2019s really going to be driven by technology and other efficiency initiatives. So there shouldn\u2019t be any expectation that we could see any meaningful revenue drop-off or attrition in light of those actions that you\u2019re taking? Brian Moynihan : I think Paul gave you a lot of different places it comes from, but I think you have to back up and say it comes from reducing the expense base and by people. And you can see that even in markets, year-over-year we\u2019re down 7% and people revenue went up. So it\u2019s electronification of fixed income platform and the equity\u2019s platform continue down that road. So every single area is moving here and then if you also have to think about the stability of the platform, this company has now been operating with a consistent strategy and a consistent ability to execute for many years. And what\u2019s gone with the legacy and stuff that just allows us to keep operating on ourselves. And we always have performed best in history when we had that period of time no acquisitions, no divestitures, no legacy asset servicing. So we\u2019re very confident that it will happen. On revenue, I\u2019d say look at it year-over-year, look at it linked quarter so last three or four quarters you\u2019re seeing revenue is stable and well bounces around with market activity in a given quarter. The core revenue continues to go forward and the expenses keep coming down on a core basis. So we\u2019re comfortable that there\u2019s nothing \u2013 we won\u2019t allow our people and our responsible growth to give us cost saves and not grow the business. So it has to be sustainable. It has to be actually taking out real work and yet still investing in more client-facing teammates, more salespeople and more technology capability for customers. Steven Chubak : Thanks very much. Operator : We\u2019ll take the next question from Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities. Please go head. Eric Wasserstrom : Thanks. Just a couple of questions on auto and then one clarification on the OpEx guidance. I\u2019m sorry to come back to that but on the OpEx, is it the 2018 figure where you expect to begin 2018 or end 2018? Paul Donofrio : That\u2019s for the full year. Eric Wasserstrom : For the full year. On auto, you underscored the origination quality and the high end of the FICO range, but one of the things that we\u2019re hearing from dealers is, is about the compression and pricing that\u2019s occurring in the high end ranges, some other lenders move up out of the mid-FICO range. And I wanted to see if that\u2019s something that you think you\u2019re experiencing or if you\u2019re in fact seeing some stabilization in the competitive area around high FICO auto lending. Paul Donofrio : I would say we haven\u2019t experienced that. We can check and get back to you. I would \u2013 I would just make a couple more comments about auto. We are \u2013 we\u2019re maintaining our share, but we are very focused on the prime and super prime. And as we pointed out last quarter, we\u2019re booking these loans at FICO scores of around 70, 74. We\u2019ve got debt-to-income at all-time lows, and importantly, we are not from a structuring standpoint extending kind of way we see in the marketplace. Eric Wasserstrom : Thanks very much. Operator : We\u2019ll take the next question from Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead. Mike Mayo : Hi. Still more on expenses. This might be good news bad news. I guess the good news is your expenses over the last year, branches are down 2%, FTE down 3%, almost every expense line is lower. So that\u2019s good. And your efficiency ratio is down to 62%. But the bad news the way I look at it is over the last five years, your expenses are down a lot, but your core revenues are down even more. So what might resolve at least the issue in my mind? Do you have a specific efficiency target for 2018? Paul Donofrio : Well, Mike, the \u2013 if you look at the risk adjusted revenue, you would come to a different conclusion. So, yes, we had a lot of revenue in 2011 or 2012, but the charge-offs were running tens of billions of dollars more a year than we have now. So a lot of that revenue was just going off the back end. So if you look at it from a risk adjusted basis, I think we grew from a low 60s to the low 80s over the last five or six years. So that is actually the work that gets done. So we could \u2013 going back a point, we focus on very high credit quality so we keep that credit cost moving in the right direction or stable when the world has gone a different way. We don\u2019t have a target efficiency ratio. You can calculate on of that out in 2018 because as we talked about earlier, the NII differences will be driven by where rates go to some degree. But the idea is we are going to take expenses from $56 billion in the last four quarters to $53 billion and we think that\u2019s where we\u2019ll get them to. And if rates stay stable or go up a little bit, you\u2019ll see a lower efficiency ratio. Right now, we\u2019re running about 62% this quarter fairly stated and we think we can push it down from here. Mike Mayo : And I don\u2019t want to take away \u2013 I think we collectively appreciate having a 2018 expense target, but if you just take the second quarter annualized, you\u2019re at $54 billion, and then if you reduce your LAS expenses, you kind of get down to a $53 billion number. So if... Paul Donofrio : Mike, you\u2019re missing the FAS 123 and social security, which is $1.2 billion in the first quarter that doesn\u2019t occur this quarter but you\u2019ve got to add that back too. Mike Mayo : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And you said a lot is anything on, and I think some other analysts tried to restate what you\u2019re saying. But what are the three biggest drivers then of that reduction of what you might term a core expense base? Paul Donofrio : It\u2019s then people. We\u2019re down 2,600 people quarter over quarter. It\u2019s a constant reduction in personnel through hard work and automation while we\u2019re continuing to increase the investment in salespeople. And so that helps on the revenue side and the revenue equation versus expense. It\u2019s the things like our data center configuration. We\u2019ve been in a program to take about a billion, billion and a half out of the data work, all the data centers and configuration that we\u2019re part way through. And in part it\u2019s just like Paul said, every line item is just grinding that. As we continue to bring down people, we have less occupancy, less telecommunications and everything else. So it really comes across the board. Mike Mayo : And then lastly, should we expect a restructuring charge? Or do you pay as you go? Paul Donofrio : We have consistently paid as we\u2019ve gone, as you well know, and even in every quarter we have between $50 million and $100 million of severance expense that we don\u2019t even talk bout. Mike Mayo : All right. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan Vivek Juneja : Hi. I won\u2019t beat the dead horse on expenses. Just a quick question on the card business. If I look at purchase volumes year on year, it slowed further from last quarter. Any color on what\u2019s going on there? Paul Donofrio : Yeah, I think purchase volumes are up 7% if you normalize for the divestitures. Vivek Juneja : Okay. But the divestiture happened in 4Q. It slowed from where it was. It was up 2% year on year in the first quarter, and it slowed to 1% year on year in the second quarter. So it seems to me a little bit of a weakening trend. Paul Donofrio : I think we\u2019ve had divestitures in 2Q last year and in the fourth quarter. Vivek Juneja : I know. I am [indiscernible]. Those were both reflected in 1Q 2016 year on year growth rates. And I\u2019m comparing growth rates... Paul Donofrio : Let me just make it simple for you. The year-to-date through July is up \u2013 taking out divestitures, up 4% on debit and credit both and up 7% on credit card purchases normalized for divestitures year to year the first six months plus this part of July. So it\u2019s growing fine. Vivek Juneja : Okay. Got it. Thanks. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Paul Miller with FBR and Company. Please go ahead. PaulMiller: Yeah, thank you very much. On the LAS, so you now consolidate the LAS segment into pretty much the consumer segment. You still \u2013 the last on the appendix you said you had about 11,000 workers in that area where I guess continue to work through about 88,000 loans. Is that number \u2013 should that number continue to move down? Will we continue to see that move down? Or what\u2019s the thoughts behind that? Brian Moynihan : Be careful because those 10,000 people work on the 88,000 loans plus the 3 million good loans. They service both good and not good loans, to make it simple. And so that\u2019s one of the reasons why we\u2019re separating. In all other going forward is the loans that we are actually only loans we\u2019d never do again and that we\u2019re running off 600,000, 700,000 units. Moved into the segments whether it\u2019s consumer, U.S. trust, or Merrill Lynch are the loans that relate to their businesses in terms of servicing costs, too. So that was one of the confusions. As this thing got down, you got the point where the good servicing costs are becoming a more meaningful part of the total. It\u2019ll continue on, because that portfolio, whether it\u2019s direct servicing costs for third parties or even the stuff on the balance sheet, will continue. But to give you a sense, from first quarter, second quarter, we\u2019re down the total head-count of about 2,600. About 900 and change came from LAS from the servicing side. So it still contributes, but its contribution is going down each quarter, because the amount left to service the good stuff and just generally service our portfolio will be a higher percentage of what\u2019s left. Paul Miller : Okay. And then you gave some guidance on where you think LAS expenses will be by the fourth quarter. And I\u2019m not sure I wrote it down correctly, and I might have misinterpreted it, but was it close to 500 million you said? Or am I off somewhere? Brian Moynihan : Yeah, so this quarter we ran about 600 and we said we\u2019d get \u2013 a long time ago we said we\u2019d get to 500 by the fourth quarter this year. So we\u2019re almost there, and the idea is that will be completed. Paul Miller : So is 500 the run rate to service the good loans? I\u2019m confused. Or is that still servicing the bad loans? Brian Moynihan : Both. Paul Miller : Both. Okay. Thank you very much, guys. Operator : The next question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead. Brennan Hawken : Good morning. Sorry to come back here, but I just hate horses. So I\u2019m anything to take another whack at this thing. On expenses, what should we think about as far as your assumptions for legal and then some of your market-related businesses, market-sensitive businesses GOM and markets? Just because the expense line items in those businesses do have a pretty big impact from market conditions. Paul Donofrio : So I\u2019ll start with legal. From a legal perspective, if you look over the last four, five, six, seven quarters, we\u2019ve been running around 300 million per quarter. We did 270 this quarter. You know, that I feel like is a reasonable range if you\u2019re building a model for the near term. And in terms of the Capital Markets businesses, I\u2019m not quite sure I get your question. Obviously they are \u2013 that line is tied to the performance of the business. The total performance of the business, returns, earnings and revenue, and we have \u2013 we have programs in place that we think are competitive with what\u2019s on Wall Street so that we can attract the best of talent and retain the best of talent. We\u2019re constantly benchmarking against those programs, and we feel like we\u2019re where we should be for the quality and the market presence we have in those areas. Q \u2013 Brennan Hawken : Overall, you should think about the environment we\u2019re talking about is an environment consistent where we are now from growth of 1.5%, 2% of U.S. GDP and stuff. So it doesn\u2019t contemplate any change in the current environment from just a general operating principle. Paul Donofrio : Again, remember what I think Brian said and what I emphasized again, that 53 billion is absorbing increases in merit, absorbing increases in healthcare, investment that are just inflation that are just natural in the business. Brennan Hawken : Right. I guess I was just \u2013 so you\u2019re saying that first of all on legal, the 53 billion includes roughly 300 million per quarter rate, and that your operating assumption for the GWIM and other market business would assume a revenue inflation and corresponding payout inflation from those businesses from here? Paul Donofrio : Yeah, based upon our current plan. Brennan Hawken : Got it. Got it. Got it. Paul Donofrio : Within our current plan. And in terms of legal, I hope it\u2019s going to be less than 300 million when we get out there. I\u2019m not telling you to stick that in your model, but that\u2019s a good range to be thinking about. Brennan Hawken : Okay. That\u2019s really helpful. Thank you. And one quick follow up on GWIM, you guys highlight a gain on sale, but could you talk about how much that impacted the margins in that business? And then whether or not there was any EPS tailwind there? Paul Donofrio : Yeah, it\u2019s \u2013 it was 80 billion of AUM again. That was all short-term. It had minimal impact on margins. Minimal. Brennan Hawken : Okay. Thanks. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Matthew Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. MatthewBurnell: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Paul, I wanted to follow up on the mortgage banking side of things. That was one of the areas you highlighted in terms of potential growth. Year over year the mortgage banking revenue was down fairly substantially. It seems like a lot of that was hedging gains and losses and things like that. But you also mentioned that you\u2019re planning on keeping more mortgages that you originate on the balance sheet. Could you give us a little bit more color in terms of how you\u2019re thinking about that going forward, both in terms of the mortgage originations being kept in the balance sheet and sort of how you\u2019re thinking about mortgage banking fees? Brian Moynihan : Sure. Let me \u2013 you\u2019re right. MBI line was down year-over-year. That was planned for. We knew that was coming. I just want to walk \u2013 so for everybody else, I just want to walk through kind of why it\u2019s down and then we can talk a little bit about going forward. So kind of four items. First, we sold an appraisal business last year, so there was revenue in last year\u2019s second quarter that isn\u2019t in this quarter. Second, we had some servicing sales in the second quarter of last year for a gain that we didn\u2019t have this quarter. Third and probably most significant from a revenue perspective is that we have the ace decision in the second quarter last year, so we released last year some reps and warranties. That was a significant amount of benefit last year. And then fourth and probably strategically most important in the point you\u2019re getting to is we are selling less mortgages choosing instead to hold them on our balance sheet, and obviously this decreases MBI but increases NII over time. So and plus you have to note that as we just talked about, servicing bad servicing is going to continue to run off. So if servicing is running off and not being replaced as fast, if we\u2019re holding more mortgages on the balance sheet as we transition from MBI to NII you could see that line continues sort of trend lower. In terms of the mortgages, you know, I think in the short-term, it\u2019s going to be fairly stable and that trend is going to this is a good base. This quarter is a good base to sort of start from. I think that trend lower is going to be, you know, in some quarters very slow because as you point out other items \u2013 other line items are a little bit messy and bounce around there depending on what happens with interest rates. Matthew Burnell : Right. Brian Moynihan : But that\u2019s the trend. In terms of what we\u2019re trying to accomplish, all of the loans we originate that are nonconforming we would like to keep on our balance sheet. And even the conforming loans that have a certain characteristic we\u2019re going to be holding on our balance sheet. So right now that\u2019s around 75-ish percent of the loans we\u2019re originating are going on our balance sheet. Is that helpful? Q \u2013 Matthew Burnell : Yes. Thanks. Thanks very much. Operator : And we\u2019ll go next to Richard Bove with Rafferty Capital. Please go ahead. Richard Bove : Hi. I apologize for going back to the net interest income issue, but obviously the reason why central banks keep interest rates down is because they expect it to increase lending. And I\u2019m wondering if you have any elasticity studies which show what happens to loans when interest rates go down or up. And as part of that, there are multiple examples of what happens to earnings if interest rates go up 100 basis points or down. And I\u2019m wondering if you have done anything to show if interest rates remain flat and loans go up 2%, 5%, 6%, 8% what the impact on earnings would be. Brian Moynihan : Yeah, absolutely. On that last part of your question is precisely what I think we\u2019ve been talking about today in the Q&A and in the remarks. We\u2019ve got interest rates \u2013 we talked about interest rates following the forward curve. We talked about interest rates being flat. And despite both of those circumstances, we think in the out years we can grow NII or in the out quarters we can grow NII because we\u2019re growing deposits, and we\u2019re putting them to work where we can within our risk and client frameworks to grow well priced loans. Any amount of deposits that doesn\u2019t go to our clients and customers we\u2019re sticking in the securities portfolio and getting as much yield as we can get there within the constraints of liquidity and capital risk and interest rate risk. So we think we can grow in even a flat interest rate environment, grow the NII line not necessarily in the next quarter but as we again move out into the future. Brian has already pointed out all the work we\u2019re doing around expenses, so when you combine what we think we can do from a fee base, from an NII perspective and lowering expenses, we think we can grow earnings of a company even if interest rates are flat. Richard Bove : What I\u2019m asking is a lot more specific in the sense that you do this with interest rate changes, right? In other words, there\u2019s these bubble charts which show what will happen to net interest income if interest rates go up 100 basis points. There\u2019s nothing which says what happens to earnings if you see a 5% increase in loans. In other words, what is more important? I mean, in the old days, people would show these charts if you hold interest rates flat and volume goes up, what happens to earnings if you get a 5% increase in lending as a result of interest rates staying so low? Paul Donofrio : Yeah, I get it, Dick. You\u2019re right. I mean, we tend to talk in our disclosures about interest rates moving 100 basis points, 50 basis points, and holding all else kind of equal what\u2019s in our plans. We could just as easily do the opposite. We could hold interest rates flat and then you could see the effect of deposit and loan growth. We certainly have that analysis. That\u2019s how we arrive at our perspective on the future. And I think if that\u2019s something that interests you, maybe after the call, we can kind of share with you some of that work. It\u2019s just math. Richard Bove : Yeah, no, the reason why I\u2019m interested is because the whole discussion that we now have is that interest rates are staying flat, and therefore, bank earnings cannot go up because the other side of the equation which is what happens to volume when interest rates go down is just not discussed at all. So I\u2019d love to talk to you more about it. Paul Donofrio : Yeah, okay. That\u2019d be great. Operator : Okay. Next we\u2019ll go to Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Jim Mitchell : Oh, thanks. Just a quick follow up on the capital ratios. Paul, we saw a pretty big improvement across you and your peers in PP&R on seemingly lower op risk hits, particularly legal. Do we start to see that factor into the advanced approach calculation? You guys get punished pretty hard on op risk in the advanced approach. Do you start to see some, I guess some light at the end of the tunnel of being able to reduce that, given all the reductions in legacy risk assets that you\u2019ve seen? Paul Donofrio : Thanks for noticing. So let me start by saying that we are very pleased with our results in CCAR this year. And we believe they really do reflect all the hard work we\u2019ve been putting into that process and improving capital planning. Operational risk, we have a third of our advanced RWA roughly is operational risk. And we would characterize most of that, Brian might say all of it, as for businesses we\u2019re no longer in, products that we no longer sell, and risk that I don\u2019t think we ever took as a basic Bank of America. So there\u2019s a lot of RWA sitting there, and we have to work overtime to show the regulators that we can get that down. Jim Mitchell : But this \u2013 you\u2019re not \u2013 there\u2019s nothing to read into the results in CCAR yet anyway? Paul Donofrio : No, I don\u2019t think so. I mean, obviously CCAR is on a standardized basis, so it doesn\u2019t incorporate operational risk. Jim Mitchell : No, no. But in the PP&R, they obviously made that point that... Paul Donofrio : Yeah, you\u2019re right. Jim Mitchell : Okay. Paul Donofrio : You\u2019re right. I think they improved their models. I mean, I don\u2019t know, but I think we\u2019re all kind of looking at what they\u2019ve done and trying to understand it, and I think they probably improved their models a little bit around op risk and there was a little bit less across all the banks. I think the banks that had the most maybe benefited because it was more of an average type of thing. Jim Mitchell : Right. Paul Donofrio : So maybe we got a little extra benefit in that. But I don\u2019t know, to tell you the truth. We don\u2019t know what\u2019s in their models. Jim Mitchell : Right. So it\u2019s just a little too early to see any kind of spillover benefits yet? Paul Donofrio : Yes. Jim Mitchell : Okay. Thanks. Operator : It appears we have no further questions at this time. I\u2019ll turn the program back over to our presenters for closing remarks. Brian Moynihan : Thank you very much, and we look forward to talking to you next quarter. Thank you. Operator : And this will conclude today\u2019s program. Thanks for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",

At this time all participants are in listen-only mode. Later you will have the opportunity to ask questions during the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please note this call is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Mr. Lee McEntire. Please go ahead. Lee McEntire : Good morning. Thanks to everybody on the phone as well as the webcast for joining us this morning for the Third Quarter 2016 Results. Hopefully everybody\u2019s had a chance to review the earnings release documents that were available on the website. Before I turn the call over to Brian and Paul, let me remind you, we may make some forward-looking statements. For further information on those, please refer to either our earnings release documents, our website or our SEC filings. One thing before Brian and Paul get into the results, I just want to remind you we file an 8-K on October 4, giving notification the company changed our method of accounting for the amortization of premium and accretion of discounts related to certain debt securities known by the investment community as FAS 91. Our change to the contractual method which is used by the just majority of our peers will provide better comparability of our results.  As a result to the change, we restated our historical results, and provided the historically restated information in the 8-K and our earnings materials today naturally reflect those restatements. With that, let me turn it over to Brian Moynihan, our Chairman and CEO, for some opening comments; before Paul Donofrio, our CFO, goes through the details. Brian? Brian Moynihan : Thank you, Lee. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to review our third quarter results. Our results this quarter continue our progress on our long term strategy. We continue to drive responsible growth and deliver more of the company\u2019s capabilities to our clients and customers. This progress is becoming clear with each successive quarter, and you can see the highlights of that on slide 2.  We reported earnings of $5 billion or $0.41 per diluted share and EPS improvement of 8% from the year ago quarter. We improved operating leverage across the businesses, utilizing technology to lower costs and improve our processes. Our pretax earnings improved 17% compared to the third quarter of 2015. This pretax earnings comparison is important as it eliminates the unusual movements in the tax line like this quarters\u2019 tax charge and the UK corporate tax rate change. Like last quarter, I thought I\u2019d address a few topics before hearing from all of you. To do that, let\u2019s look at slide 3 and 4 of the earnings material. The first question is, are we making progress driving our responsible growth strategy? Yes, we continue to show progress throughout all the businesses. Our revenue growth has more clarity as we move past the periods of significant impacts from implementing regulations, running off non-core portfolios, and divesting non-core businesses.  Revenue grew 3% over the third quarter of last year. Behind that improvement is our continued investment in this great franchise, in our sales teams, in our technology across the board. These sales teams and the buildup we\u2019ve been doing there help us to increase our capacity to serve our customers and clients.  An example of that is in our consumer business, they are focused on being the core bank to all our households. This has resulted in fewer checking accounts than we had years ago, but the average balance of the checking accounts we have has doubled and they are now roughly $65 to $100 per account. You can also see this in the growth of our Merrill Edge brokerage balances, which now total over $138 billion, adding investment relationships to the mass market customer base. In general, consumers are deepening their relationships with us, as they use our straight forward investing tools to get them started on a path to investing. For affluent and wealthy customers, our customer progress also continues. Our global wealth and investment management teams, US Trust and Merrill Lynch not only manage $2 trillion plus in investment balances, but also manage nearly $150 billion in loans and more than $250 billion in deposits, and we continue to see net flows of core assets in that business.  On the commercial side, clients continue to respond to our universal banking model for a simplified stuff for financing, investing, and advisory services. We will continue to operate within in our established risk framework in defined customer groups and we aren\u2019t reaching for growth. This would drive more sustainable results over a longer period of time for our shareholders.  And then with our global peers restructuring, including in the markets business, I think this quarter is another great example of how global markets business is important to our investing and issuing clients. We better client activity driving the best third quarter results we\u2019ve had in the five years in investment banking and in sales and trading, and we are doing that with a smaller balance sheet, fewer people, and lower value at risk or VAR.  So growth in deepening, all consistent with our responsible growth strategy continues across all the customer bases. Paul will talk to you more about the statistics and its successes. Another question that we get asked is can credit remain this strong? Well many of you asked that last quarter and the quarter before that and the quarter before that. And in this quarter, it\u2019s still got better again with our charge-off ratio decline to 40 basis points this quarter at an historic low.  This is driven by changes we made right after the crisis, thinking 2008 and 2009 and the long term benefits of that effort continue to come through. And by the way, sticking to our responsible growth strategy, even as times have been relatively better.  US consumer health is generally good. Over the past few quarters, exposures in our oil and gas that were causing industry concerns for commercial losses have improved, and charge-offs have receded. Other commercial credit remains very strong and Paul will touch on these topics later.  Another question we get asked is, what can we do to drive earnings even if we stay in this low rate, low growth environment? We aren\u2019t waiting for interest rates to rise here at Bank of America. We are driving our earnings growth now. We work on the things that we can control, expenses, loan and deposit growth, and fee growth. Long-term rates are down compared to last year, yet earnings have grown. Despite that, net interest income is up 3% from third quarter \u201915, while net interest yield has been stable because we grew core loans and deposits. Paul will take you through the loan growth details later, but I want to pause a moment and talk about our deposit growth. Deposits are core part of what drives our franchise earnings. We have 1.2 trillion of deposits that\u2019s proof the customers entrust us to safeguard their money. We are heavily weighted and mix those deposits towards consumers, whether they are general consumers or wealthy consumers. This in turn provides a very stable base of funding for the company and allows us to be less relied on the markets we are funding.  Nearly $450 billion or 36% of our deposits are non-interest bearing, a very strong mix. Deposits on average grew $68 billion year-over-year or 6%. The teams have done tremendous work here, and this quarter wasn\u2019t an anomaly. This is the fourth quarter consecutive quarter where we have grown deposits more than $50 billion over the previous year.  Our commercial teams remain focused on growing deposits also. They\u2019re growing deposits that are LCR friendly and doing great work with our industry leading cash management capabilities. As a result, year-over-year global banking grew their deposits 3% to 300 billion.  Our consumer and wealth management teams combine have $860 billion in deposits. They grew this large base by 8% in the past 12 months. For the first time, consumer tops $600 billion in deposits. These deposits are growing because our capabilities in the business are the best in the industry and our customers and clients see that. Whether it\u2019s our 21 million plus mobile banking customers, our 34 million plus online customers, or the more than 5 million customers that come in to our financial centers every week. These customers show that they appreciate the capabilities and integration of our network. So when we look at what else we can do to control and drive earnings in a low growth environment, we get asked a lot about expenses and can those expenses keep being driven down and go lower. Well the answer is yes. Last quarter we gave you a 2018 expense target and we continue to make progress towards that.  Our expenses declined 3% from the third quarter of 2015 to 2016. Our efficiency ratio improved 60% to 62% this quarter that is a 400 basis points improvement from last year\u2019s third quarter. We continue to deliver expense reductions while continuing to invest in technology and sales teams and other matters are important for the futures franchise.  After taking in to account the addition of large bank FDIC assessment at the start of this quarter, expenses are also down on linked quarter basis, even as we continue to invest and absorb all the severance, regulatory, resolution planning and other repositioning cost to continue to reduce our operating cost.  We have been innovating in technology and will continue to do so to improve processes and eliminate the need for paper and humans handling that paper. Our simplified and improved initiatives continue to help drive those costs down, and that leads to the question we also get asked. Can we deliver and sustain returns above our cost of capital?  As Lee talked about earlier, we restate our results to change under FAS 91 and reduce the variability and make us more comparable to peers. As you can see that makes a little easier to see the longer term return on tangible common equity trends. This quarter we reported 10.3% and it is now stabilized above the cost of capital even given our larger and larger capital base.  We still have work to do here to drive to our ultimate goals, and this quarter is another strong step in that direction. And importantly on slide 4, you can see that each business has improved its leverage. They grew their earnings, had strong efficiency and return far above the cost of capital. And all that continues to bode as we look ahead.  So as we look forward, we are driving responsible growth and maintaining discipline on cost, and this has allowed us to deliver more capital back to you, and we\u2019ll keep on doing that.  Now let me turn it over to Paul to cover the numbers. Paul? Paul Donofrio : Thanks Brian. Good morning everybody. Since Brian covered the income statement highlights, I will start with the balance sheet on page 5. Strong deposit growth drove a small increase in the size of our balance sheet versus Q2. Deposits rose 17 billion or 6% on an annualized basis.  During the quarter, long term debt fell by 5 billion. We put cash to work growing securities in our investment portfolio and more modestly through loan growth. Global equity sources rose driven by the positive growth, and we remain well compliant with LCR requirements. Tangible common equity of 174 billion improved by 2.8 billion from Q2, driven by earnings.  In the process, we returned 2.2 billion to common shareholders through a combination of dividends and 1.4 billion in share repurchases. On a per share basis, tangible book value increased to $17.14, up $1.60 or 11% from Q3 \u201915. I would note that this increase was driven by both retained earnings, as well as share repurchases below tangible book value as we reduced shares 3% from Q3, \u201915. Turning to regulatory metrics, as a reminder we report capital under the advanced approaches. Our CET 1 transition ratio under Basel III end of the quarter at 11%. On a fully phased-in basis, CET 1 capital improved $4 billion to $166 billion. Under the advanced approaches compared to Q2 \u201916, our CET 1 ratio increased 40 basis points to 10.9% and is well above our 10%, 2019 requirement. RWA declined roughly 20 billion, driven by reductions in global markets exposures and improvements in credit quality, driven by run-off of non-core legacy exposure. We also improved our capital metrics under the standardized approach. Here, our CET 1 ratio improved to 11.8%. Supplementary leverage ratios for both parent and bank continue to exceed US regulatory minimums to take effect in 2018. Turning to slide 6. On an average basis, total loans were up 23 billion or 3% from Q3 2015. And while up from Q2 \u201916, growth was at a slower pace. Consistent with past periods, we break out loans in our business segments and in all other. Year-over-year, loans in all other were down $30 billion, driven by continued run-off of first and second lien mortgages, while loans in our business segments were up $53 billion or 7%.  In consumer banking, we continue to see growth in residential real estate and vehicle lending offset somewhat by home equity pay-downs, which continued to outpace originations. In wealth management, we saw growth in residential real estate and structured lending. Global banking loans were up 26 billion or 8% year-over-year. On the bottom right of the chart, note the growth of 68 billion in average deposits that Brian mentioned.  Turning to asset quality on slide 7, we believe a number of factors including our strategy of responsible growth, enhanced underwriting standards since 2008, and a healthier economy have transformed the risk profile of Bank of America, as we look forward to future economic cycles.  Total net charge-offs of 888 million improved 97 million from Q2. Consumer losses declined across a number of products and commercial losses also declined, driven by lower energy losses. Driven by these improvements, provision expense of 850 million declined 126 million from Q2. We had a small overall net reserve release in the quarter as consumer real estate releases more than offset bills and other products.  On slide 8, we provide credit quality data on our consumer portfolio. We remain focused on originating consumer loans with borrowers with high FICO scores and our asset quality remained strong. Net charge-offs declined 71 million from Q2. This improvement was broadbased across consumer real estate as well as credit card.  Note that credit cards account for more than two-thirds of losses in our consumer portfolio, and within our US credit card book, the loss rate improved to 2.45%. NPLs improved and reserve coverage remained strong. Moving to commercial credit on slide 9, net charge-offs of 110 million improved 26 million from Q2. With respect to energy, exposures are down, losses improved, oil prices have stabilized and we have $1 billion of reserves. More specifically, energy charge-offs of 45 billion decreased 34 billion from Q2.  While reservable criticized declined from Q2, we did experience an increase in NPLs this quarter, which concentrated with two clients, one in metals and mining and one in energy. Overall, our commercial portfolio continues to perform well. As I shared with you last quarter, the metrics in the commercial portfolio speak for themselves in terms of quality and performance. The reservable criticized exposure declined and as a percentage of loans remains low. The commercial net charge-off ratio is 10 basis points. Excluding small business it is 5 basis points and it has been around 15 basis points or better for 15 consecutive quarters. And the NPL ratio remains low at 45 basis points. Turning to slide 10, net interest income on a GAAP non-FTE basis was 10.2 billion, 10.4 billion on an FTE basis. As Lee mentioned earlier, we changed our accounting method for the amortization of premium or discount paid on certain of our debt securities from the prepayment method to the contractual method. The contractual method is used by our peers and should make it easier for investors to make comparisons.  Compared to Q3; \u201815, NII is up 3 million or 3%, as loan growth are shorter than rates and higher security balances funded by deposits more than offset the negative impact of generally lower long-end rates over the past several quarters.  Okay with respect to assets sensitivity as of 9/30, an instantaneous 100 basis point parallel increase in rates is estimated to increase NII by 5.3 billion over the subsequent 12 months. This is lower than the sensitivity we reported at June 30. The reduction was mostly on the long end, driven by the change to the contractual method and slower prepaid speed based upon on recent trends in customer behavior. Note that this sensitivity on the short end at 3.3 billion has not changed significantly.  Turning to slide 11, non-interest expense was 13.5 billion, that $0.5 billion lower or 3% lower than Q3 \u201915 driven cost reductions across the company. This is the initial quota of the increased FDIC assessment to show off the deposit insurance fund, the increase in expense for us is roughly a $100 million per quarter. Compared to Q2 \u201916, expenses were stable, as good core expense control was offset by the higher FDIC cost and modestly higher incentives. Q3 litigation expense was 250 million, which is fairly consistent with both Q3, \u201915 as well as Q2 \u201916. Most expense categories were lower year-over-year. This trend was led by personnel expense, which includes the Q4 \u201915 exploration of the full amortized advisor awards in wealth management. The rest of the improvement was driven by reduced cost of mortgage servicing coupled with same efforts in other initiatives. Our employee base is down 3% from Q2 \u201915.  While the overall headcount is down, it\u2019s important to note that year-over-year we added over 1,000 primary sales associates across consumer, wealth management and global banking. Turning to the business segments and starting with consumer banking on slide 12. Consumer earned 1.8 billion continuing its trend of solid results and reporting a robust 21% return on allocated capital.  I would note that pre-tax, pre-provision earnings rose 377 million or 10%. Expense and NII improvement were both notable and together enough to more than offset higher provision expense and prior year divestiture gains.  Revenue was relatively flat on a reported basis compared to Q3 \u201915, as 4% growth in NII was offset as I said, by the absence of approximately 200 million of divestiture gains in Q3 \u201915. As a reminder these gains in Q3 \u201915 resulted from divestitures of an ancillary appraisal business, a card portfolio and some financial centers.  Excluding those prior period gains, revenue improved year-over-year and growth in pre-tax, pre-provisioned earnings was even more substantial. Falling 400 basis points, consumer banker\u2019s efficiency ratio of 55% improved meaningfully year-over-year.  Turning to slide 13 and key trends, first on the upper left the stats are a reminder of our strong competitive position. Looking a little closer at revenue drivers compared to Q3 \u201915, net interest income continue to improve as we drove deposits higher. Average deposits continued their strong growth up 50 billion or 9% year-over-year, outpacing the industry.  With respect non-interest income, service charges were up modestly, while card income was down. Spending levels and issuance were strong, but revenue growth was muted by customer rewards. We are attracting relatively higher quality card customers that on the one hand have higher spending habits, but on the other hand receive more awards. This has two important benefits to note; first, rewards deepen relationships, helping to grow deposits and make them more sticky for example. Second, in our experience, these customers have lower lost rates and a reduced need to interact with call centers, thereby allowing us to lower costs.  Turning to expenses, they declined 7% from Q3 \u201915 despite the higher FDIC assessment charges in the quarter. Expense reductions are the result of a number of initiatives. For example, mobile banking penetration helps to optimize our delivery network, while improving customer satisfaction. More chip cards help us lower fraud cost and digitization of processes and statements helps us eliminate paper and related handling cost. One can observe the impacts of these types of initiatives on the cost of deposits which continued its March lower dropping below 1.6% this quarter. Focusing on client balances on the left, in addition to deposit growth, Merrill Edge brokers assets at a 138 billion are up 18% versus Q3 \u201915 on strong account flows and market valuations.  We also increased the number of Merrill Edge accounts by 11% from Q3 \u201915. We now have nearly 1.7 million households that leverage our financial solution advisors and self-directed investing platform.  Moving across the bottom right of the page, note that loans are up 7% from Q3 \u201915 on strong mortgage and vehicle lending growth. As we viewed in previous quarters, we continue to focus on originating high FICO score loans, which have generally produced low loss rates and strong risk adjusted returns.  Loan growth included consumer real estate production of 20.4 billion, up 21% from Q3 \u201915 and in line with Q2 \u201916 as customers continue to take advantage of historically low interest rates. We retained about three quarters of first mortgage production on the balance sheet this quarter. Average vehicle loans were up 17% from Q3 \u201915 with average book FICO scores remaining well above 750 and net losses remaining below 30 basis points. With respect to US consumer card, average balances grew 7% from Q2 on an annualized basis, aided by seasonal backed school lending. We issued more than 1.3 million cards in the quarter and spending on credit cards adjusted for divestitures was up 8% compared to Q3 \u201915.  Turning to slide 14 in digital banking trends, as I mentioned earlier, we continue to see strong momentum in digital banking adoption with use across service, appointments and sales. Mobile banking in transforming how our customers bank and reshaping our consumer segment. Importantly as adoption rises, particularly around transaction processing and self-service, we see improved efficiency and customer satisfaction.  We continue to improve capabilities with the latest example being the launch of our Spanish mobile app which attracted over 800,000 active users in the first 10 weeks. We added roughly 1.1 million new mobile users in the quarter. The pace of user growth has increased despite an already impressive penetration rate of our check-in account holders.  With more than 21.3 million active users, deposit from mobile devices now represents 18% of deposit transactions, and 26 million checks were deposited via mobile devices this quarter. That is an average of 280,000 deposits per day, an increase of 27% year-over-year and the equivalent to volume of 830 financial centers. Digital sales now represent 18% of total sales, and we now have more than 3500 digital ambassadors in our financial centers driving further adoption. Also as you know, we are a leader in person-to-person and person-to-business money movement through digital transfers and bill payment capabilities. Consumers moved 243 billion in Q3 up 6% from last year, and while all this is transformative, I would just remind you that we still have a little less than 1 million per day walking in to our centers across the US. This in-person interaction is important in terms of deepening and retaining personal relationships, providing more complex financial help, and creating opportunities for further engagement.  Turning to slide 15, global wealth and investment management produced earnings of 697 million, up 10% from Q3 \u201915. Now it\u2019s no secret that this segment operates in an industry undergoing meaningful change as firms and clients adapt to the new fiduciary rules and other market dynamics. The good news is, we start from a position of strength with 2.5 trillion in client balances. We have market leading brands and a wide range of investment service offers from self-service to fully managed, plus we have the resources to continue to invest in market leading capabilities that address the changing needs of our clients.  Year-over-year, revenue is down modestly, but expenses were down even more improving pre-tax margin to 25%, up meaningfully from Q3 \u201915. Overall revenue declined 2% from Q3 \u201915, as NII growth was more than offset by lower transactional revenues. NII benefitted from solid loan and deposit growth, non-interest income declined from Q3 \u201915,driven lower transactional revenue that continues to be impacted by market factors as well as migration of activities from brokerage to managed relationships. Non-interest expense declined nearly 313 million or 6% from Q3 \u201915, with half of that benefit derived from the exploration of the amortization of advisor retention award that were put in place at the time of the Merrill Lynch merger. The rest of the improvement was a result of work across many categories of expense, more than offsetting higher FDIC cost.  Moving to slide 16; we continue to see overall solid client engagement, client balances approached 2.5 trillion and are up from Q2 including higher market valuations, 10 billion of long term AUM flows and continued loan and deposit growth.  Average deposits compared against Q3 \u201915 are up 4%, driven by growth in the second half of 2015. Compared to Q2, average deposits were impacted by seasonal tax payments. Average loans were up 7% year-over-year, growth remained concentrated in consumer real estate and structured lending.  Lastly, earlier this month, we announced some innovations to our IRA products and services which we believe position us to better serve our clients, given new fiduciary rules. These innovations are industry-leading and address not only the new fiduciary rules for time and accounts, but also client preference for more choice and new ways to invest.  First, we announced the roll-out of a new offering called Merrill Edge guided investing. This solution offers clients online investing, enhanced with professional portfolio management. With the addition of this solution, clients have three fundamental choices which they can mix and match to best meet their needs.  Clients can invest online, completely self-directed through Merrill Edge or if they are interested in enhanced professional portfolio management, they will be able to use Merrill Edge guided investing, or they can chose fully advised working one-on-one with the financial advisor via brokerage or fee based advisory platforms. We also announced at the beginning in April 2017 for clients that chose to have a financial advisor provide advice with respect to their IRA accounts, we will provide this service through our fee based advisory platform Merrill Lynch One, as we believe this is the best way for us to deliver for IRA clients who chose to have this level of service and advice.  Clients will also have the option to invest their retirement through Merrill Edge either completely self-directive or through Merrill Edge guided investing.  Turning to slide 17, global banking earned 1.6 billion which is up 22% year-over-year. Q3 reflects good revenue growth, solid cost control and solid client activity. The efficiency ratio improved to 45% in Q3.  Compared to previous third quarters, the investment banking fees this quarter were the highest since the merger with Merrill in 2009. Return on allocated capital was 17%, a 300 basis points improvement from Q3 \u201915, despite adding a couple of billion dollars of allocated capital this year.  Global banking continues to drive loan growth within its risk and client frameworks producing solid year-over-year improvement at NII. Revenue growth also benefited from roughly a 175 million from gains on [NPL] this quarter versus loses in Q3 \u201915. Higher treasury fees also added to revenue growth.  A decrease in non-interest expense compared to Q3 \u201915, reflects good expense control that offset modestly higher revenue related compensation and higher FDIC costs.  Looking at the trends on slide 18 and comparing to Q3 last year, average loans on a year-over-year basis grew 26 billion or 8%. Growth was broad based across large corporates as well as middle market borrowers and diversified across most products. Having said that, as we noted last quarter the pace of commercial loan growth has slowed over the past couple of quarters, demand across the industry appears have slowed as well.  We remain diligent in certain sectors such as commercial real estate and energy, and we are also closely monitoring certain international regions. Average deposits increased from Q3 \u201915, up 10 billion or 3% from both new and existing clients. As we grow treasury services, we remain focused on quality deposits with respect to LCR. Switching to global markets on slide 19, let me start by reviewing what I said last quarter, regarding this segment. The past few quarters are examples of the importance of this segment to not only its clients around the world, but also to the customers and clients of all our business segments.  Again this quarter, global markets delivered for clients by helping them raise capital, buying self-securities, as well as manage risk. We continue to invest in and enjoy leadership positions across a broad range of products. We believe this improves the sustainability of our revenue and makes us more relevant to clients across the globe.  We\u2019ve been there for clients when they needed us across all these products. Our results this quarter reflect the strategy and continue commitment to clients. Global markets spent 1.1 billion and returned 12% on allocated capital. Revenue was up appreciably year-over-year and even outpaced typical seasonality by posting modest improvement over Q2 \u201916.  Total revenue excluding DVA was up 20% year-over-year on solid sales and trading results, which rose 18%. It\u2019s worth noting we achieved these result with slightly less balance sheet, lower VAR and 7% fewer people. Continued expense discipline drove cost 1% lower year-over-year as increases in revenue related incentives were more than offset by reductions in operating and support costs.  Moving to trends on slide 20 and focusing on the components of our sales and trading performance; sales and trading revenue of 3.7 billion excluding DVA was up 18% from Q3 \u201915, driven by FICC.  In terms of revenue, this was the best third quarter in five years. Excluding DVA and versus Q3 \u201915, FICC sales and trading of 2.8 billion increased 39% as we built momentum as the quarter progressed across a host of credit products and continued gains in rates products. Mortgages showed particular strength among credit products, as investors sought yield. Equity sales and trading were solid at $1 billion in revenue, but declined 17% versus Q3 \u201915, which benefitted from higher levels of market volatility and client activity. On slide 21 we present all other, which recorded a net loss of 180 million. This loss includes a previously disclosed tax charge of 350 million due to the third quarter UK enactment of tax rate reduction, which reduced the value of our UK DTI.  A loss in the current period compares to earnings of a 152 million in Q3 \u201915 as lower security gains and higher expense litigation offset higher mortgage banking revenue. MBI revenue this quarter includes 280 million benefits from higher valuations on our MSR driven by slower expected prepaid speeds based upon recent observed trends and customer behavior. Let me offer a few takeaways as I finish. We reported solid results this quarter that were consistent with our strategy responsible growth. We remain focused on delivering responsible growth as well as strengthening and simplifying Bank of America.  Capital and liquidity strengthened, asset quality remained strong. We grew revenue, we grew deposits, we grew loans, we delivered for clients in capital markets, we lowered costs. We invested in our future by adding sales professionals and deploying technology that helps the customers better live their financial lives and improves satisfaction. And importantly, we returned more capital to our shareholders.  With that lets open up to questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] we\u2019ll take our first question from John McDonald with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Your line is open. John McDonald : Just wanted to ask about expenses, could you talk about what kind of timing expectations you have under various projects helping to drive down your expenses further in 2017 and \u201918, maybe just remind us what are some of the big items that you\u2019re working on and should we still think about 53 billion in 2018 as kind of your hard target that you\u2019re shooting for. Paul Donofrio : Well let me start with the last part first, nothing has changed at all for our thoughts regarding the 2018 target that we discussed in the second quarter call. Again, I would note that, year-over-year we\u2019ve reduced expenses by $0.5 billion. And I would also just point out to remind everybody that if you look at expenses over a longer term, we reduced quarterly expenses ex litigation by 4.8 billion from Q3 \u201911, that\u2019s a 19 billion run rate. So if you think about what we have to do between and 2018, I think we talked about this before, roughly a third of that is going to come from continued progress on delinquent loan servicing. The other two-thirds is going to come from a lot of different initiatives across the company. We\u2019ve talked about same or simplify an improved initiative. We\u2019re going to be utilizing technology to digitize processes, eliminating handling cost. We\u2019re going to get technology efficiencies from our datacenters consolidation and from more efficient servers. As I said, we\u2019re going to continue to make progress on delinquent loan servicing cost, hopefully see some modest improvement on litigation. A very important part of this is the shift to self-served digital channels, mobile, online, ATM. So that\u2019s what the list sounds like and it goes on and on.  I would emphasizes this shift to self-serve. We\u2019re seeing good momentum with more than 21 million mobile banking active users and that\u2019s growing every week, every month. 18% of our deposit transactions are now completed through mobile devices, that\u2019s better for customers, it\u2019s also better for our shareholders. It\u2019s one-tenth the cost of walking into a branch. So it\u2019s all these things kind of put together, it\u2019s initiatives across the whole company. It\u2019s going to come a lot from support and operations, but there\u2019s a little bit in the front office as well as we get more efficient. John McDonald : In terms of the timing Paul, is it something that we should think of as ramping throughout 2017, and is it longer tail at the end. Can you give us a sense there? Paul Donofrio : I would say it\u2019s going to be fairly spread out throughout the whole process, however, as you think about one quarter over next, it\u2019s not going to be straight down every quarter. Not every quarter is the same, there is going to be some lumpiness. Let\u2019s look at the fourth quarter for example, we traditionally have some seasonality in the fourth quarter, so generally we\u2019ll make progress, but don\u2019t expect that you\u2019re going to see it in every single quarter. John McDonald : And then a second question just quickly on net interest income. Can you help us try to translate your 100 basis points rate sensitivity into something closer to what one fed hike might do for your net interest income, and what would be the trajectory of NII and NIM if we did get a fed hike this quarter? What would you expect more in the near term next quarter too on NII and NIM? Paul Donofrio : I can help you through that. So if you look about 25 basis points that would be one quarter of our 5.3 billion in sensitivity. If you want to assume that 25 basis points increases the long end by 25 basis points, you kind of know the answer. You can roughly take a quarter of it, perhaps even a little bit more because we\u2019re probably more asset sensitive on the first 25 and the last 25 of that 100.  But if you don\u2019t want to increase on the long end, just look at the short end we\u2019ve disclosed. It\u2019s 3.3 billion, you could divide that by 4 and get a pretty good sense of what 25 basis points would do over the subsequent 12 months. Operator : And we\u2019ll take next question from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Glenn Schorr : Just curious for point of clarification, Brian had mentioned global markets, feels like it\u2019s taken a little share. Alluded to global peers restructuring, completely get it, believe it\u2019s going to happen. Just curious if you can give a little color on where you might see some of that evidence taking shape product, [indiscernible] whatever? Paul Donofrio : I\u2019ll try to do that, but let me just start with a couple of thoughts. First of all, I think it\u2019s difficult to see share shifts in global markets in any given quarter. Fee pools are just not as transparent as they are, and let\u2019s say invest banking fees or other areas. What we know is client activity was up in the third quarter and that\u2019s what drives our short term results.  Over the longer term, it\u2019s easier just to assess what\u2019s going on with fee pools and share. So, I just want to point out from \u201914 to \u201915 on declining fee pools, we\u2019re pretty sure we improved our share, third parties tell us that. And I think that share has come from a number of regions and a number of firms and a number of products as competitors adjust their strategies and capabilities.  More specifically we\u2019ve been investing in rates, but for a number of years, I think we\u2019re making some progress there. We have a very strong credit platform as you know, I think we\u2019re making progress there relative to the competitors around the world, and I think we\u2019re investing in equities, and I think your equities revenue is down, but I think you\u2019re seeing improvement relative to the fee pool and equities as well. I do want to emphasize very importantly that our strategy is to have a diversified product portfolio across both FICC and equities and globally. That\u2019s what our clients need and want from us, and so you could see gains one quarter and one place and see something lower in another place, and that\u2019s okay with us. That\u2019s our strategy. It\u2019s about what the client needs in any given quarter. If we\u2019re doing a little bit worse in one place, we\u2019re probably doing better in another place. Glenn Schorr : Fair enough nature of the business, I guess. One another one, and I appreciate all the color on the different products and what you\u2019re doing on the wealth management. The curious move in the quarter was the move away from the commission based IRAs, and I\u2019m curious, is that more specifically done to avoid the best interest contract. I\u2019m just curious based on how we roll forward, if the SEC comes in, what that might mean. You talked about giving customer choice, but this sounds like less choice for the FA. Paul Donofrio : Look, clients are going to have three ways to invest in their IRA, they\u2019re going to do it completely, self-direct to Merrill Edge. They are going to be able to do it online, but enhance with professional portfolio managed through Merrill Edge guide and investing. And again for those clients who want one on one advice and service from their FA, they\u2019re going to be able to do that on a fee based advisory platform.  What we\u2019ve decided not to do is use the best interest exemption to allow IRA accounts to be added to our brokerage platform where clients pay on a transaction basis. After reviewing all our options, let\u2019s say, if a client choses one on one advice and service on her IRA, we believe the best way to provide that advice is through Merrill Lynch One on our fee based advisory platform. We took a lot of time to make this decision. We took months thinking about this, we did research. We believe this is in the best interest of our client and our advisors. Glenn Schorr : I don\u2019t doubt that, I worry about just the execution of it. I\u2019m assuming it means that the advisor has to talk to the client and explain this whole thing and just --. Paul Donofrio : Yeah, that\u2019s right. But the advisors are going to be tough to their clients and explain the best interest exemption. That\u2019s going to be a much harder compensation than the one we\u2019re going to have. Operator : And we\u2019ll take the next question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Betsy Graseck : Couple questions, just one on loan growth, could you give us a sense as to how you think you\u2019re trajecting there. We talked a little bit about market share and trading. Could we talk a little bit about how you think you\u2019re doing in the lending side of the equation and if there\u2019s any like there. Brian Moynihan : We feel good about loan growth, the economy feels good. So we are confident that we can grow. But of course there\u2019s going to be some uncertainty, and as I said in certain sectors and certain regions around the world. I would remind you that we are focused on responsible growth. So, in some of those, we\u2019re going to look a little bit different than some of our competitors in some places, but we feel good. Year-over-year if you look at our business segments, we had 7% loan growth. Betsy Graseck : One of the areas that I just wanted to dig in a little bit more to is on the mortgage side where you have had some loan growth, but I\u2019m just wondering if there is more opportunity there as it relates to either taking some duration exposures or on credit as you\u2019ve moved in to some wider credit boxes with my first home which is insure by Fannie and Freddie, but just want to get some color on that. Brian Moynihan : Betsy if you go to page six of the materials you can see that we\u2019re continuing in the mortgage area overall, so thinks both in home equity and first mortgage loan. You can see that we continue to run off some of that non-core portfolio and overall the balances grow in the business segment, and we expect that to continue. We\u2019re doing about 2,000 applications a day, we\u2019ve got a 1,000 each plus in each of the products that have continued to grow. And so we\u2019ll continue to drive that core capability to the customer.  In terms of expansion of product sets, we have a limited product that we built for some of the 3% down payment for $0.5 billion a year for production just to give us a more competitive product there but limited to size, and we\u2019ll do some other things. But we\u2019re going to stick with the core credit.  Remember who you\u2019re talking to her Betsy. In our experience the mortgage is probably deeper than most people. So we will stick with what our customers need and what we think the right but for the company is. Betsy Graseck : Okay, so as you\u2019re thinking about your revenue growth from here, which are the three key legs that you expect are going to keep that revenue growth growing. Brian Moynihan : I think if you think about the growth, you\u2019ve got the side and you\u2019ve got the fee side and if you think about the interest side it\u2019s going to be driven by balanced growth between loans and deposits, and I think we keep growing deposits every year $60 billion we\u2019re paying four basis points in consumer and think about that dynamic and putting that to work in anything we can is important, and we continue to grow loans at less rate than we grow (inaudible). If that\u2019s going to drive our NIM, it\u2019s just a bigger and bigger, lower and lower cost deposit base. And on the loan side, I think consumers growing better now than commercial in linked quarter, but overall we expect commercial will get back in a little bit as the economy continues and some of the uncertainty listed in the political season here.  So on loans and deposits, it will just be growing out. As you\u2019ve seen year-over-year, our core growth is 7% on loans and growth on deposits. On the fee side, what you\u2019re seeing is the dynamic and its specially fee areas finally turn a little bit stable and then turning for us in the card revenue and things like that, which would hit sort of the inflexion point where the run down and relative interchange due to selling some portfolios and getting out of non-core portfolios and putting on the core portfolios with rewards attached to which helps us generate deposit and things like that is stabilizing and starting to see in the last few quarters, card income starting to move up a bit. And on services charges it\u2019s been relatively stable. So the fee side will be driven more by wealth management and markets and things like that and consumers\u2019 stable which is good because it had been a drag for a long time. Betsy Graseck : And then on the expense side, you indicate all of the various technology efforts that you\u2019ve got underway, but is there more that you can do on the comp side as well? Brian Moynihan : When we have less people going through our bonus pools and stuff, so you can see the comp continue to drift down. A large part of the comp obviously is the wealth management business which there\u2019s no meaningful changes there, but in the other businesses we continue as we have less people, we continue to reduce that as a percentage of revenue. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead. Jim Mitchell : Maybe you could talk a little bit about the credit cycle, I think one of the major pushback from investors is that we\u2019re going to start to see credit at worse. But I think you guys are pretty clear that you are not lowering standards to drive growth. So how do you think about the cycle from here, like I said at the start? Brian Moynihan : I think I said it earlier, if you think about the last several quarters of earnings call, it\u2019s not going to get any better than this and every quarter it gets slightly better and that in part is because we\u2019re still getting the benefits of the changes made six, seven, eight years ago coming through the consumer business i.e. that what we call back book portfolios or legacy portfolios or whatever word you want to use continue to run-off with higher credit risk and we keep putting and have put on and continue to put on higher credit quality.  So if you think about overall charge-offs of 880 this quarter, that\u2019s driven by the consumer business and that\u2019s driven by the card and some in legacy home equities. And so keeping the card business where we wanted is critical and you\u2019re seeing us continue, even as we start to see that portfolio both nominally and rate the charge-off picture strong.  So when you go back and look at what happened during the crisis the charge-offs came abnormally from the edges of credit and we\u2019ve kept ourselves out of that. Jim Mitchell : So you feel like you can keep at least ratios as you grow pretty stable? Brian Moynihan : We have done that. Jim Mitchell : And just maybe follow-up on the capital ratios, while also that the [RTB] ways drops while the balance sheet grew a little bit. So it seems like you reduced risk. Where was that and can that continue? Paul Donofrio : Yeah, now you\u2019re speaking about the advanced approaches we had dropped. We have it under standardized as well just late last. And that drop came again from legacy portfolios running off, and from a continued work by our goal markets team to better manage their balance sheet relevant to those ratios. Jim Mitchell : Is there any more detail or can you get a little more from here? Paul Donofrio : Yeah, there\u2019s always more to do, and we are focused on a lot of different regulatory metrics, and we\u2019re looking at all of them where there are some maybe a little bit more important than others right now and we are focused on all of them. And I think there\u2019s more to come there. Obviously as we grow balance sheet, as we grow loans and deposits, we are going to continue to see some increase particularly on the standardize side. But relative to that growth we can continue to make a little bit of progress incrementally. Operator : And our next question comes from Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Matt O\u2019Connor: Can you talk about the strategy within the securities book? You did mention that you added some later in the quarter, and obviously deposit growth has been exceeding loan growth to justify that. But give some color in terms of what you are buying, the duration, and how to make sure it doesn't get too big relative to the size of the balance sheet. Paul Donofrio : Yeah Matt you pick up on the (inaudible) and the drives. We have a securities portfolio because we have more deposits coming in that we have loans. So our view of that portfolio is, we don\u2019t take credit risk there and so we have two alternatives treasuries and mortgage backed securities or cash I guess is the third. And so that\u2019s how we invested and Paul can take you through his earlier comments a little bit and give you some color on that. But I think people always have to remember, the reason why we have more is because our deposits grew at $60 billion year-over-year and that\u2019s more than our loans grew by quite a bit. So Paul you want to answer or give some color on that. Paul Donofrio : Sure. Just one step back, obviously what we\u2019re doing every day is managing earnings, capital, liquidity and interest rate risk. We think that portfolio and where we want to invest things. This quarter as you noted, our deposit growth exceeded our loan growth, and so we did add significantly to the investment portfolio. Most of that incremental amount we devoted to treasuries, just as we think about the balance in that portfolio, we wanted just to add a little bit more treasuries. That\u2019s really kind of it. Matt O\u2019Connor: And then a little bit related, but on the deposit side, obviously a very strong growth year-over-year, you mentioned $60 billion and really little to no repricing despite the one bump in fed rates that should impact the year-over-year comp. So, I guess the question is, if we do get a rate increase, do you think you\u2019ve got more flexibility to limit the possible pricing given its basically worked so far and loan growth has obviously not enough to absorb the deposit growth you have. Brian Moynihan : Remember that the reason why you don\u2019t see much repricing is really two or three dynamics. One is, a 450 billion of our deposits are non-interest bearing. So they aren\u2019t going to reprice. The great debate is about how sticky are those. And if you think about that, and there\u2019s a dominate by our consumer business and our non-interest bearing accounts and consumer have doubled in size over the last five or six years due to focusing on primary accounts in the house or where they run their household finances through our account and therefore the correct deposit are check and things like that. So, the first thing the number are [1 trillion] to 450 non-interest bearing and a dominant part of that consumer and also in the wealth management, (inaudible) transactional count of both consumers and then on the business side similarly we have driven our deposits to be really LCR friendly and core operating accounts. And so those aren\u2019t going to move, the non-interest bearing aren\u2019t going to move much and the big debate is how much balance will be there and we feel confident that the balances will stay just because of the nature of the accounts.  And then when you go to the second dynamic, remember with all those deposit growth, one of the things we continue to do and the impact less and less is we are expecting consumer business running off CD still at a fairly decent cliff that were historically used to fund prior companies, balance sheets that we don\u2019t need the funding that caused.  So we have some roll over, but that continues to decline, that weighted average cost drops off and that cost drops off and it drives down or holds steady the weighted average cost. And then if you look at money and other interest bearing they really haven\u2019t moved much. So we feel good about the consumer, we forget base overall. We feel very good about the consumer deposit base just cross 600 billion for the first time in the company\u2019s history and consumers generally, and with that I think if rates rise, we think that it is substantial value for the company and Paul gave you what you think about that earlier with a quarter of 3.3 billion, 25% of 3.3 billion. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Ken Usdin : Wanted to ask about the card business a little bit, I saw in the deck that you grew card issuance at the fastest level since 2008. And there is a burden on the fee side with reward stuff and balances are still flat. I was wondering if you could walk us forward and help us understand a little bit better just the ROA and income direction of the card business? When do we start to see that show up in both balances, and when do expect to see that fee growth come along for the ride, given the good underlying growth that we haven't quite seen yet in the financials? Paul Donofrio : I think you\u2019re noticing some modest card balance growth in the quarter, which we think will continue as we add new accounts and again we\u2019re very focused on adding high quality accounts there. I think you probably also noticed that while combined debit and credit card spend was good in the quarter at 5%, 6% of it could fuel, I\u2019m adjusting for our divestitures last year that the growth in the card camp was impacted by customer reward programs.  However just focusing on the fee income, this is some really key benefits of our strategy which is a track relatively higher quality card customers reward them for deepening their overall relationship with us. This strategy really drives deposit growth and makes deposits stickier, plus we believe these customers have little loss rates, they used to (inaudible) which helps us lower cost. I think when you want to see the effect of this, you have to look at the overall consumer segment and what\u2019s going on there in terms of growth of profits and improvement in expenses. And lastly I just point out, our risk adjusted margins on card are stronger and over 9%. This is in no way a signal that we are not going to be able to grow the card income line. I just want to get a better sense of how we think about it. Brian Moynihan : I think if you think about that more broadly, we had the last divestitures of size we made in this card business were the fourth quarter of last year, and now through the P&L. So you were through the balances and through the things. And what you\u2019re starting to see if you look at the trends this year, you\u2019re starting to see positive movement both in card income and in balances as we move across the year and we expect that to continue. It will be strong responsible growth and one of the great debates we have in the company as people say why can\u2019t you grow this faster or we\u2019re giving up too much in the interchange for the preferred balance the preferred rewards. The interesting question is, are you giving up something you\u2019d never have in the preferred rewards i.e. we\u2019re bringing more customer relationship in debt and that gets us something. So incrementally the net interchange is actually there as oppose to what theoretically get gross interchange with a non-customer in the (inaudible) program. So, we focus on entire customer relationship. It is very valuable, it is very powerful. And believe me if we could grow faster responsibly we would. But the idea is just to grind up a slow and steady growth and we\u2019re starting to see that come through and largely it was massed in \u201914-\u201915 and behind that those areas, because we are divesting a lot non-core relationships and now we have synergy one and we have the core card business we wanted. Paul Donofrio : And again you can see it if you look at the whole segment. I\u2019m also comparing us to peers, but just take a look at our PP&R year-over-year it fell 10%. Ken Usdin : Understood. Second quick question is you mentioned that you are now achieving the cost of capital in an ROE above 10% and capital is just still building. Do you think you can continue to hold does not improve the ROE as capital will likely continue to grow, presuming that you still will get those benefits going forward, and you are not at the point of returning more than 100% of your earnings yet? Brian Moynihan : Well I think embedded in that the future return of capital and we now have a significant buffer above the requirements. And as Paul said, we continue to optimize our requirement. So I think you\u2019re little bit of a horse race between increasing earnings and increasing capital and as we return more you expect that the horse race increasing earnings would stay ahead of it. But we\u2019ve got room to go and we\u2019re driving at it. But if we don\u2019t hit - the issue is that our capital continues to grow that capital is also used as investor and continues to go under our book value and so it\u2019s not going anywhere. It\u2019s there to be returned when we can get through the process of getting from where we are to higher percentages of capital return and ultimately returning excess capital. Paul Donofrio : And we have a goal to return more. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead. Mike Mayo : You've reduced your branch count from 6,000 to 4,600, where do you think that count can go? And on the one hand, we heard you say almost 1 million customers walk into branches each day, but on the other hand you have grown deposits 1.2 trillion. You did mention more self-service digital channels. You did mention mobile banking is 18% of the deposit transactions, and less reliance on the branches might ease any extra pressure to sell more products in this low rate environment. So where do you think you might take the branch count to, and I don't think you mentioned the impact of the cross-selling issues on Bank of America or if we wake up one day and find out that Bank of America did something inappropriate? Brian Moynihan : Well lets go to how we run our consumer business. We run our consumer business consistent with responsible growth for the company, and what that means is that you focus on deepening relationships what we call [stair stapler]. It\u2019s the core deposit account, the core credit card and getting it used in the core mortgage and the core home equity and the core auto loans that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been driving at and we continue to drive that and that\u2019s the backbone of what we did and how we reposition this company over many years.  In terms of the branches, Mike, yeah you rounded off our statistics which Paul talked about earlier, but it is a complex optimization in it but it all starts with the consumer. What is the consumer going to do? And so while 18% of deposits were made by mobile, the deposits 82% by the very nature aren\u2019t. And where do they go? About 50 percentage points of that go through the ATM and about another 30% odd go through the teller line still today. And so you have to be ready and able to serve in all dynamics.  So what we continue to do is optimize the branch structure, the call structure, the ATM structure, the mobile structure and the online structure altogether. And the way to think about that optimization and why it is extremely important business to the company is that we\u2019ve gone from 300 basis points the cost of all that to deposits to about 150 over the last 6-7 years and that\u2019s by continuing to optimize the physical plan as well as all these other means. So if you ask me, your question is, how far you can you? You have to also then think about what we want to do monitor branch.  So if you look back at some of the statistics that Paul had in the deck for consumer, when you see things like appointment set up or 340,000 in the third quarter. So just think about, 340,000 times the customer went on a mobile phone and asked to come to a branch. So we need those branches to receive those mobile phone customers and why are they coming usually for much more important financial transaction to them then handing us a check for deposit. So it\u2019s a quality versus quantity and making sure we understand. So we are optimizing all those and you can see them on page 14 on the lower right, you can see different clues. I\u2019d say we went from 7 million visits probably 4-5 years ago to 6 to 5. But those 5 are of a higher quality, and we think that\u2019s important. And there are certain transactions and certain capabilities that you just have to have at your branch, and you just have to do it face to face, Very difficult things like, how to get a power of attorney for a parent that\u2019s sick or I want to do a mortgage, still difficult to do through the phone and things like that.  So we\u2019ll have all aspects, we drive it down and then you can see that we continue to make that progress.. Mike Mayo : I mean just as a follow-up and slide 14 is kind of saying Bank of America we're a [Thinktech] company and look how well we are doing, and you are showing some good growth rates. That chart on the upper right, so at what point does that lead to a greater number of branch reductions? Do you have the answer and you don't want to say for competitive or you don\u2019t know yet, it\u2019s kind of a give and take based on the customer experience. Some of your competitors talk about closing 100-200 branches per year, you reduced 112 over the last year, but it seems to be slowing. So I\u2019m trying to get a sense of that. Brian Moynihan : I\u2019d say that the point is that, we\u2019ve run this business and we start with the consumer and their activities and their behaviors. So what they want to do and the key is not to get ahead of them, because that can cause you problems and not to be behind them because that can be cost issues and empty branches. So even in the 112 we\u2019re down we\u2019ve added branches in places like Denver. The Denver branch that we\u2019re adding are top 10% of performing branches today on relationship building. We\u2019ve added branches in Manhattan, we\u2019ve added branches in Minneapolis. And so we\u2019re in a sea change in terms of what the branches look like individually. The new branches are different.  We\u2019re adding branches we didn\u2019t have, we\u2019re closing branches where the utilization isn\u2019t there. The nature of how far a customer will travel is also different now than it was 10-15 years ago. I think you said what are all the different reasons? The answer is, I think you said we\u2019ll follow the customers and I don\u2019t know the exact number because I can tell you, eight years ago when we had 6100, there were people who said there was never going to be less branches in our system and maybe we should add more and guess what we\u2019re 4500. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Paul Miller with FBR & Company. Paul Miller : You guys took an MSR write-up or a hedging benefit; I can't really which one it is, about $360 million. But you did write up the MSR from 51 basis points to 60 basis points. Was that all rate driven, the 10 year did go up a little bit or was that also some better credit metrics out of the servicing portfolio? Paul Donofrio : We had a $280 million benefit this quarter and that was from a higher valuation of the MSR, which was due to slower observe pre-payment speeds. So we\u2019re just updating the way we value that. We have to monitor our - it\u2019s a level three asset, so there\u2019s a lot of things that go in to that. It\u2019s hard to value and you\u2019ve got to be continually looking at that valuation and we thought it was time based upon observation of pre-payment speeds to make a change in some key assumptions. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities. Eric Wasserstrom : I just wanted to follow up on a couple of questions related to the various consumer lending businesses. First, Paul just from your response to Ken's question a moment ago on card. I heard everything you said about the risk-adjusted margin and the credit quality of the portfolio, etcetera. But just to be clear, are you expecting improving, stable or deteriorating ROA based on the current competitive environment, because it seems like many peers are underscoring the near-term risks to profitability from awards and customer acquisition costs? Paul Donofrio : Look based upon how we\u2019re growing the business, how we\u2019re running the business we expect stability. Eric Wasserstrom : And with respect to mortgage, I saw there was about $100 million benefit from rep and warrant release. How much of that reserve still exists and what would be your expectations about potentially realizing it at this stage given where we are with respect to that issue? Paul Donofrio : The rep and warranty is counter revenue. So was that you were referring to? Eric Wasserstrom : Yes, correct. It's the provision line item. You had a negative provision. Paul Donofrio : So if that\u2019s going to bump around, that bumps around because --. Lee McEntire : Eric, it\u2019s Lee. I think what you\u2019re looking at what Paul is referring to is a contra revenue item, so it\u2019s a negative revenue item when its provision expense on the provision. Eric Wasserstrom : Maybe I will come back to you in a bit. Just finally on auto it seemed that some peers were signaling that competitive conditions in auto underwriting were easing a bit after intensifying over the past several quarters. Are you seeing anything like that across any particular segment of the FICO strata? Paul Donofrio : We\u2019re continuing to see good growth in consumer vehicle lending the way that we run the business. We\u2019re up roughly 7% or $7 billion or 17% year-over-year. Again we\u2019re focused on prime and super prime, so originations were down modestly Q3 versus the prior quarter as we accepted a little bit less dealer flow, but we still feel good about that product offering.  The third quarter average book FICO scores remained at approximately 770, debt-to-income was at all-time lows. We\u2019re not following the market expansion to 84 months in terms of tenure. We\u2019ve got a maximum tenure of 75 and I think in the third quarter we were averaging around 67. So we\u2019re getting the growth within our responsible growth framework and we feel good about it. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Steven Chubak with Nomura. Please go ahead. Steven Chubak : Want to kick things off with a follow-up to an earlier question on the DOL. Paul you had noted that Merrill FAs will no longer be permitted to engage in brokerage activities in retirement accounts. I was hoping you can give us an update as to what portion of Merrill client assets are currently in brokerage IRA, and maybe more specifically, how should we think about the net economic impact from transitioning some of those retirement assets into some of the other offerings that you highlighted, whether it be fee-based which should generate higher fees versus robo or self-directed Merrill Edge? Paul Donofrio : Sure. So the primary affected portion of our business is in the transaction brokerage retirement accounts. And if you look at our roughly 2 trillion of due inclined assets outside of loans and deposits, we would see the DOL rule having an impact on significantly less 10% of those balances. And again that\u2019s as the industry works towards the full implementation of the rule in January 18.  So as you noted, we\u2019re going to see some geography movement on the P&L. There\u2019s going to be some shifts, and if I had a guess today, we might see some modest revenue impact in 2017, but it\u2019s really kind of way too early to know how it\u2019s all going to shake out. But we would expect to mitigate that in subsequent years. Brian Moynihan : I think people, just Steven you talk about backing up for the fuller trends on wealth manager. There\u2019s been a constant decline in brokerage revenue over the years largely because it\u2019s really been in the industry and we have been moving more to a financial device to manage those account executions. And so in that broker - obviously a limited portion of that\u2019s IRA related in both counts, but the reality is this is against the backdrop that you\u2019ll see that brokerage number has been tough to chase for five years now. Steven Chubak : Got it, okay. And just one other quick follow-up on the same topic, the press article highlighted some of the changes that you've made indicated that some clients that would transition to the, \u201chigher touch advisory offerings\u201d will be rebated some incremental fees. I was wondering how are you planning to apply changes to the fee structure for those brokerage assets that do, in fact, transition. I'm just struggling to see how a two-tiered structure might work in practice across the hundreds of billions of assets that would be affected here? Brian Moynihan : I think the implementation has to be carefully handled. In the team Andy and John have been leaders in trying to figure this out the right way for the client and we start with what\u2019s best for the client. So what you\u2019re reading about is, there\u2019ll be adjustments made clients-by-clients basis in that circumstances and what they want from us, and FA\u2019s will engage in a lot of conversations about that as we go through the next several months. Steven Chubak : Okay, thanks Brian. Just one more on the topic of capital, just switching gears for a moment. Following (inaudible) recent remarks, there's one area of debate has been whether the Collins Floor would in fact apply to this new capital framework, i.e. whether you will be forced to manage to capital minimums under both the standardized and advanced approaches. Now that you've had some time to digest the initial release or guidance, I was wondering if you can give us any insights into how you are thinking about that potential change? Brian Moynihan : Okay well that looked like obviously a technical question and it\u2019s not that we haven\u2019t thought about it, but to be frank, its\u2019 just a speech at this point and he didn\u2019t really address that in his speech. So we don\u2019t really know the answer. That\u2019s one of the questions we have. I think once we get the best proposal we\u2019ll have a better idea, but all I can tell you is based upon our current reading of the speech, and particularly some of the changes you mentioned in CCAR around asset growth, we think that the substitution of the capital conservation buffer would be with the stress capital buffer would not be a material change for Bank of America given our risk profile and given how we run the company. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Brian Foran with Autonomous Research. Brian Foran : I guess we've had a couple of good quarters in FICC both for you and the industry, and I know volatile business not really looking for quarterly expectations. But just more broadly there is an investor debate, is it just a couple of good quarters or has the business absorbed all the changes in regulation, absorbed low rates, absorbed all the restructuring required and the cycles inflecting FICCs at the bottom and has upward pressure from here? So where do you come in on the debate, is it a couple of good quarters at this point or has FICC bottomed? Brian Moynihan : Well I think the way I come out of that debate is to go back many years ago and sort of think through the repositioning was done in our company and so the key was to make fixed work. You\u2019re talking about revenue, but we look at profit and so to get the profit we needed to have a fixed income and equities business. We had to take the cost structure down which we did in \u201910 or \u201911. Tom Montage and the team worked very hard at that and got the breakeven down over a $1 billion a quarter. And then we range along those a number of years and they\u2019ve actually taken out year-over-year. You can see the cost continue to be managed well despite higher revenue.  So I would say taking discussion I would say that the way our fixed income business generates revenue, a lot of it is around our capabilities and underwriting, our competitive capabilities and all the different from high grade leverage to everything that goes on and that\u2019s a relatively stable pool of revenue that you see repeated. And what goes up or down is really the activity around that based on the market ceasing in certain quarters in terms of the issuance and things like that.  When you think about the other thing that Tom and the team had to really go after which is to broaden our capabilities in the macro segment a little because that was something that traditionally the Bank of America/ Merrill Lynch came together and so that\u2019s added some more volume to it. So we think we\u2019ve been gaining share as Paul said earlier.  When you look at revenue comparison with one of the top 10 without all the [lead] charge or just revenue, but we think its driven by our fixed income capability and its driven by our connectivity from the issuer of the bonds and debt to the investor, and we\u2019ll continue to drive that. So the teams\u2019 done a good job and I\u2019d say we\u2019re at a fundamental level. Well this quarter feels better than last year\u2019s quarter. It\u2019s not a quarter that when you look across four or five years that we haven\u2019t come close to on many cases and have done better than a few times. Brian Foran : I guess a similar question on commercial lending. You referenced some of the strategies you have in place driving responsible growth, and how you felt good about the business going forward. But we saw this pause across the industry in the third quarter in commercial growth, the Fed numbers, your numbers, other banks reporting so far. Have you seen signs of customer demands coming back late in 3Q and early in 4Q, do you have visibility and confidence that the commercial loan growth cycle more broadly is still in gear? Paul Donofrio : What we noticed in commercial in the quarter was lower industry growth this quarter, and I think that really reflected a slow-down in closed, actually books closed acquisition financing for us which probably may be different for peers depending on the timing of transactions. And then uncertainty around the election and then I think some lingering concerns around certain countries or regions. That\u2019s what I think impacted the third quarter. When you look at the US, when you look around the globe, when you look at GDP growth, we\u2019re optimistic. We think the economy feels good, so in a good economy, we should be able to grow commercial loans. We\u2019ll have to stay focused on some sectors and some regions, but we think we can grow commercial loans.  There\u2019s enough utilization rates and revolvers, they came off their highs, but they\u2019re at the higher end of the range which also suggest or reflects good commercial activity. We\u2019re adding bankers in the US and commercial banking in small business. We\u2019re adding them to regions where we know we have some synergies or some capabilities and big MSAs. So there\u2019s no reason why we can\u2019t grow within our responsible growth framework, assuming the economy continues to trough along here. Brian Moynihan : Also if you think about by sub-asset class in real estate we modulate our growth based on our view of wanting a diverse portfolio and then how we lend in the business. And if you see that number it was growing on and it flattened out a little bit, and that relative to others that was a difference.  But Paul\u2019s last point is a key point. They are a credit worthy customers that we can do more with and the only way to do that is because we have a talented world class commercial banking team, is to add more capacity. And that capacity is starting to build and it takes a while, because we hire commercial banker and we sometimes give them some of the under-covered in our portfolio and then they go after the prospects that we have and it takes a while to build those up. People don\u2019t change commercial banking relationships in an afternoon. So in our business banking and our middle market especially across America, we have been adding commercial bankers and we expect that to be down to our benefit. Given an environment which maybe solid but okay, we\u2019d expect to gain in those markets as those bankers come on stream and become more productive and Alistair Borthwick and Katy Gnapp and their team is driving that.  It has proven that those bankers do get share and you\u2019ll see that come through. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Nancy Bush with NAB Research. Please go ahead. Nancy Bush : We are all of course very attuned to the issue of fraud after the recent news at Wells Fargo, both on the customer side and on the employee side. I guess my question to you would be, as you move more to digital methods of attracting customers and keeping customers, etcetera. Is fraud on either side becoming a bigger issue, or if you could just speak to the whole issue of how you prevent fraud as you become a more electronic bank. Brian Moynihan : I think when you think about fraud most people think about in terms of the electronic side, most people think about credit card, (inaudible) fraud been tried as a broad word. Arguments about whether the charge was valid, whether a [merchant] and things like that. And so there\u2019s long history of adjudicating that.  So as more and more sales online by the consumer, the techniques for online continue to develop. At phase to phase or point-of-sale the chip card win were largely through all our customer having chip cards, merchant what we call chip-on-chip i.e. used with a merchant chip machine is rising sort of 1% or so a quarter and is now as best we judge it in the high 20s or something like that Nancy. So all that being said, we expect to get leverage in our fraud losses in the consumer business, year-over-year we expect that to continue to come down, and so yes, that is a major initiative for us to continue to drive that down, part of its education to consumers, part of it getting the chip cards in the hand getting machine merchant using the chip machines. Part of it is the tokenization and wallets and things that go on in Visa check out and all the variations in Master Card and getting, because that\u2019s tokenized better execution and is more secure.  And so our view as a provider has been to adapt all these wallets and technologies that have this tokenization capabilities and that then drives down the cost of losses due to merchant complains and other types of things. So you\u2019re absolutely right, cyber security, theft of cards from other people and sold on the internet, all of that stuff is important for us and so we spend as we said $0.5 billion a year protecting ourselves, but also part of it is making sure we understand where our consumers are in terms of lost cards and things like that. Nancy Bush : Well how about on the other side there, the employee side, opening false accounts. If you could just speak to how you think your methodology is different from what produced the problems at Wells Fargo. Paul Donofrio : May be I\u2019ll take that one. Look I want to take just one step back, because to really answer that question you just have to have a better appreciation for how we run Bank of America, and it truly really does start with our purpose which is to help customers better live their financial lives and from there you have to understand what we mean responsible growth.  If you ask anyone in the company, responsible growth, it\u2019s about developing relationships so that we can grow with our customer\u2019s overtime, based upon their needs and goals. It\u2019s not about the number of products that would be open, its whether customers want to meet the products and services we\u2019re offering them and use them. That\u2019s how we measure ourselves.  We spent years building controls and governance and escalation around us. We\u2019re always monitoring them. It\u2019s just how we run the company. So that\u2019s probably the best answer in can give you in terms of how we think about this issue. Nancy Bush : And Brian, I have what is going to be a difficult question for you. But in response to the problems at Wells Fargo, we have seen them separate the Chairman and the CEO roles. And while that may have been due to exigent circumstances, do you foresee another push now either by regulators or by shareholders to separate those roles? Brian Moynihan : Nancy, I\u2019d say this, if we have dialog with all our shareholders off and Jack Bovender, Lead Independent Director, obviously we went through his, your so-goal, and we (inaudible) they voted on it, but the key is how we run the company, how we govern ourselves. So again Paul\u2019s view of what we talked about responsible growth, one of the tents is to be sustainable and sustainable and although it has to be sustainable and it involves things like you got to invest in the future, but also involves how we govern company and our Board, independence of our Board, the experience on our Board, how they approach their responsibilities I think is very strong and our shareholders have understood that agree with that.  So I think we govern ourselves in a very touch fashion i.e. the Board demanding on us and understand the strategy and has helped support through some times when people would challenge it. And I think it\u2019s proven to be the right strategy at this point. And so if we to technicalities, our leader and director duty are strong as anybody in the industry. If you look at all the new government surveys have come out all the words about proper governance and all the difference things you\u2019ve been seeing recently, we made or exceed everything. Anybody says to go to (inaudible) comfortable there. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Brenna Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead. Brennan Hawken : Just wanted to follow-up on the fiduciary rule questions before. So I appreciate retirement assets are less than 10% of your balances as you've highlighted before. But I think what a lot of folks are thinking about here is that SEC has been pretty clear that they are working on their own version of this applying to taxable. And so when people watch what you are doing here on the fiduciary rule for retirement people, it's sort logic to assume you would apply the same policy in the event we see a similar rule come out more broadly. So isn't that the message that you are basically sending to Fas, and aren't you concerned that FAs might look at your platform versus some of your competitors that will offer the (inaudible) and think that they might have greater amount of flexibility as some of those other platforms? Paul Donofrio : When you look at the advisor attrition today, its\u2019 at an all-time and we don\u2019t expect significant attrition for the same reason that attrition is low today. Merrill Lynch is a great place to work and serve your clients. So if you are FA, you\u2019re looking at a platform. We have market leading capabilities, we have breadth of products across banking and wealth management. We have lots of options in terms of servicing clients. We got great technology that we are investing in, tremendous transparency that provider tool, Merrill Lynch One, award winning research and an incredible global execution to global markets. So there\u2019s a lot of reasons to be here. This is a great place to serve your clients. We are implementing a strategy that creates significant flexibility for our advisors and we\u2019re delivering fiduciary, best interest advice to the clients. I said before we\u2019ll be king to this decision not to use the best interest exemption after a lot of months of thinking and research and this is better for our advisors and its better for our clients. The best interest exemption is going to create confusion, it\u2019s got operational pay-in for clients, it\u2019s going to be inefficient and cumbersome for advisors. This is the best solution we believe for our clients and advisors. Brian Moynihan : And if you look at the BRASS tax financials in to the third quarter of \u201916 we had $4.4 billion of revenue in our wealth management business. Of the 4.4 billion, 500 in total was brokerage and so this part of the business has been declining in favor of financial advice to the clients and to manage portfolios that meet the needs of the clients and have investment framers and decisions based on the client\u2019s goals. So the goals based method is the dominant method in our business and so you\u2019ve seen a constant growth in asset management fees, net interest income and other sources of revenue and frankly a cost decline in the brokerage business across many years. So the SEC has an obligation to rule on this at some point and they will and we\u2019ll adjust to that there, but its consistent, we have been taking the business five or seven years. Brennan Hawken : Sure, I get it and there's no question that commissions have been declining. It\u2019s just that when you look at some of the asset classes like alternatives and such it's hard to get everything to fit into a fee-based approach. So that was the gist of my question. But maybe going a different direction -- Paul Donofrio : Careful not to speak, just be clear we\u2019re not doing away with brokerage. Unless something changes in the industry and that\u2019s going to affect everybody, we\u2019re not doing away with brokerage. Brokerage is a very important part of our advisory relationship, and FA\u2019s will work that out with their clients what\u2019s best for them. Brennan Hawken : Right. But if we take the logical conclusion that your approach here with retirement would be similar to taxable under the assumption and, I am making assumptions with all of this, but we all have to that the SEC comes out with a similar rule, then your option within to maintain brokerage is self-direct. And I could see how FAs might dislike the idea of having a component of their relationship move effectively away from them. So what has been the response from FAs of this idea that if we want to maintain brokerage it has to go the self-directed route, and has that tapped in on any of the worries that some of these brokers have seen much of their book shift over to discount brokers that would fit in that type of an approach? Brian Moynihan : I thinking you\u2019ve stated yourself that you\u2019re making a lot of assumption. I think let\u2019s let it play out. We have the biggest and most capable business in the world, making more money and having better margins than anybody else and I think we\u2019ll figure it out. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Matthew Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Matthew Burnell : Perhaps a bigger picture question, on your media call you were asked a question on Brexit, and it sounds like you do have plans in place for that which certainly makes sense. I guess given relative to your $53 billion cost target for 2018 and the fact that the negotiations seem to be starting to gear up early next year, how you\u2019re thinking about the costs in the global markets and global banking businesses from Brexit if it ends up being a harder Brexit than a softer Brexit? Paul Donofrio : I think it\u2019s just too early to tell at this point. We don\u2019t know how it\u2019s all going to unfold in the UK and in Europe. We don\u2019t know what the effect is going to be on our clients on the new rules. So as I said on the press call, we\u2019ve developed plans based upon various scenarios and we\u2019re just going to have to wait and see how everything unfolds to know what we\u2019re going to do. But as I emphasized on that call, today we are focused on our clients and as I alluded to, this impacts them too. So for now we\u2019re just working with them, providing them loans, helping them raise capital to remove their money, manage risk and that\u2019s what we are focused on. Brian Moynihan : Just remember (inaudible) out of there, the markets business is about 20% of our expense base today. If that\u2019s the entire business, so I don\u2019t think the impact of Brexit in the overall company we would manage it without having any impact of any great magnitude. As it relates to the European business itself, we\u2019ll have an impact if it costs us more but not to the whole company. Matthew Burnell : And then just a quick administrative question, you mentioned on slide 9 that the non-performing loans in the commercial portfolio were increased by $340 million quarter-over-quarter. It seems like it's mostly in the energy and related space. Is that a US or are those US credits and what's your outlook for those balances going forward? Paul Donofrio : Yeah with two credits, one in metals and mining, one in the US and if you look at the ratio it\u2019s at a very comfortable level. So that doesn\u2019t concern us. If you note criticized assets were down in the quarter that\u2019s because these two credits that went NPL were already in reserved for criticized. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Vivek Juneja with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Vivek Juneja : Couple of questions, Paul, your deposits at the Fed declined pretty sharply almost 20% linked quarter, even though you had deposit growth and given that long-term rates are still very low. Can you talk a little bit about what drove that thinking? Paul Donofrio : Yeah, we moved some cash in to securities. We\u2019re always the managing the trade-off between sort of liquidity, capital in terms of interest rate movements and returns and we just deployed some of that as I said in US treasuries because you can think about it going from one part of the government to the other. We just moved them to get a little bit more yield. We feel good about that move and we\u2019ll continue to optimize our cash on investment securities. Vivek Juneja : Is that saying that you don't expect rates to go up that much, given that you move credit chunk at a time when long-term rates are pretty low? Paul Donofrio : I\u2019m not sure we\u2019re making any - we\u2019re not projecting any view of rates when we make that move, we\u2019re just balancing liquidity, capital and earnings. It\u2019s a big portfolio, we are always looking at to make sure that we feel good about where we are at any point in time. Vivek Juneja : One more question, earlier you mentioned in response to a question that global markets was doing a better job managing the balance sheet. Could you give us some more color about what specifically they are doing? Paul Donofrio : I\u2019m not sure I really want to give much color out there. They\u2019re doing the standard things you might do to optimize RWA, trade compression, looking at returns on various assets, and just optimizing. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead. Marty Mosby : Wanted to ask you about two strategic balance sheet decisions; one is that there seems to be a lot more retention mortgages. So when we have these surges, we are not picking up as much mortgage fees but growing mortgage loans maybe a little bit faster. That is a shift, and do you think that will hold mortgage fees down and trade-off for further net interest income down the road? Brian Moynihan : Yes you\u2019ve got the dynamic but the route is as Paul was just answering last question here we continue to build cash that we need to put to work. These are our core customers, very high credit quality mortgages and pipeline is grown quarter-over-quarter and continues to grow on production passing capabilities. So you\u2019ve got it right, the technical differences that are recognizing the upfront gain on sales of the mortgage and capitalizing the servicing, you see that come through NII over time. And the other dynamic remember is the MSR asset will continue to drift down because we have less and less third party servicing. Paul Donofrio : And again I want to point out, we\u2019ve done a lot of thinking about that, and we think maybe there is a near term impact on earnings but long term we think that\u2019s a better strategy for our shareholders given the risk profile of the mortgages that were originating putting on the balance sheet. Marty Mosby : And kind of in connection with that you talked about the big question on asset sensitivity, which is duration, expectation on your deposits. As you've gone through this cycle, and initially we all assumed that there was going to be a lot more volume run-off than the volumes just keep going higher. Have you adjusted that duration and is that part of why you are also comfortable putting on more mortgages that have that longer duration feel to it? Brian Moynihan : In terms of the technical modeling NII we still use the same assumptions we\u2019ve used. You could have great debate in our company whether we think those assumptions are conservative or not, but in terms of the NII modeling we\u2019ve been very consistent in terms of what they got Marty the deposit data and what would change and how it would work. I think the pragmatic answer is that we are - 90% of our consumer checking accounts are core transaction accounts, the primary checking account. Those balances are touching $250 billion plus. They\u2019ve been doubled over the last seven or eight years. Those balances are the data cash flow of household and I don\u2019t think they are going to change much, but until you\u2019ve got experience the model has to sort of look backwards as we say and so we\u2019ll see what happens. But so far those of us that take the side, this will be less sensitive if [won] let\u2019s just say that. Marty Mosby : And then lastly, just a strategic utilization of capital, if you look at your allocation of capital and returns by business segment, you kind of do a weighted average, you come up with close to an 18% return. As profitability is getting higher that\u2019s getting further away from the overall return which is still around 10%. How do you envision trying to clean up either the capital positions or the overhang from overhead expenses that brings those two numbers maybe a little bit closer together? Brian Moynihan : Marty, moving expenses down we talked about that earlier, that helps the returns. But we always have to remember that there is basically leave aside how the allocation works for the business, it works differently. But when you think about the 10% capital requirements for us 300 basis points or 3 percentage points of that cannot be put to use, it cannot take risk. And so we\u2019re earning all our money on the 7% and so when you think about the weighted average of that, it comes out over 10 and that means that you\u2019re in a lot more on the seven even across the whole company, and so that\u2019s one of the difficulties. So how do we optimize that, we make that 10% less dollar volume if we can keep dollar volume down and keep increasing earnings you get. That\u2019s by all the discussion Paul had in response to the questions about optimizing the balance sheet.  Will we get expenses down, will we grow less risky earnings that generate an income, but it\u2019s a constant optimization, but the basic principal of people that we sometimes forget is that when you think about 10% only 30% of capital can take no risk and so basically you\u2019re in to cost of debt. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead. Gerard Cassidy : A question on your digital sales, obviously you\u2019ve had 18% of total sales coming through digital channels and 25% through the mobile. Can you share with us what products you are having the most success with selling through these channels and which products proved to be more challenging? Brian Moynihan : Well generally you should think that the products which are more straight forward like a card application, we build a nice auto loan execution that\u2019s kind of unique and because those things are fairly straight forward applications. Mortgage and things like that it really takes a lot more process around them. So, I\u2019d say cards and autos are the [downward] part. Gerard Cassidy : Is there any target of where you can get these sales to as a percentage of total sales? Can eventually 50% of sales come through the digital channel? Brian Moynihan : I think it will continue to rise in terms of dollar amount, probably rise in terms of percentage. But remember as sales grow overall in the company, getting in to 50 means they have to win next race in the growth overall, but we are becoming more and more capable in delivering this and that\u2019s why you\u2019re seeing a nice growth and so we\u2019re applying deeply where it can really be the primary method and things like cards and auto are the easier place. Gerard Cassidy : And then, finally, sticking with digital; is there any application in the digital channel, where you can have success like you are having in the consumer bank in the Merrill Lynch brokerage channel? Brian Moynihan : Yeah, Merrill Edge is obviously across-the-board execution; their clients utilize that in Merrill and in US Trust and the broad consumer business. So, it\u2019s a broad execution and well recognized as being one of the leaders by the various authorities.  We believe and one of the things Jerry [Lockwood] and Keith Banks and Andy Sieg and John and other are working on is to increase our capabilities for both the advisor and the customer and the digital more or less stated in the (inaudible) business and so we think there is upside for us. Again less customers so the leverage is not quite the same and that\u2019s why we spend a lot of our time around the consumer, and there\u2019s just less leverage and the advisor you have to think about that business because the advisors are core strength that we have to the customer that we have to have an execution which is universal between the advisors and the customers, they can all see the same thing. So we\u2019ve got some great capabilities now My Merrill things like that. But we plan to continue and enhance them and continue to integrate them. So when they get to loans and deposits and things like that they are much more integrated over time. You can still see it all, but it\u2019s not where we want to be. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead.  Q - Brian Kleinhanzl I just had one quick question, and it\u2019s on the $52 billion expense target. If we got into an environment where you saw revenues come back more robustly near-term, could you still commit to that $53 billion target, meaning you have enough levers to pull or would you see yourself switching to maybe an efficiency ratio target if all of a sudden these revenues came back stronger? Thanks. Brian Moynihan : Yeah, if you remember when we made that target it was in the context of 1.5%, 2% GDP growth economy much like we have now in the rate environment, incremental from where we have now. So I think the shareholders and this management team would be happy if we are having a discussion about revenue related incentives going up faster than that that would be good news for the company. Operator : And it appears we have no further questions at this time. I\u2019ll return the floor to our presenters for closing remarks. Brian Moynihan : Thank you very much and we look forward to speaking to you next quarter. Operator : And this will conclude today\u2019s program. Thanks for your participation, you may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] Please note this call is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Mr. Lee McEntire. Please go ahead, sir. Lee McEntire : Good morning. Thanks everybody for joining us. I know it\u2019s a busy morning for all of you for the fourth quarter 2016 results. Hopefully, everybody has got a chance to review the earnings release documents that are available on our website. Before I turn the call over to Brian and Paul, let me remind you we may make some forward-looking statements. For further information on those, please refer to our earnings release documents, our website or SEC filings. With that, let me turn it over to Brian Moynihan, our Chairman and CEO for some opening comments before Paul Donofrio, our CFO goes through the details. Brian? Brian Moynihan : Good morning. Thank you, Lee and thank all of you for joining us to review our results today. Results this year in the fourth quarter complete a solid year of execution in driving our responsible growth strategy. We have produced earnings of $17.9 billion in 2016, that\u2019s a 13% growth over 2015. In a year in which we had a series of unexpected and sizable events around the world and a rough start in the capital markets, we are able to achieve 1% growth in revenue against the backdrop of a slow growth U.S. economy. Importantly focused on driving what we could control, cost, production and risk. So, how do we do on all that? We lowered our costs to improve productivity, with result in reduction expenses by almost 5% compared to 2015. That\u2019s nearly $3 billion in expense reductions continuing a long-term trend. From their peak in 2011 at $77 billion, expenses are now down $22 billion at 29%. And reductions coupled with the revenue growth drove 6% in operating leverage. In improving economy, a relentless focus on client selection and growth through responsible lending combined to result in a historical low charge-off rate of 39 basis points for our company this quarter. We also returned more capital to shareholders through higher dividends and more share repurchases during 2016. As you may have seen in the news release this morning, we announced an additional $1.8 billion expansion to our share buyback program. So adding the $1.8 billion to the $2.5 billion left, that brings us to $4.3 billion for the first 6 months of 2017. Our approach has resulted in a 2% reduction in share count at the end of 2016, which adds to the earnings growth to produce a 15% growth in earnings per share. For the year, our return on tangible common equity was 9.5%, while return on assets was 82 basis points. And the efficiency ratio improved from 70% to 66%. From a balance sheet perspective, let me mention a few things that are noteworthy as items continued to grow with the business, while optimizing the balance sheet at the same time. Our average deposits grew $64 billion or 5% compared to fourth quarter of \u201815. Our average loans grew $22 billion or 3%, as the lending segments outgrew the legacy runoff and Paul will show you that later on. On regulatory capital, we ended the year at 10.8% on a fully phased-in CET 1 advanced basis. Importantly, after reviewing our year end calculation and through the hard work of our teams, we are pleased to report that our method 2 G-SIB capital ratio requirement has dropped 50 basis points. So, our total 2019 CET 1 requirement is now 9.5%, instead of 10%. Turning to Slide 3, on these charts, you can see that each business segment played a role in driving our earnings growth in 2016. The businesses are producing good efficiency ratios and returns above the firm\u2019s cost of capital. And on this page, you can see that each business is driving hard to create operating leverage in the upper right hand corner. Consumer banking, our biggest earning business, continued its strong performance through its transformation, produced more than $7 billion in after-tax earnings, growing 8%. Our global wealth and investment management business improved its earnings 8% as well, earning $2.8 billion. Our global banking business serving our commercial customers continued to produce strong revenue and generated $5.7 billion of earnings. And lastly, but not leastly, our global markets business earned $3.8 billion, the most it\u2019s earned in the past 5 years, with a rebound in sales and trading revenue and strong expense discipline on the part of the team. As you know and you can see from the slides Paul walked through later, our business has important leadership positions across the board in their industry and we believe that they have room to grow their market shares by focus on deepening relationships with their existing customers as well as winning customers from the competition. Turning to Slide 4, let me cover a few highlights in the fourth quarter before I turn it over to Paul, reported earnings of $4.7 billion after-tax at $0.40 per diluted share and EPS improvement of 48% from the year ago quarter on a reported basis. We had a couple of pennies and net benefit this quarter from resolutions and tax matters that were partially offset by the combination of smaller charges for revenue, for debt hedge ineffectiveness, additions to our UK card ppi reserves we prepared for sale and DVA. This improvement in the year-over-year results was driven by expense reductions as we lowered costs by 6% from fourth quarter \u201815 to fourth quarter \u201816. Revenue from the fourth quarter \u201815 to fourth quarter \u201816 was up 2% on a reported basis. Note that this quarter had lower levels of non-core gains from equity, debt and asset sales than in past years. So, there is effectively more core earnings. Provision expense was modestly lower in the aggregate from fourth quarter \u201815 as our responsible growth strategy resulted in a 23% improvement in net charge-offs and we also had a lower amount of net reserves release from last year\u2019s fourth quarter. So overall, I am pleased with the results. The company has produced another quarter of solid results, with strong operating leverage. We reported year-over-year earnings growth in every quarter of 2016, with expenses declining in every quarter and revenue growing in 3 out of 4. Our focus on operating leverage, expense management and operating excellence continues. The fourth quarter \u201816 represents the 20th successive quarter of year-over-year non-litigation expenses going down. The expense reduction has been an important ability to grow our earnings without the benefit of significant rate increases. But now we see rate increases in the fourth quarter of \u201816 in the latter part of the quarter on both the long end and the short end. As these rate increases were late in the quarter, they didn\u2019t benefit the fourth quarter NII number that\u2019s significant, but we look forward to first quarter \u201817 when we expect NII to all things remaining equal by approximately $600 million per quarter despite having 2 less days in that first quarter. And with loan and deposit growth, we would expect NII to continue to improve from there throughout 2017 and beyond and Paul will take you through these numbers in a minute. This dynamic bodes well as we expect growth and earnings from productivity improvements will now get the added benefits of rate increases. This quarter, investors have a lot \u2013 asked a lot of questions that they usually asked, but importantly, questions about the incoming new Presidential administration. Their questions have ranged from corporate tax reform and what do we think about that, regulatory changes, economic growth and the impacts of these things and interest rate changes. The optimism for positive change here at Bank of America and among our customers is palpable and has driven bank stock prices higher. We will have to see how these topics play out, but that we are optimistic and we will continue \u2013 but in the interim, we will continue to operate the company by controlling and driving what we can. We are going to drive responsible growth. In prior calls, I have sort of answered the questions you are asking about the fundamentals. First, can we continue to stay this discipline on risk? Yes, we are making progress, growing our loans, growing our deposits, growing our market business and keeping the risk in check in all areas. And our credit is among the best it\u2019s ever been in history. Can we get earnings growth in low rate environment? The answer is yes. We are seeing our earnings growth even without significant rise in rates and now we look forward to those rises in rates. And the question is can we keep driving expenses lower? Again, the 20th consecutive quarter of year-over-year lower operating expenses and we have room to move them lower even as we continue a healthy investment across all our businesses. And can we continue to drive our returns up above our cost of capital? And we are seeing that happen. So while we are very optimistic about the future, optimistic about new policies which could spur our growth, we at Bank of America will continue to drive what we can control and that\u2019s a call through what we have and we\u2019ll keep doing that. With what, I will turn it over to Paul for the fourth quarter results. Paul? Paul Donofrio : Thanks, Brian. Good morning, everybody. Since Brian covered the income statement highlights, I want to start with the balance sheet on Page 5. Overall, the end of period assets declined $8 billion from Q3 as solid loan growth across our business segments was more than offset by lower levels of trading assets in our global markets business. On an ending basis, loans grew $10.9 billion from Q3 \u201816. This includes adding back $9.2 billion in UK card balances that were moved from loans and leases to assets of businesses held for sale pursuant to the announcement of the sale of our UK card business. Loans on a reported basis showed growth of $1.7 billion as a result of that movement. We expect to close the sale around the middle of the year subject to regulatory approvals. On the funding side, deposits rose $28 billion from Q3 or 9% on an annualized basis. At the same time, long-term debt fell by $8.3 billion, driven by hedge and FX valuations. Global markets trading liabilities declined in tandem with global markets assets. Lastly, common equity declined $3.2 billion compared to Q3, as additions from earnings were offset by a decline in AOCI and capital return to shareholders. AOCI declined by $5.6 billion. Driving the decline was a $4.7 billion reduction in the value of AFA securities held in our investment portfolio, which reduced in value as long-term rates rose significantly during the quarter. Reflecting this, global liquidity sources declined a bit in the quarter and in the year just below $0.5 trillion. However, we remain well compliant with fully phased-in U.S. LCR requirements. We returned a total of $2.1 billion to common shareholders through a combination of dividends and repurchases in the quarter. Return of capital, plus the decline in AOCI, drove a 1% decline relative to Q3 \u201816 in tangible book value per share to $16.95. However, it\u2019s up $1.33 or 9% from Q4 \u201815. Turning to regulatory metrics and focusing on the advanced approach, our CET 1 transition ratio under Basel III ended the quarter at 11%. On a fully phased-in basis, compared to Q3 \u201816, the CET 1 ratio decreased 12 basis points to 10.8% and remains well above our new 2019 requirement of 9.5%. CET 1 capital declined $3 billion to $163 billion, driven by the negative OCI valuations. Benefiting ratio was a $12 billion decline in RWA driven by lower exposures in our global markets business, partially offset by loan growth. We also provided our capital metrics under the standardized approach, which remain relevant for CCAR comparison. Here, our CET 1 ratio is higher at 11.5%. Supplementary leverage ratios for both the parent and the bank continued to exceed U.S. regulatory minimums that take effect in 2018. Turning to Slide 6, on an average basis, total loans are up $22 billion or 3% in Q4 \u201815, versus Q3 \u201816 we saw pick up in growth driven by holiday spending on credit cards and some late quarter growth in commercial activity. Looking at loans by business segment and in all other, year-over-year, loans in all other were down $26 billion, driven by continued runoff of first lien and second lien mortgages, while loans in our business segments were up $48 billion or 6%. Consumer banking led with 8% growth. We continued to see growth in residential real estate, as the pipeline from Q3 \u201816 flow-through, vehicle lending was solid, home equity pay-downs and runoff continued to outpace originations. In wealth management, we saw year-over-year growth of 7%, driven by residential real estate. Global banking loans were up 6% year-over-year. And on the bottom right chart, note the $64 billion in year-over-year growth in average deposits that Brian mentioned. Turning to asset quality on Slide 7, one can see clear evidence of our responsible growth strategy. Credit quality metrics remained strong, perhaps best symbolized by our net charge-off ratio which hit a record low of 39 basis points this quarter. Our strong credit quality metrics are a manifestation of our overall risk management which has been transformed since 2008 and we expect our performance to bode well as we move through economic cycle. Total net charge-offs of $880 million improved slightly from Q3 and are down $264 million from Q4 \u201815. Provision expense of $774 million declined $76 million from Q3 and $36 million from Q4 \u201815. Our net reserve release in the quarter of $106 million was slightly higher than Q3 \u201816, as we released $75 million of energy reserves, given the improvement in asset quality and current stability in energy prices. The Q4 \u201816 total net reserve release was roughly a third the amount released in Q4 \u201815, as consumer real estate releases continue to moderate lower. Our allowance to loan ratio this quarter was 1.26%, with a current coverage level 3x our annual net charge-offs. On Slide 8, we break out credit quality metrics for both our consumer and commercial portfolios. As you can see charge-offs improved in both periods with consumer real estate driving consumer improvement and reduced energy losses driving commercial improvement. We saw improvement in most of our other credit metrics. Turning quickly to Slide 9, net interest income on a GAAP non-FTE basis was 10.3 \u2013 $10.5 billion on an FTE basis. Compared to Q4 \u201815, NII this quarter was relatively stable after adding back the $612 million charge we incurred last year when we called some troughs securities. Compared to Q3 \u201816, NII was up $91 million. NII benefited in the quarter from solid loan and deposit growth. We also saw some modest benefit in NII from higher interest rates. Partially offsetting these benefits was market based hedge and effectiveness totaling $169 million related to the accounting for our long-term debt and associated swaps where we have swapped interest payments from fix to floating. This ineffectiveness is recorded in NII and will revert to zero over the remaining life of the debt. It is just a timing issue caused by accounting rules. Although I am not likely to give specific NII guidance in most quarters, the moving Q1 \u201817 is expected to be significant. So we wanted to provide some near-term perspective. As you think about Q1 \u201817 versus Q4 \u201816, the benefit from the absence of negative market related ineffectiveness will be offset by two less days in the quarter, so you can effectively take this quarter\u2019s NII as a starting point. Now assuming interest rates remain at current levels and we see modest loan and deposit growth, we believe we will earn approximately $600 million in additional NII in Q1, primarily driven by the Q4 rate increases in both the long and short end. From there, we would expect continued growth in 2017, assuming modest loan and deposit growth and stable short-term and long-term interest rates. With respect to asset sensitivity as at 12/31 and instantaneous 100 basis point parallel increase in rates, it is estimated to increase NII by $3.4 billion over the subsequent 12 months. Turning to Slide 10, non-interest expense was $13.2 billion. That\u2019s an improvement of more than $800 million or 6% from Q4 \u201815 and as you can see, the reductions are across the company and in virtually all line items of expense. Our productivity projects and efforts to simplify how we get our work done and how we deliver for our clients are driving these reductions. Q4 litigation expense was $246 million, which is fairly consistent with Q3 \u201816, but lower than the $400 million recorded in Q4 \u201815. Our employee base declined 2% from Q4 \u201815. However, we continued to invest in growth by adding primary sales associates across consumer, across wealth management and across global banking. As a reminder in Q1, similar to past years, we expect to incur roughly $1.3 billion for retirement eligible incentives and seasonally elevated payroll tax expense. Additionally, if we were to see a normal seasonal rebound in capital markets based activity, we would most likely see an associated increase in expense. Turning to the business segments and starting with consumer banking on Slide 11. This business is generating above average deposit growth, solid loan growth, improving customer satisfaction and strong growth in earnings. Consumer banking earned $1.9 billion and produced a 22% return on allocated capital this quarter. I would note that pretax, pre-provision earnings rose more than $400 million or 12%. 7% expensed and 5% NII improvement were both notable and enough to more than offset higher provision expense and prior year divestiture gains. Revenue was up 1% compared to Q4 \u201815, as NII growth was partially offset by the absence of approximately $100 million of divestiture gains in Q4 \u201815 as we sold the last of our larger non-core affiliate portfolios in that quarter. Credit quality remains good and provision was higher primarily as a result of reserve releases in the year ago quarter. Consumer continued to lower expenses and the efficiency ratio dropped nearly 500 basis points to 53% from Q4 \u201815. With good pricing discipline, prepaid on deposits remained a steady 4 basis points and the operating cost of deposits was also steady at 160 basis points. Turning to Slide 12 and looking at key trends, first in the upper left, the stats are a reminder of our strong competitive position. Looking a little closer at revenue \u2013 excuse me, looking a little closer at the revenue drivers compared to Q4 \u201815, while we report NII and non-interest revenue separately, it is important to emphasize again that our strategy is to focus on relationship deepening and growing total revenue, while improving operating leverage through expense discipline. Our relationship deepening is improving NII and balanced growth, while holding the fee line flat as we reward customers for doing more business with us. We believe the overall result is the more satisfied customers whose balances are more sticky over time. We continue to see strong client enrollment in our preferred rewards programs. For the year, we enrolled 1.2 million clients in preferred rewards and that\u2019s up 42% from 2015. We are seeing a 99% retention rate for customers enrolled in preferred reward. Average deposits continued their strong growth, up $54 billion or 10% year-over-year outpacing the industry. With respect to card, spending levels and new issuances were strong. However, the industry trend of increasing reward costs continues to mitigate our overall card revenue growth. By the way, this makes it even more important to hold down acquisition costs through the use of our branch network to source and fulfill customer demand. I would also emphasize that our underwriting standards in card results in a relatively higher quality new card customers that on the one hand have higher spending habits, but on the other hand, receive more rewards. Turning to expenses in the upper right, they declined 7% in Q4 \u201815 despite higher FDIC assessment charges between the two periods. Digitalization and other productivity improvements continued to help us drive down costs in our delivery network. Focusing on client balances on the left, in addition to deposit growth, client brokerage assets at $145 billion are up 18% versus Q4 \u201815 on strong account flows and market valuations. We also increased the number of Merrill Edge accounts by 11% versus Q4 \u201815. We now have more than 1.7 million households that leverage our financial solution advisors and self-directed investing platforms. Moving across the bottom of the page, note that the average loans are up 8% from Q4 \u201815 on strong mortgage and vehicle lending growth. Loan growth reflected total consumer real estate production of $22 billion, up 29% from Q4 \u201815 and 7% higher than Q3 \u201816 as the prior quarter\u2019s pipeline came through. We retained about three-quarters of first mortgage production on the balance sheet this quarter. As you might imagine, the sudden rise in long-term rates caused a noticeable decline in applications to refinance, driving the overall mortgage pipeline down 43% from the end of Q3. Auto lending was up 15% from Q4 \u201815, with average booked FICO scores remaining well above 750 and net losses of 35 basis points. On U.S. consumer card, average balances grew from Q3 aided by seasonal holiday spending. And spending on our credit cards adjusted for divestitures was up 10% compared to Q4 \u201815. Okay. Turning to Slide 13, we remain an established leader in digital banking. With improvements like our Spanish app and contactless sign in, we continue to see momentum in digital banking adoption. Mobile banking continues to transform how our customers bank and we expect to introduce our artificial intelligence application, Erica, this year. She will add to both the functionality and excitement around digital banking. Importantly, as adoption rises, particularly around transaction processing and self-service, we expect to see efficiency and customer satisfaction improve. I won\u2019t go through all the details on this slide, but mobile devices now represent 19% of all deposit transactions and represent the volume of more than 880 financial centers. Sales on digital devices continued to grow and now represent 20% of total sales. While these trends were important and continued to transform how consumers interact with us, I would remind you that we still have nearly 1 million people a day walking into our financial centers across the U.S. Many of these customers still use our branches to transact, but many also use the branch as a financial destination where they can learn more about products and services, work face-to-face with a specialized professional and generally improve their financial lives. Turning to Slide 14, global wealth and investment management produced earnings of $634 million, which is up modestly from Q4 \u201815 on solid operating leverage. The business continues to undergo meaningful change as firms and clients adapt to the new fiduciary rules and other market dynamics. We remain well positioned with market-leading brands and a wide range of investment service options ranging from fully advised to self-directed, with Guided Investing for those who want something in between. We also have strong margins and returns as well as resources to help us manage through market dynamics and customer trends. Year-over-year, non-interest income declined $104 million as higher asset management fees were more than offset by lower transactional revenue. A 4% decline year-over-year on expenses drove 170 basis point improvement in operating leverage from Q4 \u201815. The decline was driven by the expiration of the amortization of advisor retention rewards that were put in place at the time of the Merrill Lynch merger. Other declines were the result of work across many categories of expense more than offsetting higher litigation and FDIC costs compared to last year. Moving to Slide 15, we continue to see overall solid client engagement. Client balances climbed over \u2013 they climbed to $2.5 trillion driven by market values, solid long-term AUM flows, and continued loan and deposit growth. $19 billion of long-term AUM flows include clients transferring assets from AUM, client transferring assets to AUM from ROA brokerage. Average deposits of $257 billion were up 2% from Q4 \u201815. Average loans of $146 billion were up 7% year-over-year. Growth remained concentrated in consumer real estate. Turning to Slide 16, global banking earned $1.6 billion, which was up 11% year-over-year. Global banking continues to drive loan growth within its risk and client frameworks, continued stabilization in oil prices and improvement in exposures drove provision expense lower in Q4 \u201816. Investment banking fees were down 4% from Q4 \u201815 as strong debt underwriting activity was more than offset by a lower advisory and equity issuance fees. Expenses decreased from Q4 \u201815 despite the addition of new commercial and business bankers and increased FDIC costs. The efficiency ratio improved to 45% in Q4. Return on allocated capital increased to 17%, despite adding a couple of billion dollars of allocated capital this year. Looking at trends on Slide 17 and comparing Q4 last year. Relative to Q3 \u201816, we saw a pickup in lending, with average loans on a year-over-year basis up $19 billion or 6%. Growth was broad-based across large corporates and middle-market borrowers and it was diversified across industries. Average deposits increased from Q4 \u201815, up $6 billion or 2% from both new and existing clients. Switching to global markets on Slide 18, the business had another solid quarter. Given our broad product and geographic footprint, we were well-positioned to help clients address volatility around the elections and central bank policy uncertainty, both in the U.S. and abroad. We continue to invest in and enjoy leadership positions across a broad range of products. This business is another great example of our focus on improving operating leverage. Revenue grew 8%, excluding net DVA, while expenses declined 10%. Global markets earned $658 million and returned 7% on allocated capital in what is typically the most seasonally challenged quarter of the year. For the year, the return on allocated capital was 10%, as sales and trading revenue ex-DVA grew 5%, while expense declined. It is worth noting that we achieved these results with a stable balance sheet, lower VAR and 7% fewer people. Continued expense discipline drove costs 10% lower year-over-year, led by reductions in operating and support costs. Moving to trends on Slide 19 and focusing on the components of our sales and trading performance. Sales and trading revenue of $2.9 billion, excluding DVA, was up 11% from Q4 \u201815, driven by FICC. In terms of revenue, while we experienced a normal seasonal decline versus Q3, this Q4 was our second best fourth quarter in 5 years. Excluding net DVA and versus Q4 \u201815, fix sales and trading of $2 billion increased 12%. Mortgages showed particular strength among the credit products as investors sought yield. It was a challenging market for municipals. With the exception of rates, we saw an improvement in trading of macro products. Equity sales and trading was solid at $948 million, up 7% versus Q4 \u201815. Flows were strong in the second half of the quarter, driven by a challenging \u2013 excuse me, driven by a changing investor sentiment after the U.S. elections, which drove a favorable environment for derivatives as clients repositioned across industries. We were able to help many clients who are underweight equities leading up to the election at exposure. On Slide 20 we show all other, which reported a net loss of $95 million. This quarter includes a $132 million charge to add to our PPI reserve. You will also note that this quarter includes no debt security gains. Equity investment income was only $56 million and there was little to no gains from asset sales. Given the increase in rates and our progress with respect to reducing non-core assets, this quarter\u2019s results are more reflective of future trends with respect to these two line items. All other\u2019s Q4 \u201816 loss includes a net benefit from some tax matters of roughly $500 million, which reduced our tax rate in the quarter to 22%. Excluding those matters, the effective tax rate would have been about 31%. I would expect a similar tax rate of 31% for the average for 2017, excluding unusual items. Okay. Let me editorialize a little bit as I finish here. We reported solid results this quarter that capped a year filled with improvement. These results show that our strategy of responsible growth is working. One can see responsible growth in our deposit growth, while maintaining good pricing discipline. You can see it in the reduction in our expenses, even as we continued to invest in the future of the franchise. And you can see it in the deepening of relationships with our customers and clients. Our focus on responsible growth is helping us return more capital to shareholders and today\u2019s announcement of an increase in our share repurchase authorization is another example of that. Responsible growth has also driven the transformation of our risk profile, which is evident in our credit risk metrics and something we believe will differentiate us through future economic cycles. And responsible growth is driving operating leverage, which is visible in each of our lines of businesses. Lastly, responsible growth has put us in a solid position to benefit in 2017 from higher interest rates. With that, I will it open up to Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from John McDonald with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Your line is open. John McDonald : Hi, good morning. Paul, I was wondering if you could give us a little more split, some of the drivers of the net interest income increase that you are expecting to recur between the fourth and first quarter, the $600 million, how much is that is driven by the Fed hike we saw on the short end and how much of it might be the long end in rates versus loan growth? Paul Donofrio : Sure. Let me \u2013 maybe the simplest way to sort of answer that question would be to take you back to 9/30, right, when the inter-sensitivity on the long end was $2.1 billion. We saw 75 basis point increase in long end rates since then, so 75 basis points times $2.1 billion is $1.6 billion. At that time, the short end sensitivity was $3.3 billion. We saw 25% of 1%, 25 basis points. So $3.3 billion times 25%, that\u2019s another $600 million. So together, that\u2019s $2.4 billion. As you can see, just in the changes in the interest sensitivity, you divided by 4, you get your $600 million. Again, I would emphasize that we see NII growing from there as we moved to \u201817 assuming again we have modest loan growth, modest deposit growth and a stable short-term and long-term interest rate environment. John McDonald : Okay. And then the reason the 5.3 future sensitivity has now moved to 3.4 as you have rolled $2 billion into your base case outlook? Paul Donofrio : Yes. Conceptually, we have captured the decline in sensitivity. We are going to capture the decline in sensitivity that you just experienced in our NII over the next 12 months and you can see that under the calculation I just did for you. John McDonald : Okay, got it, that\u2019s helpful. Then a question for Brian on capital return and CCAR, some of the other banks have used the de minimis exception that kind of top off their 2016 CCAR authorizations. That leaves Bank of America standing out quite a bit on the low end of payouts versus peers, so I am kind of wondering \u2013 two questions, one how do you guys think about that de minimis, you did well in 2016, any reason that Bank of America couldn\u2019t think about the de minimis top off or their restrictions on that or could you do that at some point this year on the de minimis. And then second, as you move into 2017, what are your goals to get your capital distributions closer to peer payouts and why wouldn\u2019t you be able to do that? Thanks. Brian Moynihan : Yes. John, so this morning and as part of our release, we announced that we got approval for de minimis of $1.8 billion, that\u2019s the $2.5 billion we have for the first half of this year to bring the repurchased volume for \u2013 to $4.3 billion for the first half year. So we applied to that obviously in December and got the approval and our Board has approved it. Now it went out with the release this morning. In terms of next year, we will see what the scenarios are, the dollar caveats, but you are seen us constantly move our numbers up and we will continue to do that in our \u2013 our cushions and stuff are strong on the earnings, but the most important thing for us was kind of getting to make sure the earnings power of the company kept coming back and now with $17 billion earnings, we feel confident we will be able to push forward. Paul Donofrio : And John, that $1.8 billion was the full 1%. John McDonald : Great. And that\u2019s that will take you through \u2013 just as a reminder Paul, that will take you through the end of the CCAR period, right? Paul Donofrio : Right. The first two quarters, all in the first half year. John McDonald : Great. Thank you. Brian Moynihan : Thanks. Operator : And our next question comes from Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead. Jim Mitchell : Yes. Hi, good morning. Maybe I will just follow-up on the NII question a little bit, does that guidance that you provided include the sale of the UK card business and what\u2019s sort of the impact from that? Paul Donofrio : Yes. The guidance includes the sale of the UK card business. But just to be clear, that\u2019s not going to close until probably mid this year. And so that NII will be with us until it does \u2013 until it closes. Jim Mitchell : Sure. So when we think about going forward, what kind of deposit betas you are assuming in that $600 million per quarter and how do we think about the next rate hike, say we get one in June, which seems to be consensus, do you still expect to have very low positive betas from there? Paul Donofrio : Yes. So if you \u2013 again, if you go back to 9/30, I think we told you we were using deposit betas in our modeling on interest bearing deposits in the high 40s. And we said, hey, the first few rate hikes is going to be less. And the later rate hikes, it\u2019s going to be more. And that\u2019s kind of what we are experiencing. So if you kind of look at our deposit betas right now, you probably see it kind of inching into the 50s. It\u2019s definitely moving up as we get more short-term rate hikes. Jim Mitchell : And do you think that continue into third \u2013 the next rate hike? Paul Donofrio : Well, again I think \u2013 well, we will see what happens here, right. I mean we had a rate hike a year ago. And I think a number of people would have said that we would had a pass around I think there was a significant pass-through in the industry. We just had a rate hike in December and we are going to see how much capacity we actually have. From a modeling perspective, in that guidance I gave you, from a modeling perspective, the pass-through rate on the next 100 basis points would be in the 50s. And again, it would be the same story, less in the beginning, more at the end. Jim Mitchell : Yes, understood. Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. Thanks. Operator : And our next question is from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Glenn Schorr : Hello, there. Brian Moynihan : Good morning, Glenn. Glenn Schorr : Good morning. Two quickies. One on card, one on mortgage. On cards, you had some pretty good growth and we are seeing really big growth at some of the other big banks and some of the economics of the business are being given way to support that growth. I am just curious on how you are balancing that of customer growth versus giving up some of the economics to capture that growth? Brian Moynihan : Well, I think the way to think about it, Glenn, overall, is that we are doing on a customer basis. So when we \u2013 Paul gave you the statistics earlier for the preferred rewards enrollments and things like that, we are driving \u2013 our priorities are to get our card used by our core customers and reward them for that, who have other deeper relationships with the company. And so in a broad sense, we are getting paid through the NII line as well as in the other relationships they had as well as the card income fee line that you see on deposit balances and other things plus obviously the card balances. We have been pleased that we now have gotten through all the sales when you think about this quarter versus last year. And so active accounts are moving up I think 2% or 3% or so year-over-year. The active accounts were up, which shows the strategy is working. So while we make that investment you are talking about and that is part of the competitive dynamics. We feel good about the balances growing. So, we are getting more NII from it. But importantly, with our customers, these are the best customers we have and so we are seeing their other aspects of relationship grow. Paul Donofrio : And again, look, strong risk adjusted margins in that business is stable for us, above 9%. Charge-offs look great. And as Brian said, we are staying at the higher end of the market. Glenn Schorr : Yes, it\u2019s super ROA and ROE support of anyway for the overall company. And then the question on mortgage was, the production was good, but the pipeline fell a lot, obviously, a function of what happened in rates, but can you help us to think about what to expect, say, next year if say rates go up along the forward yield curve? Like how do you model that? How you can manage the expense along the way? Brian Moynihan : I think if you look at the page, Glenn that showed the quarterly production in the consumer section there, you see that I think it was three quarters over the last three quarters all over $20 billion in home mortgage loans and home equity loans. Look, you wouldn\u2019t know from the outside is during the last year, we have made a series of major changes in that business. We have consolidated the internal platform, so we have one group, a fellow named Steve Boland who does good job for us delivering the product across all the businesses, whether it\u2019s U.S. Trust, Merrill Lynch or the consumer business. In addition, we have brought in the servicing from third-parties of our customers and we continue to do that. So even in the year, we have made tremendous transformations even saw $320 billion plus. And so our view \u2013 the team would tell me that the pipeline will be down, because refinances are down and therefore expect less, but I think my view is that they should be able to continue to grow market share frankly because of the capacity that they were able to develop this year given those changes and still produce well. That being said, it\u2019s a rate sensitive product. So, we have told you, think about the mortgage banking income line as $300 odd million is a little higher this quarter just because some of the dynamics. So, it\u2019s a relatively modest line, but the production will be strong. Glenn Schorr : Okay, thanks very much. Operator : The next question is from Steven Chubak with Instinet. Please go ahead. Steven Chubak : Hi, good morning. So Paul, I wanted to start off with a question on the FICC business. The revenues have been remarkably resilient over the last couple of years really helped by some of the factors that you cited whether it would be strong risk discipline, balance sheet management and the reduction in VAR. But as we look ahead, what we have been hearing from a lot of folks is growing optimism around the FICC business in the coming year. And what I am wondering is, whether your strong risk discipline actually precludes you from participating in a significant recovery if then materializes to the same extent that some of your peers? Paul Donofrio : Look, we feel \u2013 as you point out, look, we feel really great about that business. It is performing very well. We know \u2013 I would note the operating leverage we are getting, I would note our \u2013 as you said that our discipline on risk and the reduction of VAR. So we have no complaints. We have a diversified product set that has a global geographic footprint. We have scale in every major market around the world. And when you look at global banking and global markets together, I would argue that only three companies in the world can deliver what we can deliver for our clients and customers in every major market around the world. So, there is tremendous opportunity there. We are not going to look exactly like every competitor every quarter. We have often said that when things are great, we might not be as high, but when things aren\u2019t so good, we are not going to be as low. So, we are not \u2013 we feel great about it, but \u2013 and we think there is lots of opportunity and we would expect continued performance in that business. Steven Chubak : Got it. And switching over to just the capital side for a moment, I mean, you highlighted the progress you made in reducing the G-SIB surcharge 2.5. And I am wondering as you think about how you are going to allocate capital across the different businesses, whether that positions you to reduce your firm-wide targets or you \u2013 and maybe more specifically, how are you thinking about your spot capital requirement today for the firm overall? Paul Donofrio : Well, I am not sure I understand the question. In terms of \u2013 so, let\u2019s just talk about it a bit. In terms of the allocation of capital, that\u2019s a process we go through once a year. We look at a number of different metrics, return on \u2013 advanced approach, standardized approach, SLR. We look at internal models, economic capital and we arrive at we think is the right amount of capital to give to our businesses based upon their business operations and risk. Remember, we have got $500 billion of operational risk capital that was assigned to us by the regulators. From my perspective, personal perspective, most of that is for businesses that we are no longer in, products that we no longer sell, risk that we no longer take. So a big chunk of that sits in all other and it wouldn\u2019t really be appropriate to push it from a segment standpoint out to the businesses, because they are not really using that risk capital. So, is that what you are looking for or was there some other element of that question that I missed? Steven Chubak : Well, I think the tricky part there and admittedly, it\u2019s a complex topic is thinking about how much capital you need to get through the CCAR process unscathed or maybe under the new SEB framework, how \u2013 like what\u2019s the minimum capital requirement that you would need over which you can \u2013 the remainder is considered to be excess and can be returned to shareholders over time? Paul Donofrio : Yes. We feel \u2013 look, we have made a lot of progress in CCAR. We have made \u2013 the progress we have really seen in the company \u2013 there is lots of technical things we have done to be much better on CCAR in terms of improving how we do it, involving everybody in the company, the qualitative aspects of it. I think from a quantitative standpoint, we have always looked like we have had enough capital. I think if you look at our stress losses relative to competitors, you can see responsible growth in \u2013 coming out in the Fed\u2019s models, not our models. And so I think we feel really good quantitatively. I think we feel really good qualitatively. If you look at the stress capital buffer, that\u2019s not going to impact capital for us, where we are probably \u2013 we would have to see how all the rules \u2013 this was a speech, so we don\u2019t really know what all the rules are going to say. But my guess is we are \u2013 our stress capital buffer is below the minimum that would be required, so we feel like we are in a good position for CCAR \u201817. We don\u2019t know what the scenarios yet. We don\u2019t know what the rules are. So, there is a lot still changing, but we feel really good about the progress we have made, and certainly, our cushion from a quantitative standpoint. Steven Chubak : Alright. Thanks for taking my questions. Operator : Our next question is from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good morning. Hi, couple of questions. One is on just the balance sheet and as you think about your cash duration, just the profile that you have today in a rising rate environment over time, do you expect to stay more static where you are today or any changes that we should be anticipating? Paul Donofrio : I don\u2019t think you should anticipate any changes. We haven\u2019t changed since rates started rising. We feel good about the way we are. We are very focused on hitting on our balance sheet. Deposits come in, that\u2019s what really drives the size of the balance sheet, deposits come in, and the question is, within our risk framework, can we put those deposits to work with our customers and clients around the world? If we can, we put it to work within our risk framework. If we can\u2019t, it goes into some other place, either cash or the investment portfolio. We are not really thinking \u2013 and we are always balancing liquidity, earnings and capital, but we are not really sitting there every quarter talking \u2013 figuring out what the most optimum duration is for us. Betsy Graseck : And then just from the cash perspective, the LCR, could you just give us a little color as to where you stand there and\u2026? Paul Donofrio : We are in very good shape. Betsy Graseck : So I hear you on that and it sounds like, okay, we have some excess cash and I guess that\u2019s part of the reason I asked the question, is there any interest in moving some of that cash into? Paul Donofrio : Well, yes, but LCR isn\u2019t just cash. I mean LCR includes highly \u2013 lots of different securities go into the LCR calculation. Betsy, to make it simple, when the excess of cash coming in over loan growth goes sort of half into mortgage backed securities and half into treasuries at this point. And we \u2013 the duration of what we do on treasuries will be a little bit based on where we think rates are going and stuff like that, but it\u2019s driven \u2013 it just it goes in those two things because we have \u2013 once we fund the loan balance, that\u2019s where it goes. Brian Moynihan : We are not trying to hold, Betsy more cash than we need. Betsy Graseck : Yes, that\u2019s good to hear. Other question was just on the improvement in the minimum capital ratio and the RWA reduction that drove that, could you just give us a little more color on the drivers there and do you feel like you are optimized now for what you want to take in terms of risk relative to total size balance sheet? Paul Donofrio : Yes, sure. So as I think Brian mentioned, I mentioned, we took the G-SIB buffer down 50 basis points. It\u2019s at 9.5%, again compared to 10.8% on a fully phased-in basis, so that\u2019s 130 sort of basis points of sort of cushion at this point. We got there through things like reducing derivative notionals through risk less trade compressions. We got there by lowering Level 3 assets, as well as overall optimization as the rules became a little bit more clearer. So we have been working at this for some time. You have asked in other calls, I think other people will have asked, we haven\u2019t really wanted to declare where we were, but now we got to the end of the year, this is one of the calculation really matters, so we thought it was important just to disclose that progress. I would also say that global markets, it\u2019s going to be up and down in any given quarter. Ending balances in the third quarter were up. They were a little bit less in the end of the fourth quarter just on client activity. Betsy Graseck : Great, okay. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead. Marty Mosby : Thank you. When you think about rate sensitivity in deposit betas, you get back to really deposit flows, we continued to see increases in deposit balances and until we see any pressure of those balances being kind of deployed back into the economy, there really shouldn\u2019t be much impact on pricing, what is \u2013 you are looking at the core deposit balances and kind of what are the flows you are seeing and where is that growth coming from and are you seeing any pressure in a sense of thinking of those balances being deployed back into the economy? Brian Moynihan : Well, Marty, we \u2013 so let\u2019s start. We saw a $50-odd billion of deposit growth year-over-year. Consumer business was the lion\u2019s share of that. To give you a sense, fourth quarter \u201815 to fourth quarter \u201816, checking balance in the consumer business grew 12%, so the growth is strong. And as you said, we expect to maintain pricing discipline in the company, not \u2013 obviously, those are non-interest bearing, but on the interest bearing side. So \u2013 and you have seen that so far as the first couple of \u2013 the first rate happened last year. In terms of deployment economy, we made $20 billion more loans, And we will continue to drive the economy and we can will invest in mortgage backed securities and things like that, so we are able to fund easily all the loan demand that we think is responsible to take on. And in the fourth quarter, we saw loan growth in our commercial business kicked up draws on lines, stayed at a high level. And loan growth in the middle market business was strong in the fourth quarter and we are looking forward for more of that in our small business. So you are exactly right, we are deploying the economy. There is not a lot of \u2013 they are growing faster than loans and we believe that we can price with discipline. Marty Mosby : And then on just two kind of unusual things out there, the hedge ineffectiveness, can you give us the actual dollar amount, it looks like the day count will typically impact you about $150 million to $200 million. And then other fee income looks artificially low, if you could just give us some color on that line item as well? Paul Donofrio : Sure. So the hedging ineffectiveness was $168 million in the quarter and negative obviously. And in terms of the other \u2013 you termed the income line. Marty Mosby : Other fee income? Paul Donofrio : So that last quarter, let me give you the sense. Last quarter, we had I think some \u2013 that line is going to bounce around a little bit, let me start with that. But the last quarter, we had some positive impacts in that line from loans related to our FBO portfolio. This quarter, it was negatively impacted by the UK PPI provision. That was $132 million and that\u2019s non-tax deductible. So look, if you adjust for just two items, we would be around $300 million. And I would say that\u2019s probably a good base for you to think about if you are modeling. Marty Mosby : Perfect. That\u2019s \u2013 we were right in that range, so that got us right back to the normal level. Thank you. Operator : And we will go next to Mike Mayo with CLSA. Brian Moynihan : Good morning Mike. Mike Mayo : Hi. So there is certainly a lot of positives on this call, whether its deposits, loans, expenses, etcetera, but the end result, it\u2019s still a single digit return on equity, a return on tangible common equity and I know you wanted to be higher, I know it\u2019s improved, but it\u2019s still below your peers today at 13% and below your target of 10%, so can you give us a target metric for RoTCE for 2017 or when do you think you get to that double-digit range where some of your peers are? Paul Donofrio : So thank you, Mike for noticing the improvement because we feel really good about all the progress we have made. As you point out, earnings I mean are up year-over-year on a 15% and that\u2019s on the very significant earning base of $18 billion. We need to get our capital down. We are returning more capital to shareholders. That\u2019s going to help. We need to continue to grow. So we feel really good about the progress that we have made. Our return on assets metric is tracking in the right direction. Our return on tangible common equity metrics is tracking in the right direction. So we will just have to wait and see. I think we would get there even without a rate rise eventually, but certainly rate rise is going to help. Mike Mayo : Well, as a follow-up, I know I ask this each year, but I mean you just said wait and see and that\u2019s kind of been the answer. Is it just seems like from an investor standpoint, you get a free pass, like you will get to the double-digit RoTCE when you get there and as investors were just going to have to wait and see, I just \u2013 it would be nice to have that metric or more color or just anything else you can give along these lines. And maybe just more of that color, the efficiency ratio, I got it, you have gotten better, but still not where I think you want to be at 66% and your peers today, they have reported 60% for last year, what else can you do with the efficiency which might help improve that RoTCE to a double-digit range? Paul Donofrio : Mike, a couple of things, one is, if you look across the last three quarters, the return on tangible common equity was 10.5%, 10.28%, 9.92%, so you have a fourth quarter seasonal decline in trading, so it\u2019ll pick back up in the first quarter and we look forward to that going back up. And on the efficiency, we have told that \u2013 set the goal of $53 billion in expenses. And whether the rate increases, we will continue to drive that down. And if you look through the year-over-year, it was down from 70 into 66. In the last couple of quarters, have grown to sub-65, around 65 and it will continue to move from there. Mike Mayo : Okay. Last follow-up, you have come a long way with branches from 6,000 down to 4,600, where do you think you ultimately could take that branch count and why all of a sudden are you reducing the level of ATMs? Brian Moynihan : Well, the ATMs are coming down, largely because as you reduce branches, there is one or two and then third-party ATMs in places that aren\u2019t very efficient. So they will continue to wind down, so I wouldn\u2019t necessarily focus on that as being a separate question and so we build them out. But if you think about the \u2013 on the branch, we are down. Through the year, we had 179 that closed, but we also renovated 205, put out 34 new ones. So we are continuing to invest, yet there is a steady downdraft in the total branch count. So I think we ended the year at 4,500, almost 4,579. So we will continue to work that count down. Again, based on how the customer flows go. These are critical to serve the customers and so we will end up as larger branches and smaller branches that are being folded in and we will continue to do that. Paul Donofrio : Yes. I think as you look at \u2013 think about that number, my focus on the active mobile users, because that\u2019s going to be the interplay here. We have got \u2013 active mobile users are up 16% year-over-year. On a big base, we grew active mobile users more than we grew in 2015. And deposit transactions are now 19 \u2013 mobile deposit transactions are now 19% of all deposit transactions, that\u2019s the equivalent of 880 financial centers, but \u2013 so that\u2019s \u2013 on the one hand, that says maybe you can optimize a little more, but on the other hand, as I said in the lead in, we still have 1 million people, almost 1 million people coming to the branch everyday and they need that channel. They need it to transact some of them. But a lot of them come in for advise and we want them to do that. So, we need a certain footprint of financial centers. I think Brian alluded to the fact that we are adding financial centers all around the country in certain markets around the country. So, it\u2019s going to ebb and flow. Mike Mayo : Alright. Thank you. Operator : And the next question is from Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Matt Burnell : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Brian, maybe a question for you, I noticed on Slide 19, the breakout of the global markets revenue mix, 40% of the revenue in the past year coming from outside the U.S. and Canada. As we look towards what appears to be a potentially more volatile market condition in Europe relative to the Brexit negotiations which are set to start early in 2017, how are you thinking about that and what the effect could be on your sales and trading revenue in 2017? Brian Moynihan : Alright. But I think there is already \u2013 there is volatility this year around it just on the announced vote and things like that. Earlier in the year, that was one of the events that I referenced. The nice thing of the balance in this business when you think about it, so it\u2019s balanced by product, it\u2019s balanced by geography. So when one thing goes, there is something else that\u2019s going well, we pick it up. So, I am not overly worried about \u2013 we have got to get Brexit right as our company and industry and everything and there is a lot of discussion about that. But in terms of the impact on the trading revenue on a given day, it will ebb and flow and we will get through it. But the good news is as the United States strengthens in the first part of the year, we have seen a good normal first quarter developing, and we have seen customer activity strong, all of which bodes well. So we will get through it. Matt Burnell : Okay. And then if I can just follow-up on your earlier comments about the post-election positive sentiment. Can you give a little more color as to what your borrowers and what your corporate clients are saying in terms of what their demand, the increase in their demand could be or are they holding back a little bit waiting to see what comes out of the Beltway over the next 6 to 9 months? Brian Moynihan : What I\u2019d reflect on is that as you came from \u2013 through the summer into the fall through the election, you saw both on the consumer side and commercial side, you saw increasing optimism. On the consumer side, you saw a bit of an acceleration in spending coming into the fall. And so just if you think about the middle-market business, as I said earlier, the revolver utilization is on the high end of where it\u2019s been the past several years at 40% plus in a \u2013 that group, which is our middle-market business, a commercial real estate business, etcetera, at about $4 billion with loans in quarter four, so all that really relates to greater business confidence. And so I think we feel very good where businesses stand and if you get the same reports in the small business side, so they are very \u2013 as I go out and visit these clients, they are very optimistic. They think policies will be supportive of growth in their businesses. And they are facing all the things that we face. Can they find the good employees? Can they find the final demand? But I think overall, the optimism is very strong. And we are seeing it translate into some loan balances. I think it\u2019s still \u2013 will play out into early next year. Matt Burnell : Okay, thank you. Operator : Next question is from Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim. Please go ahead. Eric Wasserstrom : Thanks. Two quick questions, please. One is on the \u2013 can you just perhaps update us on your outlook for auto credit? It\u2019s been an issue that\u2019s been a bit of a battleground, particularly on the mid and low FICO range? And I know that\u2019s not where you are concentrated, but I would love to get your perspective there? Paul Donofrio : So we have got market share around 3.5% and we are originating in prime and super-prime with average FICO scores at 7.71 and debt to income ratio was at sort of all-time lows. And if you \u2013 and I know this isn\u2019t necessarily completely responsive to your question, but credit statistics here are phenomenal. I think in the quarter, our net charge-off ratio was 19 basis points. So we are able to grow that and we did grow it in the quarter well and we are able to grow it within our risk tolerance. Now the fourth quarter was a great quarter or not, though I think we have all seen the numbers and we are expecting that growth to continue assuming a modestly improving economy, we are expecting that growth to continue in the first and second quarter I guess as guidance I would give you kind of auto growth in sort of mid to low single-digits. By the way, I have just been corrected here. Our net charge-off ratio in the fourth quarter was 35 basis points, not 19, but still well, well within our risk tolerance for that product. Eric Wasserstrom : And does the potential decline in collateral values present any particular concern to you, guys? Paul Donofrio : It presents a concern and you watch it carefully, but where we keep our business because how we view this business is it\u2019s a very high credit quality business. It hasn\u2019t affected us, as Paul just said, but we see it in the industry and it\u2019s obviously a concern, but there is always some seasonality to those recoveries and those statistics reported, but overall, with our high FICOs are 7.70ish range, so it\u2019s not really \u2013 it doesn\u2019t really affect us. Eric Wasserstrom : And just one quick follow-up on capital return, I just want to make sure I understand all the dynamics. It seems that there is two trends that are coinciding. One, of course, is the continued increase in targeted payout ratio as a percent of your earnings. And then, of course, there is the expansion in earning of themselves, is that the right way to think about it and is there ever any dynamic to consider? Paul Donofrio : You have it right. Well, actually, the only thing I would add is the process itself in terms of the scenarios and things like that, but we have had plenty of cushion, so unless they change dramatically, you\u2019ve got it right. Eric Wasserstrom : Thanks very much. Operator : Our next question is from Paul Miller with FBR Capital Markets. Paul Miller : Hey, thank you very much and good quarter guys. Talking about mortgage banking a little bit, you talked about that you did about $22 billion of originations in the quarter. And correct me if I am wrong, Brian, but did you mention that your portfolio three quarters of that on to the portfolio? And if you did, what was the breakout between jumbos, just a rough estimate between jumbos and regular conforming or were they all jumbos? Brian Moynihan : Yes. So, we balance sheet I think, to be precise, 78% this quarter. And we generally balance sheet all of the jumbos. So then the question is for conforming how much do we do, I don\u2019t really have that in front of me. We are starting to do more conforming, but we are certainly not doing all of it, maybe a good guess would be around half. Paul Donofrio : Okay. Paul, just to think about that a second, that credit quality mortgages is so strong that frankly it\u2019s not worth getting the guarantees and things like that, we have the liquidity to fund them and it\u2019s obviously jumbos, but even on conforming, the credit quality of ours is at the top end and I think the charge-off ratio was 3 basis points in the fourth quarter. So economic, it\u2019s better to keep them the pay for the guarantee. Paul Miller : Now we are seeing a lot more people portfolio before what you just said because the guarantees are so expensive, is the PHH, is that all now consolidated down into your operations, the PHH stuff from Merrill Lynch that you brought over? Paul Donofrio : Yes, we are getting \u2013 it\u2019s finished up and we are still working through the last part of the conversion, but it\u2019s basically in-house. Paul Miller : Okay. Hey, guys, thank you very much. Operator : Our next question is from Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Matt O\u2019Connor: Good morning. Brian Moynihan : Good morning, Matt. Matt O\u2019Connor: Sorry if I missed it, but did you guys comment on the $53 billion expense target that you put out there, I think it\u2019s exiting 2018 was what you said? Brian Moynihan : It\u2019s still good. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay. So even if revenue is better than expected, but it\u2019s rate-driven, that\u2019s not going to impact expenses materially? Brian Moynihan : Yes. It\u2019s still good and we still target that. And you are exactly right, rate increases will go to the bottom line. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay. And then separately, credit quality overall is very good, the charge-offs, the non-performers. You did flag the \u2013 I think the non-guaranteed consumer early delinquencies, I think it was about 15% 2Q and a little bit year-over-year, just anything to flag there, especially given how quality of the consumer book is? Paul Donofrio : Yes. That was the transfer of servicing that we just talked about on the previous question. Matt O\u2019Connor: Apologies about that. Okay. Paul Donofrio : No, that\u2019s good question, but it\u2019s \u2013 we transferred servicing at the end of the quarter. When you transfer servicing, you have got to redo all the bill pay. And there is \u2013 that\u2019s just the result of not getting all those bill pays done off the quarter. By now, we are probably 90% of the way through that problem. It\u2019s just the timing issue. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay. And then ex that impact, I assume the earlier stage delinquencies, what would the early stage delinquency look like? Paul Donofrio : I think 30-plus day in \u2013 mortgage was actually down $40 million, I think. Brian Moynihan : Absent that. Paul Donofrio : Absent that issue. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay, that makes sense. Thank you. Operator : We will go next to Nancy Bush with NAB Research. Brian Moynihan : Good morning Nancy. Nancy Bush : Good morning. Brian, could you just talk a little bit about your deposit market share, I mean you are sort of up the Street or around the corner from a company that showed us this morning that they are getting a lot of churn in their deposit base, so are you able to track whether you are benefiting from that? Brian Moynihan : I wouldn\u2019t. I don\u2019t think we have specific guidance on that. Our market share \u2013 we are growing our deposits faster than market, therefore your market share is growing, where it\u2019s coming from exactly. Nancy, just for a historical perspective, because you have been around this company as this industry for a long time, I had them check something, but from 2007 to today, effectively the deposit per branch have doubled. And the checking account numbers are basically flattish and up maybe 1% or something like that, so think about the dynamics in terms of profitability. So we feel very good about the growth in deposits year-over-year, 12% in checking and 10% overall, so it\u2019s coming from somewhere, I just don\u2019t know where exactly. Nancy Bush : Can you just give us an idea of where \u2013 are you gaining more market share through digital, mobile, are you gaining more through people still coming in the branch? Brian Moynihan : The answer would be yes because\u2026 Nancy Bush : All of the above? Brian Moynihan : Yes. Let\u2019s think about it. I think Paul said earlier that mobile sales are 20-odd \u2013 20-ish percent, but that means 80% are not mobile therefore they are coming through other \u2013 call centers and branches, so it\u2019s an integrated business system. And Thong and Dean and the team have done a great job of optimizing that. If you look at the chart and watch the cost per deposit, deposit continues to work its way down while there is growth and additional salespeople. So it\u2019s coming. The year-over-year rise in mobile sales is actually faster, obviously, but it\u2019s still only 20% of the contribution. Paul Donofrio : The other thing interesting, by the way, we are using a statistic I really like is we are using \u2013 we have digital appointments, so people come into the branch, but they don\u2019t just on walk in. Now, they are coming in for an appointment that they have made with over their smartphones. So that really helps us from an efficiency standpoint as well if we can get people to do that it\u2019s better for them, it\u2019s better for us. Nancy Bush : Okay, yes. My follow-up question is this, I mean we have experienced or we experienced on November 8 sort of a sea change in the thinking about bank regulation going forward and everybody that I have talked to seems to think even if there are not significant changes in what\u2019s on the books, that there will be a \u201clighter touch\u201d in regulation and I guess I would ask if you are thinking in those terms and if so, do you think that, that will have an impact on your expense figure, expense numbers, number of people you need to add and compliance, etcetera, etcetera, sort of ongoing? Brian Moynihan : I think Nancy, if you think about it, there are a couple of dimensions obviously. That dimension is well spoken about out there. You saw yesterday, I think the House passed a couple cost benefit analysis type requirements for the SEC and the commodity things, so I think there will be a body of work that will go on to sort of balance, let\u2019s make sure we understand the pluses and minuses a lot of stuff. But the reality, if you think about our company, we have maintained \u2013 we invest a lot of talent and capabilities in people, in compliance and risk in \u201810, \u201811, \u201812 and it\u2019s then relatively flat, but the company has shrunk around it, so it\u2019s become a higher percentage, but it\u2019s not \u2013 we are able to now start to optimize that, make it better. And so I think if we get that, that\u2019s terrific, that will help us even do more potentially. But even if we don\u2019t, there is optimization to come now. We kind of crested all the different things have gone on in the industry. So first, it was the work of just collecting the bad mortgage and stuff, but now you are optimizing more the way we manage risk in a systems environment and stuff like that, so I look forward \u2013 that\u2019s what helps us to get confidence of the future path on costs overall. Nancy Bush : Okay, alright. Thank you. Operator : And we will take our last question from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead. Brian Moynihan : Good morning Gerard. Gerard Cassidy : Hi Brian, how are you. I have got a question for Paul, you made a comment about that the end of the growth, end of the quarter, you saw some commercial activity, I know Brian referenced already some pickup in middle markets and commercial real estate, but can you give any further color of that commercial activity that you saw in the lending side at the end of the quarter? Paul Donofrio : Yes, sure. That\u2019s \u2013 well, the earnings prep talk into ahead of our middle markets business, our DCB business and our small business banking. They are telling me that they are definitely seeing more interest from CEOs to have meetings. A lot of engagement around \u201817 and what the environment might be, things are feeling a lot more optimistic to those bankers. And it\u2019s not just talk. Late in the quarter, we actually did see an increase in loan balances that was a little \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t call it a spike, but there was definitely an acceleration late in the quarter in \u2013 particularly in middle market and to a lesser extent us in business banking. Gerard Cassidy : Great. And another question actually Paul, obviously the banking industry has to live by a number of regulations that are dictated by the regulators on capital, liquidity, etcetera, coming back to that operational risk capital number you gave us for businesses that you have exited and no longer are operating in, is that an opinion that the Fed has just laid upon all the banks or is that actually in statutes where \u2013 to change it would require a lot of work versus if it\u2019s just the Fed wants to do that to make it extra conservative, maybe a new change in the Fed could maybe give you guys some relief there? Paul Donofrio : Yes. So we have $500 billion of operational is RWA. I think our closest competitor has $400 billion. And then I think Citi is probably at $300 billion something. So we were given more by the regulators based upon the history of the bank, the acquisitions we did, the losses that were historical. But as you know, we have exited a lot of those products. We \u2013 Bank of America never had a risk profile. It was more the companies that we acquired, so it\u2019s a little bit arbitrary. There are models out there for calculating operational risk capital. Those models, there is lot of debate if you follow the Basel Committee process. So we are focused on trying to get that number down. But it\u2019s going to take a little while and we are going to need more clarity from the regulators on how they want to calculate a company\u2019s operational risk capital. But that\u2019s something that would be very helpful to us if new models were approved that were a little bit more rational in terms of looking at historical losses versus the current operations of a company. Gerard Cassidy : And then just finally. I think in your K, you put your DTA from last year, it might have been around $25 billion for the deferred tax asset, do you have an estimate yet for where it will stand at the end of \u201816? Paul Donofrio : Yes, I do. The total DTA, guys keep me honest here, but I think it will be $19 billion. But let me give you the number that kind of matters probably is what you are \u2013 if you are thinking about the future. I mean we are not here sitting predicting any tax change, but what really matters if there is to U.S. tax change in the U.S. is, I will use 2015. In 2015, we had over $20 billion of U.S. profits, pretax profits, that\u2019s an important number. And then the other number that\u2019s important is, at year end, our DTAs that would be re-priced if the tax rate changed equaled approximately $7 billion. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you very much. Brian Moynihan : Thank you. Alright. So that was the last question. Let me close by closing up \u201816. We had 13% increase in net income for the year, 15% EPS. We had a good operating leverage, with 1% revenue growth and 5% expense growth. And we announced today that we increased our stock repurchase program another $1.8 billion. So that closes off a good year. As we look forward to 2017, we will just continue to do what we told you we are doing : focus responsible growth and we look forward to the benefits of a faster growing economy potentially and the increasing rates. So, thank you for your time and we forward to next time. Operator : This will conclude today\u2019s program. Thanks for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great weekend.",

[Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn today\u2019s program over to Mr. Lee McEntire. Please go ahead, sir. Lee McEntire : Thank you. Good morning. Thanks to everybody for joining us this morning for the first quarter 2017 results. Hopefully, everybody\u2019s had a chance to review the earnings release documents that were available on our website. Before I turn the call over to Brian and Paul, let me remind you, we may make some forward-looking statements. For further information on those, please refer to either our earnings release documents, our website or our SEC filings. With that, I\u2019m pleased to turn it over to Brian Moynihan, our Chairman and CEO for some opening comments before Paul Donofrio, our CFO, goes through the details. Take it away, Brian. Brian Moynihan : Thank you, Lee. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining our first quarter results. I\u2019m going to begin on slide two. And first, this quarter is another solid example of driving responsible growth at Bank of America. My teammates continue to deliver for customers around the world, and not many companies have the resources we have to help our clients drive the global economy. But with that, we understand responsibility comes with doing this, and we do it in a responsible way. Responsible growth is driving more sustainable returns for you as shareholders also. This quarter, we produced strong revenue growth; we drove cost savings that offset higher revenue related cost; and we managed risk well; and we returned more capital to you, our shareholders through dividends and increased repurchased shares than any period since the crisis. Turning to slide three. Our Company produced earnings of $4.9 billion after tax in the first quarter of 2017. Those earnings were up 40% compared to the first quarter of last year, driven by 700 basis points of operating leverage. Revenue rose 7% and we managed to keep overall expenses flat. Our earnings per share were $0.41 per share; on a diluted basis that was up 46%. This is the fourth quarter in a row we\u2019ve exceeded $0.40 of EPS per share. We did that in quarter one despite $1.4 billion of annual retirement-eligible incentives and seasonally elevated payroll tax costs. And importantly, we have done this in a responsible matter, not reaching for growth outside of our established risk and customer framework. And we achieved this in economy which continues to grow in the 1.5% to 2% range. On a year-over-year basis, our average deposits were up $58 billion, average loans were up $21 billion, and sales and trading revenues excluding DVA were up 23% with better client activity. We saw $29 billion in long-term asset under management flows this quarter within our wealth management business. Asset quality remains strong with provision expense of $835 million. Net charge-offs were down 13% from the first quarter of 2016 but were modestly up from the fourth quarter of 2016 as expected from the normal seasonality especially in consumer credit cards. Regarding progress against long-term metrics, the first task the Company had many years ago, was to become stabilized; then it was to reduce our legacy costs and simplify the place. And then we drove toward sustainability of results. Once results came more sustainable, we pushed towards generating return on tangible common equity above our cost of capital. We\u2019ve now shown that we have a return on tangible common equity in the double digits for last four quarters. And keep in mind we have been doing this where capital continues to build. The next step is to push that towards our 12% target. This quarter, our return on tangible common equity was 10% where return on assets was 88 basis points; these are reported numbers. The efficiency ratio was 67%. These figures reflect solid progress in this quarter against our long-term targets, but are even closer, if you were to allocate the seasonal aspects of the retirement-eligible compensation costs and elevated payroll tax expenses, across the years, just opposed to putting it all in the first quarter. Even though the quarter one is typically a good capital markets quarter for us, if you just spread those costs, you\u2019ll see that across all the quarters, the metrics this quarter would then reflect an efficiency ratio of near 62%, return on assets nearly 100 basis points and return on tangible common equity of 12%. So, simply put, we\u2019re getting there. On slide four, as I mentioned, the key to profitability in this environment is to drive good core customer growth and revenue while controlling our costs to drive operating leverage. We have a established record for the past several years producing quarterly operating leverage on a year-over-year basis. This quarter, you can see on the slide four better revenue growth on year-over-year base across each of our business segments. We were also able to hold expenses overall in the Company flat through the careful management of costs. As you can see on this slide, there\u2019s 700 basis points of operating leverage for the total Company. Some of our businesses like our consumer business have been driving operating leverage consistently for many years in a row now. So, unlike our global banking business, are using operating leverage to drive the Company to the best line of business efficiency ratio among our businesses. Other businesses continue to have leverage opportunities are becoming more clear, this is the case in our wealth management or global markets businesses. As you turn to slide five, you can see the line of business results. Each business improved their efficiency ratios, each line of business reported returns well above the firm\u2019s cost of capital. Consumer banking continues the strong performance and transformation. There is $1.9 billion in after-tax earnings this quarter, growing 7%. And on a pre-tax pre-provision basis, PPNR, which includes the prior year\u2019s sizeable reserve release, the PPNR was up 17% year-over-year. The efficiency ratio in this business was down 500 basis points to 53%. Global wealth and investment management improved the earnings 4%, earning $770 million after-tax improving its profit margin to 27%. This is a new record for the business. Our global banking business produced a record revenue quarter, led by a strong investment banking results and that generated $1.7 billion in after-tax earnings. It remains our most efficient operating business at 44%. Lastly, our global markets business earned $1.3 billion in after-tax earnings, generating a 15% return on its allocated capital. Improved performance in sales and trading revenue combined with strong expense discipline that drove those results. Our other category shows a loss, driven mostly by the $1 billion in first quarter of FAS 123 cost and related personnel taxes, which gets allocated across the business segments throughout the year. But the reduction in losses year-over-year was driven by improved operating costs in the Company and lower litigation expense. As you\u2019ll see from the slides Paul will walk you through later, our businesses have important leadership positions across the board. We believe they have room to grow both, market share by deepening relationships with existing customers and by winning customers from the competition. Overall, I\u2019m pleased with the results this quarter. We grew the topline; we grew the bottom-line and we did it the right way, all while making significant investments in people, technology and more capabilities for our customers, and all that will bode well for future growth. While many of you might focus on rates and our leverage to rising rates, note that the $1.5 billion in year-over-year revenue growth is split 40% for NII which is driven by rate and by also the growth in loan and deposit balances, and the other 60% was driven through non-interest revenue. As you know, we remain focused on things we know we can control and drive. We maintain our discipline on both expenses and pricing. Our rates paid has remained steady at 9 basis points on deposits while at the same time we have grown those deposits, 5% year-over-year or $58 billion. On lending activity, we\u2019ve been in a lot of discussion regarding a slowdown and our core middle market business representing the broad base of American companies, our business loans grew 7% year-over-year and our smaller business segments business banking and small business were up 3% and small business had the best production quarter in its history. We assisted our markets clients with their financing needs, which also put capital and system for economic growth. All those growth occurred in the sub-2% GDP growth environment. Our clients stand ready to engage and are ready to grow faster as economy continues to grow and improve. Now, let me turn over to Paul to go through the other details about the quarter. Paul? Paul Donofrio : Thanks, Brian. I will start with the balance sheet on page six. Overall, end-of-period assets increased $60 billion from Q4. The growth was fairly evenly split between two elements. First, we saw higher trading-related assets in global markets business with incremental customer activity following a seasonal slowdown at the end of Q4; secondly, we had higher cash levels, driven by seasonal deposit growth, primarily from tax refunds. Deposits rose $55 billion or 5% from Q1 2016 and are up $11 billion from Q4. Q1 deposit growth was primarily driven by customer tax refunds in our consumer business. Loans on an end-of-period basis were steady with Q4 as solid commercial growth was offset by seasonal declines in credit card and runoff of legacy noncore loans. Lastly, common equity increased $1.3 billion compared to Q4 as $4.4 billion in net income available to common was reduced by $3 billion and capital returned to shareholders through dividends and net share repurchases. Global liquidity sources increased in the quarter, driven by higher deposit flows and bank funding. We remain well compliant with fully phased-in U.S. LCR requirements, book value per share rose 5% from Q1 2016 to $24.36. Turning to regulatory metrics and focusing on the advanced approach. Our CET1 transition ratio under Basel III ended the quarter at 11%. On a fully phased-in basis, compared to Q4, the CET1 ratio improved 20 basis points to 11% and remained well above our 2019 requirement of 9.5%. CET1 capital increased $1.6 billion to $164 billion, driven by earnings and the utilization of deferred tax assets offset by return of capital. The ratio also benefited from an $11 billion -- excuse me, a $14 billion decline in RWA, driven by lower exposure in our global markets business, lower card exposure and legacy asset runoff. We also provide our capital metrics under the standardized approach, which remains relevant for CCAR comparison purposes. Here, our CET1 ratio is 10 basis points higher at 11.6%. Supplementing leverage ratios both for parent and bank continued to exceed U.S. regulatory minimums that take effect in 2018. Turning to slide seven and on an average basis, total loans were up $21 billion or 2% from Q1 2016. Loan growth in our business segments was primarily offset by continued runoff in noncore consumer real estate loans in all other. Year-over-year loans in all other were down $23 billion. On the other hand, loans in our business segments were up $44 billion or 6%. Consumer banking led with 8% growth. We continue to see good growth in residential mortgages, although originations slowed in Q1 2017, given the increase in mortgage rates in Q4 and Q1. We saw growth in credit card and vehicle loans. Home equity pay-downs continued to outpace originations. In wealth management, we saw a year-over-year growth of 7%, driven by residential mortgages. Global Banking loans were up 4% year-over-year. Loans in our commercial business grew 6% year-over-year, despite a slight reduction in commercial real estate. We think these growth rates are responsible given the economy grew around 2% year-over-year. Middle market revolver utilization rates have now climbed back to record levels. On the bottom of the chart, note the $58 billion, 5% year-over-year growth in average deposits, which is driven by 10% growth in consumer banking. Turning to asset quality on slide eight. The stability of our asset quality and loss trends reflects many years now of disciplined client selection and strong underwriting practices that are foundational to our responsible growth and through-the-cycle performance. Credit quality remains strong. Total net charge-offs of $934 million or 42 basis points on average loans increased slightly from Q4 due to expected seasonality in our credit card products but were down 13% from Q1 2016. Provision expense of $835 million rose $61 million from Q4 but was down $162 million from Q1 2016. Net reserve releases in the quarter of $99 million was fairly consistent with Q4 and the year ago quarter. Note that Q1 2016 included a significant increase in reserves and global banking for energy exposures that was mostly offset by releases in consumer reserves in that quarter. Our reserve coverage ratios -- excuse me, our reserve coverage remained strong with an allowance to loan ratio of 125 basis points and coverage level three times our annualized charge-offs. NPLs and reservable criticized exposure both declined notably. On slide nine, we breakout credit quality metrics for both our consumer and commercial portfolios. On the consumer chart, you can see the impact of the seasonal increase in credit card losses. Note that delinquency trends remain low and improved modestly from Q4; commercial losses continue to be low. Turning to slide 10. Net interest income on a GAAP, non-FTE basis was $11.1 billion, $11.3 billion on an FTE basis. NII improved $730 million from Q4, primarily due to higher rates. The net interest yield increased 16 basis points to 2.39% from Q4 as loan yields improved 17% while the rates we paid on deposits was flat at 9 basis points. Q4 and Q1 increases in long end interest rates resulted in slower prepaids and less premium amortization on our securities portfolio this quarter. Increases in the short end in terms of interest rates caused our variable rate assets to re-price higher while we maintain good pricing discipline on deposits. We also benefited from normal seasonality in Q1 in our leasing business. And in addition, we benefited from less unfavorable hedge ineffectiveness as compared to Q4. But, one can think of the reduction in the hedge ineffectiveness as roughly offset by two fewer days in the quarter. Now, as Brian mentioned, we remain disciplined around deposit pricing given the investment we have made and customer relationships through preferred rewards and other deepening activities. So, your natural next question is what should shareholders expect for Q2 with respect to NII, given the March rate hike by the Fed? Based on our models and assumptions, we believe NII should continue to improve, but the improvement is expected to be much more modest than Q4 to Q1 driven by a number of factors. Most notably, the increase in long-term rates in Q1 -- in Q4 and Q1 drove a significant portion of the Q1 improvement. In terms of Q2, think about it this way. Given where we are today with the Fed funds rate hike in March and the long end down since the end of the first quarter, I would focus you on our asset sensitivity disclosures. As of 3/31, an instantaneous 100 basis-point parallel increase in rates is estimated to increase NII by $3.3 billion over the subsequent 12 months, which is consistent with our position at year-end. Nearly three quarters or $2.5 billion of this modeling is driven by our sensitivity to short end rates. Given a one month LIBOR rise of about 25 basis points with the March hike and the long-end down, we should focus on the $2.5 billion short-end benefit; dividing that by four, get you a quarterly run rate of roughly $600 million for a 100 basis-point shock; assuming it\u2019s only 25 basis points instead of a 100 would get you to approximately $150 million benefit in the quarter. From there, we would expect continued modest growth in NII in the second half of 2017, assuming modest growth in loans and deposits and rates at least above where they are today. Turning to slide 11, non-interest expense was $14.8 billion. We were able to hold expense flat compared to Q1 2016 despite 9% growth in non-interest income and several other expense headwinds. The efficiency ratio improved 400 basis points year-over-year. And if you allocate Q1\u2019s $1.4 billion of incentive for retirement-eligible employees and the seasonally elevated payroll tax across all four quarters, then the efficiency ratio would be 62%. Our Company-wide simplification efforts and the $110 million in lower litigation costs offset a number of higher expenses year-over-year, including $150 million of higher incentives for annual retirement-eligible employees and seasonally elevated payroll taxes; $190 million of higher incentives associated with revenue growth across wealth management, global banking and global markets, and $160 million of higher expenses due to changes in our share price with respect to accounting from employee stock based awards. The year-over-year swing is caused by the share price decline in Q1 2016 compared to an increase in Q1 2017. We also had a $100 million in higher quarterly costs for FDIC assessments. Finally, note that employees are down 2% from Q1 2016 and we continue to add client-facing associates. Turning to the business segments and starting with consumer banking on slide 12. Consumer banking had another solid quarter. This segment produced $1.9 billion earnings, growing 7% year-over-year and returning 21% on allocated capital. Note that that 21% return is on $37 billion of allocated capital, which is an increase of $3 billion this quarter, given growth in their loans and deposits. On a pretax, pre-provision basis, which adjust for the sizeable release of reserves in Q1 2016, earnings rose $559 million or 17%. Year-over-year average loans grew 8%, average deposits grew 10% and Merrill Edge brokers assets grew 21%. That drove revenue growth of 5% led by a 9% increase in NII from Q1 2016. Note that the rate paid on deposits in this business declined 1% -- excuse me, declined 1 basis-point year-over-year to 3 basis points as a result of disciplined pricing. Non-interest income included improvements in service charges and a small increase in card income that was more than offset by decline in mortgage banking income. The decline in mortgage banking income was due to both lower volumes and less refinancing as well as our strategy of holding more of our production on our balance sheet versus selling it to the agencies. Through continued efforts to drive down costs, the efficiency ratio improved nearly 500 basis points to 53%. Cost reductions also helped drive the cost of deposits down 10 basis points from Q1 2016. Consumer banking credit quality remained solid with the net charge-off ratio declining 4 basis points to 121 basis points. Turning to slide 13 and looking at key trends. First, as usual in the upper left, the statutory reminder of our strong competitive position; second, as we point out each quarter, while we report NII and non-interest income separately, our strategy remains focused on relationship deepening and growing total revenue while improving operating leverage through expense discipline. So, as you review the top boxes on this page, note that we drove 8% operating leverage this quarter. Also, note that our relationship deepening is improving NII and balance growth while holding fee line flat as we reward customers for doing more business with us. Average deposits continued their strong growth, up $57 billion or 10% year-over-year, outpacing the industry. Importantly, 50% of these deposits are checking accounts, and we estimate that 89% of these checking accounts are the primary accounts of households. This means these are operational accounts used to pay mortgages and car payments and other bills. So, outflows chasing rates is less likely in our view. We also believe these deposit accounts offer clients significant value in terms of transparency, convenience and safety, which also means they\u2019re less likely to move their relationships. With respect to card, spending levels and new issuances were solid. However, the industry\u2019s trend of increasing rewards continues to mitigate our overall card revenue growth. Digitalization and other productivity improvements as well as lower fraud costs continue to lead expenses lower. Expenses declined 3% from Q1 2016 despite increases in the FDIC assessment rate and charges. Focusing on client balances on the bottom left, you can see the success we continue to have growing deposits, loans and brokerage assets. Merrill Edge continues to attract customers who want a self-service investment option as accounts are up 11% from Q1 2016. We now have more than 1.7 million households that leverage our financial solution advisers and self-directed investment platform. This quarter also included the successful rollout of Merrill Edge guided investing for clients who want some advice from our CAO office but don\u2019t desire a fully advised relationship. With respect to loans, residential mortgages continue to lead our growth. As expected, the sudden rise in long-term rates in late 2016 caused a noticeable decline mortgage production from Q1. While mortgage originations was down, we continue to hold more of our loans on the balance sheet. In Q1, we retained about 80% of first-mortgage production on the balance sheet. We believe retaining these mortgages will provide better economics over time plus retention deepens our relationship with these customers. Consumer vehicle lending remains solid, up 12% year-over-year, and we continue to remain focused on prime and super-prime borrowers. Our net charge-offs at 38 basis points remained not only low, but also lowest among peers. U.S. consumer card average balances grew 3% year-over-year, and spending on our credit cards was up 8% compared to Q1 2016. Turning to slide 14, we remain a leader in digital banking, and we continue to see momentum in digital banking adoption. Given the rollout of Zelle this quarter, Bank of America customers can now use their online app to transfer money, request money and to put bills person-to-person with more ease than before. While still in its infancy, customers sent $8 billion in payments to our person-to-person apps in Q1, which is up 25% year-over-year. Importantly, as digital banking adoption rises, particularly around transaction processes and self-service, we expect to see continued improved efficiency and customer satisfaction. Mobile devices now account for one out of every five deposit transactions and represent the volume of nearly 1,000 financial centers. Sales on digital devices continue to grow and now represent 22% of total sales. Still, with all the digital activity, we have not forgotten and remain focused on the 800,000 people walking into our financial centers across the U.S. on a daily basis. Many of these customers still use our branches to transact, but many others use our branches at financial destinations where they can learn more about products and services work face-to-face with the specialized professional and generally improve their financial lives. We want to encourage that and that\u2019s why, we have an extensive branch refurbishing underway. By the way, that\u2019s also helping increased customer satisfaction. We\u2019re also building new centers in markets where we have never had financial centers but where we have presence across global banking, wealth management or both. These markets include MSAs like Denver, Minneapolis and Indianapolis. In addition, we are testing smart centers, which utilize video assist, video assisted ATMs and other videos with conferencing capabilities in regions where it makes sense. Turning to slide 15. Let\u2019s review global wealth and investment management which produced earnings of $770 million and record pre-tax offering margin of 27%, while returning 22% on allocated capital. These solid results were produced in a period of change for the industry as firms and clients anticipate new fiduciary standards and other market dynamics such as the shift between active and passive investing. Net interest income rose 3%, driven by loan growth. Year-over-year, non-interest income also rose 3% as 8% higher asset management fees were partially offset by lower transactional revenue. Year-over-year, while total revenue grew 3% expenses grew 2% creating important but modest operating leverage. Also note the $29 billion of long-term AUM flows this quarter reflecting strong client activity, as well as the continuing shift from IRA brokerage to AUM. Moving to slide 16, we continue to see overall solid client engagement. Client balances climbed to nearly $2.6 trillion driven by market values, solid long-term AUM flows, and continued loan growth. Average deposits of $257 billion were flat compared to Q4, while ending deposits were down, primarily reflecting some movement to investment assets. Average loans of $148 billion were up 7% year-over-year. Loan growth remains concentrated in consumer real estate. Turning to slide 17. Global banking had record revenue this quarter, up 11% year-over-year led by investment banking activity. Revenue growth coupled with expense management, improved the efficiency ratio 500 basis points to 44%. In addition, provision expense of $17 million in Q1 2017 was more closely aligned with charge-offs, while Q1 2016 included approximately $500 million in reserve increases for energy exposure. This resulted in a 58% year-over-year improvement in earnings to $1.7 billion. Global banking continues to drive loan growth within its risk and client frameworks, albeit at a slower pace. Total investment banking fees for the Company were $1.6 billion which was up 37% from Q1 2016. By comparison, overall industry fee pools were up 19% year-over-year. A number of items to note given the strong performance. First, this was a record Q1 in terms of revenue from IB fees. Client underwriting activity in the capital markets was quite strong. We also earned record M&A fees this quarter with involvement in 6 of the top 10 completed transactions. Debt underwriting was up 38% year-over-year, led by strong performance in leverage finance. Equity underwriting was up 65% year-over-year. Expenses decreased from Q1 2016 despite higher revenue related incentives, higher FDIC insurance costs, and cost associated with adding 340 new relationship managers over the past couple of years. Return on allocated capital increased to 18% despite adding $3 billion of allocated capital this quarter. Looking at trends on slide 18 and comparing to Q1 last year. Average loans were up $14 billion or 4%. Growth was driven by our commercial bank where lending was up 6% despite subdued real estate lending. As Brian said, we feel good about this growth rate, given 2% GDP environment. We stand ready to support clients who want to borrow directly from us or tap the capital markets. One of the benefits of our universal banking model is our ability to deliver for clients across a complete product set and geographies. Average deposits increased 2% from Q1 2016. As expected, we saw a seasonal decline in deposits from Q4. We remain mindful of LCR rules as we grow deposits. Switching to global markets on slide 19. The business had a strong quarter, which once again benefitted from a breadth of or product and geographic footprint, with leadership positions in a number of areas. This quarter saw a strong issuer activity and tighter spreads across credit products which played well to our strength in mortgage and corporate credit. The business improved operating leverage with revenue excluding DVA growing 27% while expenses increased modestly after adjusting for litigation recovery in Q1 2016. Global markets earned $1.3 billion and returned of 15% on allocated capital. This includes a reduction of capital of $2 billion given the great work the team has done optimizing the balance sheet and reducing RWA in the past year. It is worth noting that we achieved these results with a lower bar and 6% fewer people than last year. With respect to expenses, Q1 2016 litigation included a sizeable litigation recovery; excluding litigation, year-over-year expenses were up 2% while revenue grew 19%. Moving to trends on slide 20 and focusing on the components of our sales and trading performance. Sales and trading revenue of $4 billion excluding net DVA was up 23% from Q1 2016. Excluding net DVA and versus Q1 2016, FICC sales and trading of $2.9 billion increased 29%. Within FICC, the year-over-year improvement was driven by improved client activity and corporate credit and mortgage products. Equity sales and trading was up 7% year-over-year to $1.1 billion. Despite weaker cash equity volumes, we saw increased activity in Europe and Asia across all products. We also are beginning to see the benefits of deploying additional balance sheet to meet the financing needs of clients. On slide 21, we show all other, which reported net loss of $834 million. This was an improvement from Q1 2016, driven by lower litigation and mortgage servicing costs. The only other thing worth pointing out here is a reminder that this is where we book the annual retirement-eligible incentive and elevated Q1 payroll tax before they get allocated out to the line of business throughout the year. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 26% and included approximately $200 million of tax benefit from the deductions on deliveries of share-based awards exceeding the related compensation costs. Our recent change in accounting rules requires booking this difference to the tax income expense instead of directly to equity. The effective tax rate would have been 29.4% excluding this benefit, which is in line with our expectation of approximately 30% for the rest of the year. Okay. A few points -- few summary points as I wrap up. This quarter shows the value of our businesses as rates begin to rise and as we experience increased capital markets activity. For years, we have stayed focused on growing responsibly, including staying within our risk and client frameworks and making our growth more sustainable by simplifying the Company and improving efficiency. In Q1, consistent with this strategy, we stuck to our strong underwriting standards while growing loans and trading assets. Asset quality remains strong and net charge-offs low. We grew deposits while managing deposit rate paid. We grew AUM while helping clients adapt to a changing industry. When client activity picked up, we were ready with a breadth of capabilities to raise capital and manage risk in major markets all around the world. We continue to invest in new technology and capabilities while adding sales professionals in certain businesses. We lowered non-personnel expenses, offsetting some seasonal and other expense headwinds this quarter. We created operating leverage in each of our business segments, and we returned more capital to shareholders than in any quarter since the financial crisis. These results tell us that responsible growth is working with more to come as the economy continues to improve. Many of you have been waiting patiently for us to approach our long-term targets. I hope you noted that if one allocates annual retirement-eligible incentives and seasonally payroll elevated tax throughout the year, we are basically at our return targets this quarter. We know we have more work to do to be consistently achieving all our targets, but we have more confidence than ever that responsible growth will get us there. With that, we\u2019ll open it up to Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll take our first question from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead, sir. Glenn Schorr : Hi. Thanks very much. First, a very quickie. Did you mention what NPLs you sold during the quarter and if there was any P&L impact? Paul Donofrio : Small and small. Small sales, small impact. Glenn Schorr : No problem. I\u2019m curious, I think we\u2019ve all taken note of the responsible growth, what you\u2019ve done, heard your comments on it relative to the economy. I\u2019m curious as we watch the industry loan growth come down for a bunch of different reasons, can BofA continue on this path? I don\u2019t want to say regardless of what the industry backdrop is, but can it buck the trend of the declining loan growth that we\u2019re seeing in most other places? Brian Moynihan : Glenn, it\u2019s Brian. I think at the end of day, banks reflect the economy and help make the economy happen. So, we\u2019ve been able to grow loans 5%, 6% in the core, so the middle market segment, 7% actually year-over-year. Credit card\u2019s been picking up a little bit, home equity\u2019s strong and residential mortgage down. So, if you look at it overall, we\u2019ve been able to outgrow the economy, but we\u2019re going to be dependent upon, the economy keep growing, but what we\u2019re showing across last couple of years with the discipline we have, driving deeper penetration or customers working hard on our relationships, even with repositioning portfolios, you can see in some of the slides and/or making sure that we maintain great discipline, we\u2019ve been able to grow the mid single digits as we\u2019ve told you against the backdrop of economy growing 1.5% to 2%. If that grows faster, we\u2019ll grow faster; if that stays in that range, we should be able to continue to grow at that level. Glenn Schorr : Okay. Maybe on the credit front, as you\u2019ve mentioned, credit\u2019s awesome in most places. And I saw criticized credit came down with energy improving. Are there any areas that are criticized credits increasing like something like retail? Paul Donofrio : No. Credit looks good across the board, and it\u2019s performing as we model and expect. Glenn Schorr : Okay. Lastly, little one. You mentioned the increase in Zelle activity. Do you make money on that or is that mostly a customer retention tool? Brian Moynihan : I think, Glenn, think about it this way is the way people pay each other. So, we don\u2019t charge for it. It\u2019s just service as part of a core DDA account, just like checks or just like an ATM card would be to withdraw. It\u2019s just more efficient for the customer, more efficient for us too ultimately, because the payback will be taking cash out of the system. And so, year-to-date we\u2019re up about -- even before Zelle is announced, for the first quarter, P2P payments Bank of America of 25% first quarter of 2017 versus first quarter of 2016. So, this is growing fast and will continue to grow. And what we\u2019ll do, we\u2019ll swap out other payment forms which cost us more to execute, but it\u2019s free to customers. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from John McDonald from Bernstein. Please go ahead. John McDonald : Good morning. Paul, just a clarification regarding the second quarter framework you\u2019ve provided for net interest income. Does the $150 million potential bump based on disclosures include the benefit of loan growth or was that just a rate impact, and could it be a little better if loan growth continues? Paul Donofrio : Well, the loan growth is embedded in our 100 basis-point shock. So, theoretically, it includes it. But if loan growth is little better than we think, it could be better, lower, it could be less, that\u2019s one of the variables that we have to think about when we think about NII growth. John McDonald : Okay. Brian Moynihan : John, just one thing to keep in mind there is, remember, we just capitalized or put in the run rate, for lack of better term, $600 million plus fourth quarter, first quarter, and this is on top of that. So that first benefit you think for the year, that benefit is now locked in and moves its way through the system. John McDonald : Got it, so that\u2019s incremental to the 1Q print? Okay. And then, can you remind us what kind of the project repricing beta you assume in the disclosures, Paul? Paul Donofrio : Sure. So 100 basis-point rise on interest bearing deposits, and remember we have a large amount of non-interest bearing deposits, but on interest bearing deposits, we\u2019re kind of low 50ish but that\u2019s full 100 basis points rise. As you can expect, the first 25, 50 of the 100 is going to be a little bit different than the second 25 or 50, and that\u2019s about as much that I want to give you, given the competiveness around this topic. John McDonald : Okay. Separate question on capital, with the CET1 at 11% now versus the 2019 requirement of 9.5%, what kind of buffers are you thinking of holding and what level of CET1 feels like the right target for you longer term? Paul Donofrio : So, with respect to buffers, I wouldn\u2019t want to give an exact number for all sorts of reasons. We put a lot of thought into how we manage our capital and liability structure including buffers. Having said that, we have 150 basis points of cushion right now on fully phased-in minimums and a lot of time between now and 2019. So, maybe we\u2019ll talk more about it as we get a little closer but right now we feel good where we are. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Steven Chubak with Nomura Instinet. Please go ahead. Steven Chubak : So, I just want to kick things off with the question on the 2018 expense target of $53 million that you guys had outlined on previous calls. Can you just remind us what the revenue growth assumptions were underlying that target? And just giving some of the acceleration that we\u2019ve seen in fee income growth and the higher incentive comp, is that still an achievable target in your view? Brian Moynihan : The revenue growth assumptions were like we said, if long-term we believe we can grow faster than GDP that growth, and that\u2019s embedded in those assumptions. I think the way for you Steve to think about is look at the global markets year-over-year and what you see there is with that substantial rise in revenue, the expense growth absent, last year we had a credit and litigation issue, we had an expense, so you had a pretty good reversal there; absent that, it was 2% growth and as Paul said, had 6% less people. Comp expenses were up a bit, even though revenue was up quite a bit. So, we can manage against that with the inevitable thing that if revenue grows faster, we may have a little bit more expense pressure. But I think you know we\u2019ll be very happy to see that happen. Paul Donofrio : The only thing I would add for the record is when we gave that guidance around this time last year, we specifically said it was based upon the economic environment at that time and that if things got better, we\u2019d have to adjust; if things got worse, we have to adjust. Having said all that, that\u2019s just for the record, having said all that, we\u2019re still focused and confident we can get to the 53, approximately 53 for full year 2018. That\u2019s what we said. Steven Chubak : Got it. And then just one question on the provision outlook, just given the continued favorable credit and delinquency trends, how should we be thinking about the trajectory in the near-term. Is the run-rate of just around $850 million plus or minus a reasonable target? Paul Donofrio : The way I would think about it, in Q2 provision should roughly match net charge-offs. But remember, we\u2019re bouncing around the bottom with respect to net charge-offs and commercial, so a material credit can move needle one way or the other. Absent that caution, we will build as we grow loan balances. But we should expect to see that offset perhaps by further runoff of non-core consumer real estate, and we have a high end user. Steven Chubak : Thanks, Paul. And just one final question on capital return, just touching on John\u2019s last question, how should we be thinking about the capital return trajectory given the 150 basis points of excess? And I\u2019m also wondering whether some of the recent rhetoric from the regulators suggesting a disinclination of sorts to have qualitative CCAR failures, whether that informs your approach at all in terms of future payouts? Brian Moynihan : I think we have been building our capital year-over-year, and you should expect us to continue to do that since we have both the strong cushion under CCAR. We\u2019ll see what this year\u2019s results, we don\u2019t know yet obviously. But from last year, just extrapolating and also our start point is higher, and our run rate of earnings is now very consistent. So, capital returns part of our story, and we\u2019ll continue to pursue it. Paul Donofrio : We\u2019ve made progress every year, you\u2019ve seen that. And I would remind everybody that we tapped the de minimis last year as well. So with the stability of our earnings, with the progress we\u2019re making on CCAR, as Brian said, we hope to continue to make progress. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Ken Usdin : Thanks. Good morning. Just first clarification, just coming back to the NII commentary, does the 150 also incorporate the extra day you get in the second quarter because that\u2019s usually pretty meaningful for you guys? Paul Donofrio : Yes, I would think about the extra day as kind of being offset by the seasonality we have in Q1 for leasing. Ken Usdin : Okay. So, you\u2019ve got -- you\u2019re saying you\u2019ve got a benefit in the first and that kind of washes to the second; so really, your net is the 150? Paul Donofrio : Yes, approximately 150. And as you know, there\u2019s a lot of things that go into that modeling. Ken Usdin : Understood. Okay, great. So, on the consumer fee side, I wanted to just ask, we saw kind of a little bit of a positive turn in both card income and also in the brokers line, which is the first time in a while we\u2019ve seen both of those move the right way. Any better line of sight at this point on just the trends getting better underneath the surface, whether it\u2019s the rewards competition or the fee capture pressures and brokerage kind of starting to get into the run rate, and we can kind of expect to see growth from here? Paul Donofrio : Look, we\u2019ve seen modest growth in card balances. We think that should continue. We\u2019re adding new accounts; we had 1.2 million cards this quarter. Combined debit card spend was good year-over-year and really good recently. But as you point out, the card income line remains I think in terms of growth, remains muted by competition around customer rewards. I guess what I would point out and just remind everybody is that just focusing on the fee income line sort of ignores some of the key benefits of our strategy, which is attract relatively higher quality card customers and reward them for deepening their relations with us. This strategy, we think is driving incremental deposit growth and making them stickier, and that helps NII. And by the way, these customers have lower loss rates as well as reduced need to interact with call centers, so that helps us lower costs. In terms of the service line or service charges, they\u2019ve shown some modest growth driven by growth in new accounts, and we expect that probably to continue here. Ken Usdin : And can you just touch on brokerage? Paul Donofrio : You mean brokerage\u2026 Ken Usdin : Wealth and brokerage. Paul Donofrio : Yes. Wealth and brokerage is being driven by the long-term trend that we\u2019ve been seeing with growth in AUM as transactional brokerage continues to decline. We saw it again this quarter. This quarter, we had significant growth in AUM, which offset that sort of continuing decline in brokerage. I think AUM fees were up 8% this quarter. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Betsy Graseck : Couple of questions. One on the expenses discussion earlier. On page four, you highlighted very clearly the strong operating leverage that you\u2019ve got year-on-year from various industries, various segments that you run. The question I have is, where should we expect the next leg of improvement on expenses could come from? Because one of the questions I\u2019ve gotten from people today is this is fantastic operating leverage, but where are the levers to take it further? Brian Moynihan : I think when we started few years ago at $70 billion operating expenses to bring it down to this level, it was more obvious. Betsy, now, it\u2019s everywhere, it\u2019s everywhere a little bit, everywhere a lot of hard work. So, headcount generally is drifting down on year-over-year term 4,000 or 4,000 people. That gets harder, but what we\u2019re doing is taking out people and putting them into the front-line in the client-facing roles. And so, we\u2019re seeing that shift go on, continue to work our real estate portfolio down, again through collocations and cities. So, you\u2019ll see us take three buildings in an area and put them in one, and you\u2019ve seen some announcement in that regard. In our data centers, we\u2019re accelerating the process, to consolidate data centers and that helps continue to knock down the number of data centers. It takes $0.5 billion investment to -- or $0.25 billion investment to build one to bring it on, and so you\u2019ll see that go on. And then, it\u2019s everywhere we turn, every place we look, just keep working at the pieces. By the end of the day, continue to watch the FTE headcount numbers drift down and also how we move those around from less managers to more client-facing people and less layers in the Company, which we\u2019ve been after. And so, it is just hard work and across the board using our simplify improvement, what we call organizational health going on in our company, and we\u2019re seeing the aspects of that. By the way, I think last year, in 2016, to give you example, I think we invested -- got about $400 million, $500 million in savings from some ideas, but it took us an investment of couple of hundred million dollars to get that. And so, even that investment rate is important to getting the sales out. And so, we\u2019re now asking to exclude but there is severance cost in here, there is real estate repositioning costs, all of that, which actually comes down as you get further and further towards the optimization level. Betsy Graseck : Okay. That speaks to why you can continue the revenue growth, but yet still bring the expenses down, got it. Two other quick ones. One on fixed income, you mentioned that credit was a source of strength this quarter; others have highlighted credit as a weakness. So, maybe you could speak to what you\u2019re seeing in your client base that drove such strong credit quarter in fact? Paul Donofrio : Well, first, I would say look, we\u2019ve been making a lot of investments on our global markets business across equity, across macro. Credit has always been a traditional strength of Bank of America Merrill Lynch, a lot of very strong bankers combined with strong sales and trading effort. Corporates raised money this quarter in the capital markets; we have strong relationships. So, we saw a lot of increased activity on the primary side which helps your sales and trading on the secondary side. That\u2019s one. Two, with spreads tightening a little bit, with clients activity picking up as they were repositioning given the change in markets, the change in spreads, again we have a strong corporate credit trading desk; we have strong special situations in credit; we have strong mortgage, and they just saw a lot of client activity, given what happened in the quarter. So, when we\u2019ve often said -- when client activity picks up, you\u2019re going to see this business reform. And for us, client activity was more this quarter and it showed up in our results. And again, lastly, it\u2019s impressive products, it\u2019s significant presence and scale in every major markets around the world. So, it\u2019s not just the U.S.; we saw activity in emerging markets around globe and we were there when our clients needed us. Betsy Graseck : Okay, thanks. And then, lastly, you mentioned on the call during the prepared remarks that you \u201cremain mindful of the LCR rules as we grow deposits\u201d. Could you elaborate on your thoughts behind that? Paul Donofrio : Sure. Particularly on the wholesale side, there are three types of deposits, fundamentally 25%, 40%, and a 100% runoff. And as we think about serving our customers and clients, we\u2019re very mindful of their needs. But we\u2019re also focused on maintaining those heavy deposits or of the highest quarter in terms of being able to use to lend out to customers. So that means you\u2019re going to focus on the 25 and 40 or the more deposits that are much more operational in nature. The deposits that we know are corporate and FI clients are using to run their businesses. We\u2019re focused on growing those deposits and we\u2019re focused on helping them use those deposits to pay bills and to move their money around, to do FX, all the things you might think an individual does but just on the corporate side. Those are the types of the deposits we\u2019re focused on; we\u2019re not -- we\u2019re respectful of clients who want to give us other types of deposits but we\u2019re having conversations about them, about the value of those and therefore what they should expect in terms of pricing. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead. Gerard Cassidy : Brian, when you look out longer term and if you turn back the clock when the industry before the financial crisis typically earned a 120 on assets, 130 basis points on assets and a more normal interest rate environment. What do you see for the long -- and I know ROE is what you\u2019re focused on and we all do. But from an ROA standpoint, when everything is going right for Bank of America, the expenses are where you want them to be, the margins are where you want them to be, what kind of ROA do you think this Company is capable of producing? Brian Moynihan : I think Gerard this is the focus we\u2019ve talked to you about getting above 100 basis points and with the adjustments of sort of smoothing out the first quarter little bit from the one time, annual expenses occur in the first quarter, you\u2019re getting close to that. That is not a aspiration goal which we\u2019ll stop at. I think it will improve if the rate structure continues to move up and the economy continues to grow, we\u2019ll get above that. But the first order business to get to that sort of we get the returns on tangible common equity and returns on equity where we want them to be. As you\u2019re thinking about that just more broadly, remember that we have a balance sheet of $2.3 trillion or so, and think about $500 billion basically being completely liquid assets. That is a far different cry than we were -- when our balance sheet was sort of at the high point, was $2.7 trillion, and we probably had $200 billion or $100 billion to $200 billion of high-quality assets or whatever the moniker we\u2019ve used back then. That\u2019s going to knock around your yields on your balance sheet. And so, we do focus on ROA in our Company; we also -- because basically is the thing that ultimately drive ROE, there is this equity builds, the ROE can be under pressure just from increases in equity. But, if you think about it, the real driver of the yield on the balance sheet has more to do with the amount of asset you are carrying which are under leverage for purposes of liquidity and safety and soundness. Gerard Cassidy : Right. Okay, thanks. And speaking of the lever on the equity, can you remind us what the risk-weighted assets are now for the operational risk for you guys? Paul Donofrio : Sure. We have $500 billion in RWA for operational risk, which is if I can go on a little bit, which is one third approximately of the RWA of the Company under the advanced approach and more RWA than we have for our credit. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And then, coming back to the combined payout ratio that you guys are striving for, within that, what should we envision, once you get your capital levels to the point where you\u2019re very comfortable with, is the dividend payout ratio of 30% to 40% a reasonable expectation down the road when things more normalize? Brian Moynihan : A couple of things. One is our capital is more than sufficient. We\u2019re very comfortable with it with the tangible common equity ratio, Gerard, thinking about before the crisis of 7.9% and a CET1 of 11%. It was a minimum of 9.5%. We\u2019re -- we have more capital than the Company needs by the different measures, whether it\u2019s a traditional market-based measure or a regulatory measure. So, we\u2019re completely comfortable with that. That leads us to return more capital. You should expect our dividend payout ratio -- for the bigger companies, I think there\u2019ll be more focus of keeping that to 30% level that\u2019s been talked about in the various rules and regulations. And if you go back three or four or five years ago, I spoke to that at one of our industry conferences, I think if you look across time, that level of -- if you think about that level of payout against the earnings stream, there\u2019s very low probability that you\u2019ll have real danger in the dividend -- continuing that dividend even in tough times. So, our goal is never to keep the dividend stable and then use the excess capital to buy the stock back at around book value, we think it\u2019s fair trade. Gerard Cassidy : Paul, just circling back to your comments about the FICC, the strength in FICC, the client activity was strong. Can you give us some color on the clients? Was it primarily investment clients or pension funds, hedge funds? What type of clients did you see that strengthened the activity? Paul Donofrio : I think it was -- the only way to really classify it is really across the board. I think we have strength in all of those client sets. It was just a lot of good sales and trading activity driven by client interest and repositioning their investments, but also again driven by prime new issuance of our clients. We just have a very broad and diverse product set in FICC, both from a product perspective and geographic perspective, and that kind of footprint and that kind of diversity when clients want to make changes, we\u2019re a natural call. Gerard Cassidy : Great. Thank you. And Brian, thank you batting cleanup and not lead off; it made a lot easier for all of us today. Thanks. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Saul Martinez with UBS. Please go ahead. Saul Martinez : Hi. Good morning and congratulations on the results and on the progress. Couple of questions, first, can you comment on the sustainability broadly of your returns in your markets and banking businesses, 15% return on allocated equity and markets, 18% banking despite the fact that you increased your capital allocation there? Obviously, if you can sustain those kinds of returns, it goes a long way towards helping you hit your 12% RoTCE targets on a sustainable basis. So just can you comment broadly on how confident you are that in your ability to say hit sort of mid-teen returns in those businesses? Paul Donofrio : We have been getting in global markets a double-digit return now for a number of quarters. It\u2019s been 10ish, 11% range for a number of quarters. So, we feel like in global markets, we\u2019ve made a tremendous amount of progress in improving returns. In global banking -- and remember, this quarter, we made this 15%, but this quarter, I think we had a very strong quarter in sales and trading. Our performance in global markets is going to be a direct result of client activity as we say every quarter. So, when client activity is lower, our results will be lower, but through a number of different quarters now with varying amount of client activity, I think we\u2019ve been able to get 10% or more return on equity. So that\u2019s how I\u2019ll answer it from that perspective. In global banking, again those returns are somewhat dependent on client activity in investment banking, but there I think the global banking segment is less volatile with respect to returns tied to the investment banking fee pool in any given quarter. We\u2019ve got a diverse product set across treasury service, traditional corporate banking products and investment banking products and then from a client perspective with the full spectrum small, medium sized and large global companies. So there, I would expect us to be able to maintain that return level. Saul Martinez : Okay. That\u2019s\u2026 Brian Moynihan : The thing I\u2019d add to that is if you think about what we did, we took global banking, because we think that is an integrated business, was corporate investment banking with both corporate side and investment banking side or middle market banking what we call global commercial banking again with investment banking capital markets behind, obviously, less than GCIB. We split that out to show you that that business many years ago -- we broke global banking away from global markets to show the distinctness of business, the global banking was more of annuity stream driven by treasury services revenue, lending revenue and then investment banking fees, which ebb and flow based on client activity and returns are fairly consistent et cetera. The flip side was we also want to show I think doing this five-six years ago when we first did it, and have been doing it at ever since, and we are one of the few companies that does it on the global market side. You can see that there is actually more stability in that business in a lot of people\u2019s thought. So if you look on the low end, we might make $600 million, $700 million after-tax and high end we made a $1.3 billion this quarter. But you\u2019ll see this range, and if you look across years of quarters and look at comparative quarters, year-over-year because there is some seasonality, you\u2019ll see, it\u2019s relatively stable. And so, we sort of hit that double-digit level in the worst of quarters and during a year and in the best of quarters, it\u2019ll kick above it. That was again how Tom and the team -- Tom Montag and team run the business, the stability to put in. And then most importantly, was brining expense structure down dramatically five or six years ago, Tom and the team did by almost $1 billion in quarter in operating expense of markets business alone and then maintaining it there and continuing to push it down where revenues have stabilized and come back up. Saul Martinez : I mean, obviously one thing that\u2019s has been helpful for returns in banking is very benign credit environment, commercial charge-offs with 10 basis points this quarter. It hasn\u2019t really moved much in recent quarters. But, how should we think about more of a sustainable level and is there anything there that makes you think that you could start to see some sort of inflection or some sort of an uptick in terms of credit costs? Paul Donofrio : Are you referring to more sustainable on the net charge-off side? Saul Martinez : Yes, exactly on commercial. Paul Donofrio : I guess how I would answer the question is we have been -- we changed our underwriting standards years ago, we\u2019ve been focused on responsible growth now for a number of years, we\u2019ve been sticking with that improved client selection, heightened credit standards. So, the answer is we can\u2019t compare to a previous period in the Company\u2019s history. We\u2019re just going to have to see how this develops, but we\u2019re very confident. We don\u2019t see anything today as we look at what\u2019s going in the marketplace that would suggest we\u2019re at an inflection point. It doesn\u2019t mean that I won\u2019t be talking to you next quarter about having lived through an inflection point. But we\u2019re not seeing anything right now that would tell us that we should expect net charge-offs to rise in the near-term. And in the long-term, there is some seasoning going on in the credit card portfolio that we expect and we\u2019ve talked about before but outside of that, we feel good about where our credit quality is. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead. Brian Kleinhanzl : Yes. I just had a quick question. You are saying that both the business or the commercial customers and consumer customers are optimistic still. Did you see a change in that optimism over the course of the quarter and lower at the end of the quarter given what was going on with DC and everything else or was it fairly consistent? Brian Moynihan : I would say -- I could say consistent and if you look at spending, I think it actually maintained its pace through the quarter, as an indicator of their behavior March was a stronger month and the first two months of the quarter. And now you can get into day counts and movements around which we can solve but just we didn\u2019t see any fall off in terms of the behavior in spending which I think is a good indicator how we feel. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Matt O\u2019Connor: Hi. I just want to follow up on that net interest income one more time. I mean, it feels like the 2Q expectation is a little bit less certainly versus what I would have thought. And I guess I was trying to figure out, there is just some conservatism on the deposit or pricing assumption. I mean you talk about 50% but it\u2019s been really insignificant so far for the Fed hikes. I am trying to gauge is that conservatism on that; is it the fact that tenure has obviously come in a fair amount or some combination of both maybe? Paul Donofrio : So, I\u2019m not going to take you through the math again because the math is fairly self explanatory but there are a lot of assumptions or I should not call them assumptions, but there\u2019s a lot of things that go into modeling NII. You hit upon one of them. Obviously, we could have deposit daters that are different than what we\u2019re expecting as we\u2019re doing our modeling. The 50 basis-points obviously is for a full 100% shock. We\u2019re talking about a 25% shock. So, it\u2019s reasonable to expect that we would be lower than 50% for the first 25. I think the question is how low should we be, and we\u2019re just going to have to wait and see. We\u2019re very focused on the competitive environment. We\u2019re focused on the needs and wants of our clients, and we\u2019re focused, we\u2019re balancing all of that against what our shareholders would want us to do. So, we\u2019re just going to have to see how it develops, but there is lot of things that are go into the modeling of expected NII. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay, understood. And then just the impact of long-term rates, I mean, obviously, the comments you made on rate leverages for higher rates and your 75% lever on the short end, as we think about the decline here in loan rates if it holds, how frame kind of the drag on that, and I think it bleeds in over time, obviously not all at once? Paul Donofrio : Yes. The sensitivity on the long end is a function of being able to reinvest as assets mature at higher or lower rates than the average we have now and what it does to the amortization of our premium on our securities portfolio. The latter is a bigger driver in the short term; the former is bigger driver in the long term. If you think about the Company right now where long-term rates are, we\u2019ve said this on other calls, we\u2019re kind of pleased to be at equilibrium where an asset rolling off the balance sheet was being replaced by assets rolling on the balance sheet at roughly the same yield. I would say, we\u2019re in a little bit more positive place right now, where -- even where rates are having long-term rates have gone up here over the last two quarters. We\u2019re sort of in a position where an asset rolling off the balance sheet on average is being replaced by an asset coming on at slightly higher yield. So, I don\u2019t know if that helps you. Matt O\u2019Connor: Yes. It\u2019s very clear and very helpful. So, thank you. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead. Marty Mosby : Thanks. Two technical issues on the net interest margin, NII. When you look at the big benefit in net interest margin, it seems like you had several things like the hedge ineffectiveness and leasing that pushed the margin up and even though you can have NII growth, your margin may even kind of just flatten out. Is there kind of a bias towards margin just being little bit higher given some of those moving pieces this particular quarter? Brian Moynihan : Look, the bulk of the increase from Q4 to Q1, the $700 million, the bulk of it was due to rates. We\u2019d just highlight that there was meaningful improvement that was driven by the leasing seasonality. Think about it that as roughly the kind of improvement we get with an extra day in the quarter. And then there was, I think, significant improvement driven by the lack of hedge ineffectiveness in the first quarter relative to what we experienced in the first quarter. But the bulk of it was driven by rates. And if you think about the rate impact, more than half of the rate impact was driven by the long end as opposed to the short end. Marty Mosby : And I would just focus on the margin in the sense like it was rounded up because the things are going to help next quarter going to help NII, which may not help the margin. But then, the second question was when you look at your transfer pricing mechanism, I was curious because it doesn\u2019t seem like a lot of banks would have the benefit from rates showing up in corporate other. Is your mechanism where it\u2019s still spread some of that -- because that will matter on operating leverage for the business segments. So, are the segments on a benefit as rates go up more than corporate? It does seem like it spread out more than other banks. Paul Donofrio : I think over the longer -- any one quarter, it could be a little bit lumpy on how the Company overall benefits versus the segments. But, I think over time, over multiple quarters, the segments will benefit. It\u2019s just basically a function of how residual flows back to our segments. Marty Mosby : It is. It just seems like you\u2019ve got a good methodology that pushes to the segments, which is helping operating leverage in each of those segments as you\u2019re getting that benefit. Thanks. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Andrew Lim with Societe Generale. Please go ahead. Andrew Lim : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions, another NII question actually. I\u2019m just trying to understand the mechanics of how your guidance for 4Q for $50 billion uplift in NII for 100 bps shock has come down to about $3.3 billion there. If I understand correctly, the long end has increased. So, that reduces your guidance going forward, is that the way to think about it? Paul Donofrio : Yes. I think if you look at our disclosures, you\u2019ll see that the 100 basis-point rate shock at the end of the year was basically the same as it is right now. Here we\u2019re showing to what we reported at the end of Q3 being 4 points something. And that decline in benefit we experienced as rates rose, and that went into our run rate of NII as Brian mentioned earlier. Andrew Lim : What I\u2019ve got difficulty understanding is why a past movement in your loan rates should affect your future guidance going forward. So, if I think about hypothetically let\u2019s say the yield curve did actually go up by 100 basis points shock in the fourth quarter, then your guidance going forward will actually be zero -- is that the way to think that or am I missing\u2026 Brian Moynihan : You have to go back. If you look -- you can follow up the way afterwards. But if we think about -- we told you in the fourth quarter from the third to the fourth quarter, I think you maybe off a quarter, from the third to the third quarter, what we said is you basically capitalize into the earnings run rate that $2 billion difference is now in the earnings run rate. And that\u2019s what you are actually seeing and that\u2019s the benefit of the lift in rates especially in the short-term side. And so that\u2019s relatively stable now because the -- that piece went through it. So, Lee can follow up with you and take you through sort of the calculation. But it\u2019s because -- the good news is it showed up and earnings this quarter as we said it was. Andrew Lim : No, absolutely. I can see that. Just trying to see how that moves depending on the shape of the -- the shift in the curve. Brian Moynihan : Well, because the future investment rate on the long-term rates as it comes down, as you\u2019ll recall we talked about, affects our yields on our securities portfolio going forward. So, as we reinvest $20 billion plus a quarter. So, I\u2019ll get Lee to call you afterwards and take you through that. Andrew Lim : Okay. Thank you. Operator : And we have no further questions at this time. I\u2019d like to turn it over to Mr. Moynihan for any closing remarks. Brian Moynihan : Well, thank you all of you for your time. Just to remind you, this is a quarter where we showed our responsible growth coming through. Revenue growth of 7%, flat expenses, 700 basis points of operating leverage across our franchise, good client growth in each of the business and our asset quality remains strong. So, we look forward to talking in the next question. Thank you for your time and attention. Operator : That does conclude today\u2019s call. You may disconnect at any time and have a wonderful day.",

[Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn today's program over to Mr. Lee McEntire. Please go ahead, sir. Lee McEntire : Good morning. Thanks for joining us this morning to discuss the second quarter 2017 results. Hopefully, everybody's had a chance to review the earnings release documents that are available on the Bank of America website. Before I turn the call over to Brian and Paul, let me remind you we may make some forward-looking statements. For further information on those, please refer to either our earnings release documents, our website or our SEC filings. With that, I'm pleased to turn it over to Brian Moynihan, our Chairman and CEO, for some opening comments before Paul Donofrio, our CFO, goes through the details. Over to you, Brian. Brian Moynihan : Good morning and thank you for joining us for our second quarter results. This quarter represents another solid example of driving responsible growth here at Bank of America. We're staying the course and executing against our responsible growth mantra has allowed us to gain market share and grow revenue. That mantra drives the way we manage our cost effectively while at the same time making continued large investments in people and technology for the long term value of this franchise. That mantra allows us to manage risk well, whether it's credit, market, operational or reputational risk. That mantra also drives an appropriate pace of growth and a modest GDP environment while holding credit cost down. All of this has resulted in significant operating leverage, leading to strong earnings growth and supports our plan to deliver more capital back to shareholders. Through the first six months of 2017, we have more than doubled the amount of net share repurchase and dividends to shareholders compared to the first half of 2016. As a reminder, with successful CCAR results behind us, we announced plans on June 28 to deliver $17 billion in capital back to shareholders over the next 12 months through higher dividends and net share repurchases. For the quarter we produced net income of $5.3 billion after tax, growing 10% compared to last year's second quarter. Now that was driven by continued strong operating leverage across the franchise. Our efficiency ratio reached - touched 60% this quarter. In addition to the net income improvement, a 2% reduction in diluted shares resulted in a 12% improvement in diluted EPS. Year-over-year net interest income improvement of nearly $900 million drove revenue growth proving the value of this deposit-rich franchise. We continued also to make progress on our returns and our return on tangible common equity moved above 11%, the first time despite increasing capital levels. As we look at the next slide on first half line of business results, I'm going to let Paul talk about the details of the quarter in a minute but I wanted to highlight basically two things. First, momentum in the businesses has comparing the first half of this year versus the first half of last year, and second, a focus a bit on our Consumer business as it reached $2 billion in after tax earnings this quarter. So the broad statement each business segment grew earnings and capital and it had its reporting returns well above our cost of capital. Consumer banking produced $3.9 billion in after tax earnings for the first half of the year growing 14% from 2016. This was achieved with good revenue improvement in controlling costs and driving operating leverage while maintaining great credit quality. Our Global Wealth and Investment Management business recorded first half earnings of $1.6 billion, up 9% year-over-year with a 27% profit margin. Both of these are records for this business. Our GWIM business has seen assets under management flows at $57 billion in the first six months of the year. This strong performance considering an industry is navigating many changes, both from the customer side and the regulatory side. While we've been growing and having strong margins, we've been investing in Merrill Lynch one platform, our Merrill Edge platform and other many investments who are providing great transparency for clients allowing us to lower our cost. Our Global Banking business serving commercial customers and commercial lending Treasury Services investment banking produced first half profits of $3.5 billion after tax. Earnings up 36% from last year with strong operating leverage on operating basis and lower credit costs. And even though this is our most efficient business at 43%, we continue to make investments in both technology and people. This quarter for example, this year we've rolled out our cash for customer interface for mobile devices making that cash management services more convenient for our clients. And over the last few years, we've embarked to increase our local market coverage by just simply hiring more bankers. We've hired nearly 400 bankers over the last couple of years and we have continued to hire more and we'll hire 200 more by the end of next year. And finally, when you look at our Global Markets business, they're in $2.1 billion in the first half and generated 12% return on its capital. We grew our sales and trading revenue, excluding DVA in the first half of 2017 versus the first half of the prior year in this case 2016 for the first time in five years, the first half grew faster than the previous year's first half. This growth combined with continued expense discipline drove that improvement. So in general, all our businesses continue to improve, and now I want to focus a second on our Consumer business and you can see that on Slide 4. So given the $2 billion earnings milestone, I want to talk about and focus on the multi-year effort this business is going through. This change really began around 2009, when we had more than 6,000 financial centers, 100,000 associates and about one-third less deposits. And at the time, we had some digital banking capabilities but nothing near what we had now. The team has worked hard over an extended period to produce the result you see today. Not only have they significantly reduced headcount. We've done that while adding more and more sales and relationship teammates. We've not only reduced financial centers, but we've invested and refurbish many and added others in markets we didn't previously serve. And we've continuously invested heavily in technology to drive innovation to keep up a customer behavior changes, and all during this our customer experience continues to improve. As you go to Slide 4, you can see some of the trend of results just for last four years. In 2014 due to all the changes that you're all familiar with, the revenue had decline in this business because the regulatory changes into focusing more on our direct business to our consumers as opposed to some indirect businesses. As you can see also from the crisis forward, we had focused on underwriting prime and super-prime customers and you can see that in the change in total net charge offs that occurred prior to 2014 and it remains in good stead over the last four years. At the same time will this credit costs have come down, our risk adjusted revenues have been improving. Also you can see our expenses in a lower right hand side continue to drive tremendous operating leverage leading to that net income growth. Today's business operate to the 52% efficiency ratio and with continuing to drive the customer behavior changes, continued investments for further cost improvements, we expect that to go lower. Continuing on Slide 5, you can see some of the other changes in the business that have enable us to make this change happen. How do we make this happen? We do it by optimizing and driving technology and enhancements for our customers, for our teammates, and ultimately for the benefit of our shareholders. This sustained level investment's is also validated by the top tier rankings by third parties, whether it's in digital banking or mortgage bankers Zellman operations or Merrill Lynch, and they continue to enhance these offerings. This quarter we launched new capabilities for car shopping and financing of those cars through mobile and add new person to person features through our partnership with Zelle. We've also rolled out small business capability to respond fast to the needs of the small businesses we serve across America. We can't emphasize enough of the positive impacts of all these investments especially in mobile and digital have made an improvement. As mobile banking users, you can see have grown to $23 million at the end of the second quarter. Rapid adoption in digital is shown on the charts, you can see on the interactions on a lower part of the page. This quarter we broke through the 1 billion interactions digitally with our customers. That's 1 billion in a new quarter. When you look at deposit transactions you can see the 21% of our deposits are made through mobile devices today. That's the equivalent of what a thousand financial centers does. That's important for client satisfaction. It is also important because those costs one-tenth of what it cost to do it over the counter. Once customers got used to transacting, we're now using devices in a broader sense. You can see in the core of 370,000 the points were set up on a mobile device to come to the branch. When they come to the financial center, we're in better shape to serve them because they know what they're coming for, and we know what they need. In addition, sales and digital devices are up to 22% of our account in loan sales. So then we switch the payment side. Payment volumes have been increasing over this time period, but electrification payments shows increased adoption of mobile banking and other digital payment methods. You can see the lower part of the page on the left hand side of what payments have grow 4% overall, digital has grown as 8% pace where non-digital is relatively flat. Our latest push that we made, a lot discussion about with all of you has been person to person. This is an important payment stream that we are driving. It's already sizable, but it still only accounts for 3% of the total payments in our consumer business this quarter. It's still an early adoption, but P2P customers sent $18 billion in payments for our platform of quarter two. This is up 20% percent year-over-year. So people focus on all the digital activity, but the same time, we have 100,000 customers today come into our financial centers. These financial centers serve those customers well, not only helping them transact when they need too, but more importantly, help pay for their financial needs and by serving where the products and capabilities that we have with a face to face specialized professional. We're continuing to invest in that branch structure and that's all on the run rate you see today. We have now built or refurbished 290 centers over the past 12 months, and expect to have completed more than 1500 by the year end 2019. In addition, we have upgraded our ATMs or are planning to upgrade all ATMs and we'll finish that by the end of 2019 as well. That's 16000 new teams over three or four years. All that has led to customer satisfaction levels which has reached the highest level in our history. So for the end of the day, our consumer business is an example of drive responsible growth, growing with no excuses, doing it on a right way the customer, doing it and managing risk well and importantly doing on a sustainable investment basis investing in the future or producing great returns in the current. With that, I want to turn over to Paul for some more details about the quarter. Paul Donofrio : Thanks Brian. Good morning everybody. I'm starting on Slide 6. As Brian said, we earned $5.3 billion or $0.46 per diluted share with EPS increasing 12% percent versus Q2 '16. Revenue of $22.8 billion is 7% percent higher than Q2 '16 and expenses of $13.7 billion was 2% higher than Q2 2016. The quarter included a few noteworthy items. First, we completed the sale of our U.K. consumer card business during the quarter resulting in a small after-tax gain. The transaction added roughly 12 basis points to our advanced CET1 ratio through both additions to CET1 and reductions in RWA. A pre-tax gain of roughly $800 million recorded than all other reflects a number of factors, including a premium on credit card receivables sold and the monetization of goodwill. It also reflects the recognition in other income of currency hedging gains and transaction losses from currency fluctuations that were previously recorded in OCI. Lastly, we recorded tax expense associated with the currency hedging gains, which drove our effective tax rate higher in Q2. After tax, the gain added about $100 million to earnings. The sale completes the transformation of our consumer credit card business from a multi-country, multi-brand business to a single brand business serving core retail customers in the United States. As usual, we also note DVA for you. This quarter net DVA was a negative $159 million, which was similar to Q2 2016. We also recorded a couple of charges and expense that are worth mentioning. The first is a $300 million impairment charge related to a few data centers we are in the process of selling. The second is severance costs which were approximately $100 million higher than Q2 2016 Provision expense 726 million compared to 976 million in Q2 2016, as net charge-offs of 908 million improved versus Q1 and year-over-year. And as Brian mentioned, ROA and ROTC approached our financial targets improving both on a year-over-year basis and on a linked quarter basis. Turning to the balance sheet on Slide 7. Overall, end-of-period assets increased a modest $7 billion from Q1 despite the sale of assets totaling $11 billion associated with the U.K. card business. We increased assets associated with our trading business as we continue to invest in our clients, particularly in our equities business. These increases in assets were offset by a decline in cash driven by seasonal deposit outflows associate with tax payments and a shift from deposits to a AUM brokerage and our Wealth Management business. When looking at deposits on a year-over-year basis, they are up $47 billion or 4% from Q2 2016 driven entirely by our consumer banking business. Loans on end-of-period basis were up $11 million from Q1 as broad based growth across consumer and commercial loans was modestly offset by the run off of legacy non-core loans. It's worth noting that this loan growth excludes U.K. card. These card loans were move from the assets of business held for sale when we announced the transaction in Q4 2016. On the liability side, long term debt increased $2.5 billion during the quarter to $22.4 billion as we increased issuance to meet TLAC requirements. Given our progress in the first half toward the requirements, we currently expect to issue less debt in the second half of 2017 as compared to the first half. Global liquidity sources were $515 billion this quarter and we remain compliant with fully phased in U.S. LCR requirements. The asset composition of our global liquidity sources is materially the same as high quality liquid assets as defined under the U.S. LCR rule. However, HQLA for the purposes of calculating LCR are reported not at their fair market value, but at a lower value which incorporates regulatory haircuts and exclusion of excess liquidity held in certain subsidiaries. Therefore, the HQLA on a net basis when reported will be lower than our current GLS number. Common equity increased $2.8 billion compared to Q1. This increase was driven by $4.9 billion of net income available to common and improved OCI of $700 million offset by common dividend and net share repurchases totaling $2.8 billion in the quarter. Tangible book value per share of 17.78 increased 6% versus Q2 16. Turning to regulatory metrics and focusing on the advanced approach. Our CET1 transition ratio under Basel 3 end of the quarter at 11.6% on a fully phased in basis compared to Q1 the CET1 ratio improved 50 basis points to a 11.5% and remains well above our 2019 requirement of 9.5%. CET1 increased $4.4 billion to $168.7 billion driven by earnings, utilization of differed tax assets and less goodwill deductions given the U.K. card sale. These improvements in CET1 were partially offset by return of capital. The CET1 ratio also benefit from a $34 billion decline in RWA driven by continued optimization work including model improvements as well as the sale of U.K. card. We also provide our capital metrics under the standardized approach, while our RWA reduction was lower under the standardized approach. Our CET1 ratio still improved 40 basis points to 12%. Supplementing the leverage ratios for both parent and bank continue to exceed U.S. regulatory minimums to take effect in 2018. Turning to Slide 8, on an average basis total loans were up $15 billion or 2% from Q2 2016. Note that the sale of U.K. card lowered average loans by $2.9 billion. So you may want to adjust for that when studying growth trends. As usual loan growth was reduced by the continued runoff of non-core consumer real estate loans in All Other. Year-over-year loans in All Other were down $24 billion. On the other hand, loans in our business segments were up $39 billion or 5%. Consumer Banking led with 8% growth. We continue to see good growth in residential mortgages. We also saw growth in credit card and vehicle loans. Home equity originations are up nicely but continue to be outpaced by pay downs. In Wealth Management, we saw year-over-year growth of 7% driven by residential mortgages as well as structured lending. Global Banking loans were up 3% year-over- year. There was a lot of Capital Markets activity this quarter and this may have impacted more than usual loan growth among larger corporates as a number of funded bridge loans were paid-off and as borrowers substituted bonds for loans in a flattening curve environment. On the bottom right, note that we grew average deposits by $44 billion or 4% year-over-year. This growth was driven by our Consumer segment which grew deposits by 9% year-over-year. Turning to the asset quality on Slide 9. As I have emphasized before the stability of our asset quality and loss trends reflects years of disciplined client selection and strengthened underwriting standards along with an improving economy. While there is room in the industry for other strategies, we remain focused on responsible growth. Credit quality continues to be solid with net charge-offs, NPLs, delinquencies and reservable criticized exposure all improving from Q1. Total net charge-offs were $908 million or 40 basis points of average loans decreasing $26 million from Q1. Provision expense is $726 million declined $109 million from Q1 and was down $250 million from Q2 2016 driven by lower losses in consumer real estate and improvements across most of our Commercial portfolio particularly energy. Our reserve coverage remained strong with an allowance to loans coverage ratio of 120 basis points and coverage level three times our annual net charge-offs. Turning to Slide 10, we break out credit quality metrics for both our consumer and commercial portfolios. Asset quality metrics in consumer real estate continue to improve. Well net charge-offs were down overall. There are a few small items to bring to your attention. Within consumer, we had a small recovery on the sale of a legacy consumer portfolio. And note that one-third of the quarterly U.K. card losses went away with the June 1 sale. While U.S. card losses increased from seasoning they remain low. Consumer NPLs of $5.3 billion are at the lowest level since Q2 2008. NPLs came down from Q1 levels. And keep in mind that 43% of our consumer NPLs are current on their payments. Commercial losses were up modestly from Q1 driven by a couple of names. Turning to Slide 11. Net interest income on a GAAP, non-FTE basis was $11 billion, $11.2 billion on an FTE basis, compared to Q2 2016 which has the same day count and seasonal factors. NII is up 868 million or 9% driven by an improving spread between our asset yields and deposit pricing in an environment where both short-end rates and long-end rates increased. We also benefited from loan growth and excess deposits deployed in security balances. Compared to Q1 2017 NII was relatively flat, as the benefit from an increase in short-end rates was offset by a number of factors, including lower long-end rates in the quarter. First, we increased client financing activities and balances in our equities business to support clients and drive growth. Some of the products we use to accomplish this created interest expense with no interest income, instead they drove trading account profits recorded in non-interest income. Second, the U.K. card sale closed June 1. That was earlier than we expected. And so the quarter's comparisons the previous ones are negatively impacted by one-third of U.K. cards interest income. Third, we saw a decline in leasing interest from the seasonality we see in Q1, but that was offset by one additional day in interest in Q2 versus Q1. And then lastly, we experienced some negative debt hedging effectiveness. As a reminder, accounting rules require us to measure changes in the value of debt differently than changes in the value of a swap we use to hedge, creating temporary ineffectiveness that will revert to zero over the remaining life. As a general comment on deposit pricing, overall, we held pricing relatively stable in Q2. However, we did increase pricing for some commercial and wealth management clients late in the quarter, and this will impact Q3 NII. While holding pricing relatively steady, we were able to grow deposits 9% year-over-year in our consumer segment. Looking forward to Q3, please keep three additional things in mind. First with respect to rates, the most recent June short-end rate hike should benefit Q3 NII subject to continued stability and industry deposit pricing. But the Q2 decline in long \u2013end rates will have a negative lag effect in Q3 with respect to the write-off of premium associated with prepayment of mortgage-backed securities. Second, we will benefit from one additional day of interest. And third, going forward, we will also feel the effects of the full quarter loss of interest income from U.K. card equating to about $225 million. Having said all that, we would expect NII to be up compared to Q2 if the forward curve is realized and if we have some loan and deposit growth. With respect to asset sensitivity, as of 6/30, an instantaneous 100 basis point parallel increase in rates is estimated to increase NII by $3.2 billion over the subsequent 12 months, which is broadly in line with our position at the end of the first quarter and continues to be predominantly driven by our sensitivity to short-end rates. Turning to Slide 12, non-interest expense was $13.7 billion. As I mentioned earlier, Q2 included roughly $400 million in higher costs from the combination of impairment cost associated with the sale of few data centers and higher severance costs. Otherwise, litigation and other operating costs were lower. We feel good about our expense progress this quarter, especially in light of our continued investments in sales professionals and new technology. Also remember, we have 100 million in higher quarterly costs from FDIC assessments compared to Q2 2016. The efficiency ratio hit our 60% target this quarter, improving 300 basis points year-over-year. With respect to associate levels, on a full-time equivalent basis, we are down modestly from the prior quarter. Please note that we have changed our disclosure on employees from FTE to headcount this quarter. By the way, that was the same idea from one of our associates. FTE is much more complicated to calculate and less relevant today given our shift from part time associates, as you can see the headcount is down more than 4,000 from Q2 2016. Half of that decrease is driven by U.K. card and half by Consumer Banking optimization. Note, the continuing shift from non-client-facing associates to primary sales professionals, which now make up 21% of our headcount. Compared to Q1 2017 the release of associates from the sale of U.K. card was offset by bringing on 1,500 summer interns and hiring 1,000 primary sales professionals. Just a quick observation on these interns, we selected these 1,500 students from a 13,300 applications, as we continue to be an employer of choice. From a diversity perspective, 42% of these interns are female and 53% are ethnically diverse. Turning to the business segments and starting with Consumer Banking on Slide 13. Consumer Banking recorded their highest earnings in a decade. Earnings were $2 billion growing 21% year-over-year and returning 22% on allocated capital. The business created 900 basis points of operating leverage holding expenses flat while growing revenue 9%. Year-over-year, average loans grew 8%. Average deposits grew 9%, and Merrill Edge brokerage assets grew 21%, improvement in NII drove the 9% revenue growth, which was driven by an increase in the value of deposits given the rise insurance rates as well as solid loan growth. Note that the rate paid on deposits in this business remains low at 4 basis points, as we remained very disciplined in pricing. Non-interest income included improvement in service charges and a small increase in card income that was more than offset by decline in mortgage banking income. Through continued efforts to drive costs down, the efficiency ratio improved nearly 500 basis point to 52%. Cost of deposits fell below 160 basis points in the quarter. Consumer Banking credit quality remained strong with a net charge-off ratio of 121 basis points. Turning to Slide 14 and looking at key trends. Our strategy remains focused on relationship deepening and growing total revenue while improving operating leverage through expense discipline. The concept of total revenue is important, as you evaluate NII and fee movements. Mortgage banking income is lower driven by our strategy of holding mortgage originations on our balance sheet instead of selling to the agencies, we believe retaining these mortgages on our balance sheet provides better economics over time. In Q2, we retained about 90% of our mortgage production on balance sheet. Also note that our relationship deepening preferred rewards program is improving NII and balance growth while holding fee line flat as we reward customers for doing more business with us. Spending levels on debit and credit cards were up 6% year-over-year and new issuance of credit cards was a solid at $1.3 million, spending levels on cards drives revenue but are largely offset by rewards given back to customers. Focusing on client balances on the bottom left, you can see that the success we continue to have growing deposits, loans and brokerage assets. At the bottom right, you can see deposits broken out, our 9% year-over-year average deposit growth continues to outpace the industry while the rate paid remains low and stable. Importantly 50% of these deposits are checking accounts and we estimate 90% of these checking accounts are the primary accounts of households. With respect to loans, residential mortgage continues to lead our growth. We also saw growth in card and auto. Client brokerage assets are up 21% year-over-year, driven by strong client flows as well as market performance, new accounts grew 10% from Q2 2016. The digitization efforts that Brian discussed earlier and other productivity improvements continue to drive expenses lower, expenses were stable compared to Q2 2016 despite strong revenue growth and increases in the FDIC assessment rate and charges. We continue to remain focused on prime and super-prime borrowers with average book FICO scores of at least 160, excuse me, of at least 760. Turning to Slide 15, let's review a global wealth and investment management, which produce record earnings of $804 million, a pre-tax margin of 28% and a return on allocated capital of 23%. The industry continues to evolve as firms and client anticipate do fiduciary requirements and other market dynamics such as the shift between active and passive investing. At the same time, the financial markets continue to provide a tailwind to client activity and balances. We saw $28 billion of AUM inflow this quarter, continuing the strength of $29 billion in Q1, net interest income rose 14%, driven by an increase in the value of deposits given the rising short-term rates as well as an increase in loans. Year-over-year non-interest income improved 3%. However, note that in Q2 '16, non-interest income included a $60 million gain from the sale of a cash management capabilities as we transition from proprietary products to open architecture. Adjusting for the prior period gain, non-interesting income improved 5% as 10% higher asset management fees were partially offset by lower transactional revenue. Year-over-year expenses were up 3% from revenue related incentives as well as higher FDIC costs. Revenue growth outpaced revenue related expense producing solid operating leverage. Moving to Slide 16, we continue to see overall solid client engagement. Client balances now exceed 2.6 trillion, driven by higher market values, solid AUM flows and continued loan growth. Average deposits of $254 billion were down $12 billion from Q1, reflecting both normal seasonality from tax payments as well as client shifts to investment in AUM and brokerage. Average loans of $151 billion were up 7% year-over-year. Loan growth remained concentrated in consumer real estate as well as structured lending. Turning to Slide 17. Global Banking earned $1.8 billion in Q2. Earnings increased 19% from Q2 '16 driven by good results across investment banking and treasury services. Return on allocated capital was up year-over-year to 18% despite an increase in capital allocated to this business. A number of results to note, given the strong performance, record revenue in the quarter, record advisory fees, record first half revenue and net income, and year-to-date, we remain ranked number three in investment banking with fees of $3.1 billion. Year-over-year revenue growth of 7% coupled with flat expenses drove operating leverage of 600 basis points. Provisioning expense of $15 million in Q2 '17 is down $184 million, driven by improvements across most of the portfolio particularly energy. Global banking loan growth was 3% year-over-year. The pace of loan growth remains good, but has slowed, driven by both capital markets disintermediation as well as reduced demand from clients as they look for more certainty of economic growth. With respect to disintermediation, clients are using bond issuance to pay down loans and pay off funded bridges. Global banking held expenses relatively flat compared to Q2 '16 as savings offset higher technology investment. Looking at trends on Slide 18 and comparing to Q2 last year, average loans were up $11 billion or 3% with the exception of CRE, loan growth was fairly broad based with C&I loans, up 5% in middle market lending. Average patterns were stable relative to Q2 2016, NII growth grow the 7% year-over-year revenue increase. NII increased $286 million from Q2 2016, driven by an increase in the value of deposits, given the rise in short term rates as well as increase in loans, partially offset by modest spread compression on loans. Total investment banking fees of $1.5 billion were up 9% from Q2 2016, finishing strong in the last few weeks of the quarter. As I mentioned, record M&A fees drove the increase. Within debt capital markets we saw a solid increase in investment grade fees while leverage finance declined. Switching to global markets on Slide 19. The business had a solid quarter earning $830 million or $928 million, if one excludes net DVA. Global Markets generated a 10% return on allocated capital. Earnings were down relative to Q2 2016, which if you remember was uncharacteristically strong, given a rebound from a weak Q1 2016 and the Brexit vote. Just to complete the picture, remember Q3 last year was also a typically stronger than Q2 2016. 2017 has followed a more typical seasonal pattern so far this year while Q2 was solid, sales and trading excluding DVA declined 9% from Q2 2016. But comparing the first half results of 2017 to 2016, sales and trading ex-DVA increased 6%. This is the first time in the past five years that first half performance is up year-over-year. With respect to expenses, Q2 2017 3% higher than Q2 2016, driven by increased technology investment. Moving to trends on Slide 20 and focusing on the components of our sales and trading performance. Sales and trading revenue of $3.4 billion excluding net DVA was down 9% from Q2 2016 finishing ahead of our mid-quarter expectations. Excluding net DVA and versus Q2 2016, FICC sales and trading of $2.3 billion decreased14%. Within FICC, the year-over-year decline was driven by stronger rates in emerging markets in Q2 2016. Equity sales in trading was up 3% percent year-over-year to $1.1 billion benefiting from growth in client financing activity offset by slower secondary market revenue. On Slide 21, we show all other, which reported a net loss of $183 million. This includes the $100 million after tax gain associated with the sale of U.K. card. Revenue here also includes to roughly $800 million pre-tax gain from the U.K. card transaction which was almost entirely offset by related tax expense recorded here as well. Non-interest expense includes datacenter impairment charge, I mentioned earlier, which was mostly offset by lower personnel and other operating costs. When comparing expenses and earnings to Q1 2017 remember Q1 2017 includes seasonal retirement elevated incentives and elevated payroll tax expense of $1.4 billion. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 37.1%, which includes approximately $700 million of tax expense recorded in conjunction with the sale of U.K. card. We continue to expect an effective tax rate of approximately 30% for the rest of the year absent unusual items. Okay. A few summary points to wrap up, again this quarter we created operating leverage by managing expenses while improving revenue. For years, we have been focused on growing responsibly including staying within our risk and client frameworks as well as simplifying the company to improve operational efficiency all aimed at making our growth more sustainable. In Q2, consistent with this strategy, we stuck to our strong underwriting standards, while growing loans and investing in our clients in global markets. Asset quality remain strong as net charge offs, NPL's, delinquencies and commercial reservable criticized - and commercial reservable criticized exposures all declined. Several of the businesses set new records or revenue earnings. As we grow with our clients and manage cost well. Importantly, we continue to invest in new technology and capabilities, while adding sales professionals in certain businesses and we significantly increase the amount of capital we returned to shareholders and announce plans to increase that even more. These results tell us the responsible growth is working and that we are well positioned to continue to invest in and grow with our customers and clients as the economy continues to improve. With that, we'll open up the Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Glenn Schorr : I appreciate all the detail on the net interest income discussion. One piece of it on the repo borrowings part of it, financing - the equity financing side. I'm curious if you think of that as a little episodic and you just go with the flow. Or is it more a permanent part of the strategy where you are using your strong balance sheet to help grow? The tag along to that is if it is more permanent why do it through repo? Is that more expensive? Brian Moynihan : I think it's a little bit of both. So we did make a decision to invest more on our equities business this quarter. That's going to go up and down depending on client activity in every quarter. We could always change our mind. But generally we've made a decision to add more balance sheet to equities because we see an opportunity there and because our customers would like us to do that. In terms of how we add that balance sheet that definitely can change one quarter to another. This quarter it was a lot of synthetic which tends to happen when you have clients overseas who have some demand. Next quarter it could be more plain OPB and that does change the mix of NII when that happens. But it's based upon client demand not necessarily how we want to manage one part of the our P&L versus another. Glenn Schorr : And the tagalong for net interest income guidance is, as you mentioned, very low deposit beta on the consumer side, just two basis points up in the quarter. Is there a point in time where you expect that to accelerate over the next couple hikes? I know we all kind of ask the same thing each quarter, but it's amazingly low. Paul Donofrio : Yes, look we're watching it closely. I guess I would point out that Bank of America and the industry really haven't increased as you point out deposit rates on traditional bank accounts. I think we believe we deliver a lot of value to depositors. Transparency, convenient safety, mobile banking, online banking, nationwide network, rewards, advice and counsel. There's some real value to having a relationship with us and I think there's value plus the fact that there's been a lack of market pressure so far. There's a lot of on traditional accounts to leave rates relatively flat. We are starting to see some rate increases on some account types in GWIM and in Global Banking. And if you look at our models, they anticipate that we're going to have to start raising eventually based upon historical experience. But the bottom-line is, we're going to balance our customer needs and the competitive environment with our shareholder interest and do the right thing. So we'll just have to wait and see. Brian Moynihan : Glenn, I would just add, when you dig into the supplement and other materials and sort of look at similar business and even the GWIM business, we have to focus on the core checking balances in the consumer on a $650 billion deposit base or $320 billion. And so that is 10-years of hard work of driving core operating accounts the consumer with a core checking balances in the primary account record run near 90%, up from the 60s and 70s many years ago. And those are zero interest and they'll remain zero interest because that's the nature of the beast. So we will see other areas like CDs year-over-year down again 10%. And so, we have been driving this business to be core, core, and core and that's what's happening. And GWIM, you're seeing the pieces that were functionally investment equivalent move faster but we feel good about it. We feel good about how we're driving both the value to the consumer for the total of our services relative the interest rate paid on certain types of deposits and frankly relative to the non-interest-bearing deposits. Operator : And we'll take our next question from John McDonald with Bernstein. Please go ahead. John McDonald : Just to follow up on the NII, Paul, it sounds like when you net a few positives and negatives in terms of your NII outlook for next quarter you are expecting a modest increase in the third quarter as of now. Could you put any size parameters on that? Paul Donofrio : No, I think we want to get out of the game of putting size parameters on it. I've given you all the inputs I can run through them again, if you'd like. But look we feel good about where we are that we had some transient kind of things this quarter. There are a lot of variables that go into this. One of the biggest one is by the way predicting people's behaviors, predicting customer. So I wouldn't want to give you a number, if you want to be happy to go through kind of all the different ins and outs again, if you want, but\u2026 John McDonald : No, that's fine. Maybe you could just remind us how much the Fed hike itself - what your estimate of how much that helps the June hike. And then also just how much the lower 10-year hurt in the second quarter? How should we think about the 10-year impact going forward? So the short and the long end impacts would be helpful. Thanks. Paul Donofrio : Look, they - again, I won't give you a number, but the - we had a significant improvement in NII from the short-end, but the long end also did significantly impact us, relative to what we were expecting. Because, as you know, we have a securities portfolio and as rates change their customer behavior changes and we can amortize more or less of that premium. John McDonald : Okay. And then just on expenses could you help us think through the expense trajectory for the back half of the year? And more importantly, your current thoughts on the target for the $53 billion next year. And how some of the - maybe the tech consolidation you did this quarter, how does that impact either the timing or just confidence level on delivering expense saves? Paul Donofrio : Sure. We feel good about our goal. I'll remind everybody that some time ago now, we said that our full year 2018 expense would be approximately $53 billion. A lot has changed since then. Good, bad, or whatever, a lot of things have changed, but we're still very confident in that goal. To get there we feel like we need to run in a normal quarter at around kind of $13 billion and then you've got, into the first quarter that has $1 billion or so more in retirement eligible and FICO. If you look at our expenses this quarter, right, we reported 13.7. Last year we reported 13.5. If you back out the data center on the elevated severance, would be at 13 :3. So we think we made pretty good progress year-over-year and we just have to continue to make that type of progress over the next few quarters and we'll get there. Brian Moynihan : Effectively, John, it's about a $100 million step-down over the next couple of quarters, which has been relatively - very consistent with what we've been doing. Over the past several quarters, we used to have the major drops as we get a position, but it's going to have been $100 million-ish year-over-year step-down from the prior year, and so you'll see that kind of play out, we think. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead. Jim Mitchell : Maybe getting back to the deposit question. You guys are growing 9% in the consumer book better than the industry, despite holding low obviously reflecting your mix. How far do you think - A, I guess can you give your sense of what you think is driving that market share? And is this something where you are willing to test the patience of your customers to lag deposit rates until growth slows more materially? How do we think about what your decision-making process is in terms of rates in the consumer book? Brian Moynihan : Yes. I would make it. Jim I'd look more to the broader aspects of your question. Some of the statistics that I talked about earlier, what is been driving? This has been in end of the day to get ourselves position as the core transaction - in a transaction side of the consumer business is a core transaction provider to every household. And we have our checking account numbers are growing now couple of hundred thousand that new checking accounts this quarter type of numbers, but have been falling from $37 million and this small business consumer combined down to about 34-ish. And so we had run off a lot of stuff that were extra checking accounts and things like that starting 10 years ago frankly. And so that's what plays your benefit here because in the end of the day as rates continue to rise, if they continue to rise, the value of the consumer deposit franchise as being around this industry for a long time is going to be driven by the advantage and the checking balances and then some of the other balances will help, but there will be more rate sensitive. So it comes more from the operating business than it does from any strategy on actual pricing because those are free balances and remain free. So the question is how do you gain share and what you see is if you think about it year-over-year our Consumer Business grew about $60 billion and deposits around about half of that was in checking account balances, one half of that. And that is driven by the innovation I talked about a billion digital interactions this quarter $22.9 million active digital mobile customers 30 odd million active digital customers more and more capabilities there and becoming more and more embedded in everything that consumer does. And that that means you're gaining share against people don't have all those capabilities in our minds. And so as you think about it that's what's going to drive a lot of deposits value and if you look at some of the rates and volumes charts, even you get to be interesting things, we look at the corporation overall, year-over-year our deposit costs on interest-bearing not non-interest-bearing up $100 million, 60 of that was in the U.S. and 40 of it is on 10% the interest-bearing deposits outside the U.S. So there's not even that much movement on the interest-bearing part. So we feel good about the franchise and where we need to price because it's more investment orient say in the GWIM business. We've priced to maintain those balances. Half of went out of GWIM this quarter was us putting people into the market based on our allocation methodology. So irrespective of the rate that went into the market as opposed into other cash. So it really comes from all the different advantages we've been driving out to drive this franchise for 10 years. Jim Mitchell : Maybe, Brian, a follow-up on regulation. Obviously the treasury report seemed pretty favorable for the industry. You are not really leverage constrained. Is there any aspect of the recommendations that you would find most helpful to your business? Brian Moynihan : All of that would be helpful. There's a good amount of work that's gone in by all the industry groups, all the individual companies, and the administration to come up with a list of things that, our belief is we want responsible, clear, transparent, and regulation that helps maintain the safety and soundness and capabilities in this industries. There's no question, but in areas where things have gotten too far you've got to bring them back a little bit and that lottery list is really there to provide it. So while some are more important to our franchise than maybe other people's franchise and vice versa. The end of day a careful revisiting of some of these things to ensure that we maintain the safety and soundness while getting good regulation is critical, and I think hopefully the ball is moving forward on that. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Ken Usdin : If I can ask questions on the card business, first of all I noticed that the card losses were up first to second. They are typically down. I am just wondering if you can help us understand just where we are in the seasoning of the portfolio, also noting that the risk-adjusted margin continues to slip as well. So what do you think about card losses going forward and when do we see that bottoming of the card margin? Thanks. Paul Donofrio : Sure. So let's start with NCOs, charge-offs this quarter were 287, there were 266 last quarter, last year I should say. Both of those numbers and that delta is completely within kind of our expectation and modeling for the portfolio while within our risk parameters. As you think about what's going on here, we've got a portfolio, we've got a back book that is in great shape, that's getting smaller every day. And we've got a front book that we're growing that is seasoning. So that's what's driving up the NCO's in a natural way, very gradually, also a little different phenomenon going on sort of this year, obviously, there's some seasonality as you go throughout the year. So just think about the future, next couple of quarters we've got seasonality, which is going to be all else equal for the years normal it's going to be lowering the net charge-off rate. But you've got some season that's going to be increasing it, so we'll just have to see how that plays out over the next couple of quarters. What was the second part of your question? Ken Usdin : Just on the risk-adjusted - the card risk-adjusted margin. Paul Donofrio : Well, sure. I mean, a couple of things. One, I tend to think of it as opposed to the margin as put just the dollars that we're producing there. And we've got modest growth in the number of cards outstanding. We've got good growth in debit and credit cards spend. And just focusing on the margin, I think overlooks some key benefits of our strategy to attract relatively higher quality card customers and reward them for deepening their overall relationship with us. That strategy is driving incremental deposit growth and making those deposits a little bit stickier, so that it helps NII. It also - if you think what these customers they have lower loss rates and they tend to reduce their interaction with the call center. We also have a model that has lower acquisition cost in terms of those new cards. And that's how we think about it. If you just want to focus in on the risk adjustment margin that's going to - I think perform well in line with the industry and probably just a little bit lower, but we're more focused on total revenue. Ken Usdin : Understood. And if I can just ask one big picture one, all the points you made earlier, all the credit metrics are going the right way otherwise, NPAs, inflows, etc. Coming back into this point about where card is going and then just not seeing anything else, you guys have been at 40 basis points of losses. Any reason to see that changing really? And then do you still have some room for release as well given that? Paul Donofrio : Look absent some change in the world in the economic situation, we don't see a reason why that necessarily changes materially. I don't want to give you guidance, but that's kind of our view. In terms of releases, we are building. I just point out we're growing loans. We're growing card. Things are seasoning that seasoning. So we may have some releases, but I would more think of those releases as potentially offsetting some of that growth. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Betsy Graseck : Brian, two questions. One on the consumer banking efficiency ratio. You mentioned that there still is room for that to fall from the 52%, which is obviously very efficient as it stands right now today. And you indicated all various opportunities to drive incremental revenues at a much improved expense ratio with all the digital that you outlined earlier. But could you speak to how the branch network could also impact those numbers? I mean, your branch has been coming down about 3% the last couple of years. Is that the kind of pace that you think you are going to continue? Or does the digital improvements enable you to move even faster there? Brian Moynihan : Well I think Betsy be careful. There you have to go back to the broadest context which is the 6100 to 45. We got after this relatively early, and - and so we've got to down a level. We don't know where it goes from here, because it will be based on customer behavior demands. But if you go back, if you think about it, over the last several years, we've been adding branches in places like Denver and we'll continue to build out there. We have been refurbishing branches heavily across the whole franchise. That's all in this run rate you see. And that will continue in this is in - in an expectation I'm talking about. So we'll - think we'd have to down 15, 17 branches linked quarter, a 100 odd year-over-year, that'll continue to happen. But I think what you would expect is the efficiency of that system continues to improve dramatically. So let me give you an example, in Chicago we had to build one of these old big branches and what we've done is create a call center in there to and we have 70 teammates going to work in a call environment just to use up the physical space to keep the branch open as opposed to call closing the branch. So, if you think about it from that scheme because of the telephony capabilities that exist today, you could actually distribute phone calls down to individual people based on the number coming in and things like that local call. So we've done that in three or four markets. We continue to use up the excess capacity. So you wouldn't see a branch decline there but you'd see 80% of its real estate goes for a different purpose. So it's a very complex thing, and I don't like to get caught by numbers. I'd say that you seen us manage it well and we would expect to continue to manage it well in the future but we're not going to get ahead of the customer and create any disruption to the growth we're seeing in the core channel. Betsy Graseck : And then separately, you've spoken before about the op risk RWA burden that you guys have. We had some questions come in on how you are thinking improvements there could help you given that it's not directly in the CCAR stress test. But maybe you could give us a sense as to how you think any changes could help you given that it's not a constraining factor. Brian Moynihan : Right. I think you've seen them start to make improvements and changes have gone through in the overall advanced RWA operas being a portion of that. The change had been more in other areas quite frankly. We'll expect to see further, but you have to be careful at some point standardized been backs into your - and your constraint. And, so this will be a toggle between for a long time standard advanced was our need in over the years now it's coming down in advance. And so standardized at some point will kind of avail the improvement overall. And then we'll go to work on standardized quite frankly. So expect us to continue to work on optimization of balance sheet, really at the end of day, opening up the difference in our GAAP capital levels for lack of a better term in our regulatory cap levels so we're down RWA on advanced based down 30-odd billion this quarter. Expect that to continue improve but be careful at some point it hits the other side in a world we have so much excess capital as this kind of an interesting exercise. But in a world where we actually start returning that capital through our earnings we're going to have to continue to optimize both sides of that equation. Betsy Graseck : And then just lastly, you had a nice increase in the dividend. Could you just speak to how you are thinking about dividend payout ratios? Do you feel like you are where you should be given the business model? Or is there more room and if there is more room what the drivers are to affect that change? Brian Moynihan : We've always been clear that we in the guidance still relative the large banks is out there sort of 30% percent earnings to dividends and 70% to share buybacks. We think that the shares are a tremendous value and will continue to do that. And with $17 billion over the next 12 months we can make some headway. So think about 30/70 split for us in the large bank category I think that's a responsible place to be. Right now we're moving up towards that but we're not quite there. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead. Gerard Cassidy : In looking at your ROE, your returns on allocated capital in the Consumer and the Wealth Management businesses are very strong, well over 20%. Global Bank is 18%, Global Markets about 10%. Can you share with us how you are going to get the 8% ROE up let's say above your cost of capital let's say 10%? Is it going to be more coming from the Global Markets area or management of the capital or somewhere else? Paul Donofrio : Well, the first thing I would point out is that we have a goal to get our ROE up and we have a goal on return on tangible common equity. 1% ROE we're making a lot of progress return on tangible common equity. We want to get the 12%. We are at 11% to this quarter. And we've been making steady progress and if we stay focused on operating leverage and doing the right things for our customers, we know we're going to get there. I would make a point to Brian, what Brian was talking about earlier with about our excess capital. So if you just look at the 11.2% return on tangible come equity we have this quarter. If we were the company at 10% capital instead of 11.5% that would still be above our regulatory minimum we'd have a 50 basis point buffer that would have increased that return on tangible common equity to 12.6%. So we're at our goal right now from an operating standpoint, if we could just continue to make progress on the amount of excess capital we have at the company. In terms of ROE, look we've got a lot of goodwill. We could tomorrow just wear-off all that goodwill. But nothing would change at the company, ROE would just go up to your return on tangible common equity. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And then coming back to the mobile users, I think you guys pointed out you had just shy of 23 million mobile users. What percentage of your customer base are mobile users? And where do you see that number going to in the next two to three years? Brian Moynihan : I say this can't go up because we're starting to - at some inflection point where you've got penetration it continues to go up. So I think we had 30 odd million checking holder. So think about the delta between those two being available for lack of a better term. You've got 34 million digital users. And so you still have some digital on users who don't use the mobile phone just because they do it which means they come through the website instead of an approximately for example. And so each year we think it's not going to - you are starting to hit possible inflection point that goes up 10%, 15% year-over-year. And so I think there's headroom ahead of us. So I think of us to having 30% or more that we could get just easily and we're growing the customer base and we'll drive it. And as you see norms change you'll see that penetration continue to increase. The important thing isn't necessarily only that 22.9 million users. The important thing is how people use it. And so just take the P2P payments even though we do $18 billion this quarter even though it's been a product we've had for a while even though we're going to be launching we'll see how --we'll see how that will drive it. It's still 3%. And even though all the wallets for the SaaP or Samsung or Android or etcetera all those are out there. There's still 1.5% of payments. And so in the end of the day we had a lot of work within the customer base and how they use all the form factors to get more efficient and more effective for them. On top of what you think is more usage more penetration so to speak. So we've got a long way to go on penetration. Only 22% of sales are done. So we'll continue to drive that but importantly for the team Tong and Dean and the team is to drive that usage up and that's where we're starting to see some good pickup but there's a lot of room to go there. Gerard Cassidy : Brian, you mentioned Gazelle. Any early read on what you are seeing there and when do you expect to have a broad launch of that product if you haven't done it already? Brian Moynihan : No, its Zelle not Gazelle. But - I don't want to violate anybody else's trademark here. But sure the - it's still pretty early. The nice thing is that the industry has been a network among all of us that allows us to operate very easily among us of all the companies. And so, I think the better time talking about me in six months or so after we've gotten everybody up and upgrading and driving it through. But previous this we're already driving that was up double digits year-over-year. And so there's sort of just awareness and with the students signing up for accounts from now to the fall, you'll see a lot of embedding this in our marketing and our capabilities. So maybe next quarter we'll have a better. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Q - Matt O : Just a couple of quick follow-ups. Did you guys disclose the debt hedge ineffectiveness drag that was in net interest income this quarter? Connor: Just a couple of quick follow-ups. Did you guys disclose the debt hedge ineffectiveness drag that was in net interest income this quarter? Paul Donofrio : We didn't disclose the amount. It was meaningful, not like huge amount, but it was meaningful. And again, I'd remind everybody that over time is just going to reverse itself. Q - Matt O : Okay. Does that show up in the 10-Q or - I can't remember where we got that from. Connor: Okay. Does that show up in the 10-Q or - I can't remember where we got that from. Paul Donofrio : No. I don't think so. Brian Moynihan : Matt, at the highest level, remembers we ate up. If we go back and think about where we started the quarter, where we ended it, we took out about half of what we thought to increase was going to be due to the card. The rest of us all the factors Paul is talking about ins and outs and chewed up the other half of the projected increase, so give you a sense of dimension. Q - Matt O : Okay. And then just separately the expenses related to the U.K. card business that go away, how much is that? Connor: Okay. And then just separately the expenses related to the U.K. card business that go away, how much is that? Paul Donofrio : Sure. Look, let me just run you through the whole picture, okay. If you want to build any models, but on the revenue side, it's primarily interest income, think about $10 billion of receivables at 9%, plus you got a little small amount of card income I think that was around 30 million in the second quarter. The efficiency ratio for that business is around 40%. If you look in our supplement, you can see I think the net charge-offs ratios it's been running a little bit less than 2% call it $40 million, $45 million per quarter. I think that probably gives you just everything you need to model it. I would remind you that when we sold it, we did get 12 and 15 basis point improvement in our CET ratio on a advanced and standardized perspective respectively. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Steven Chubak with Nomura Instinet. Please go ahead. Steven Chubak : So Brian, I appreciate the helpful commentary you've given on capital ratios and the continued effort to optimize your RWAs. And just given the significant capital cushion that you are operating with today, I'm just wondering how you are thinking about the payout trajectory over the next couple of years. And maybe just to help us frame it from an ROE perspective, because you did note that your excess capital continues to be a drag on returns, what do you believe is a reasonable spot capital target for you to manage to through the cycle? Brian Moynihan : Well, if you take that the 9.5 as the place we're at, we'd have 50 basis points or so of cushion on that at all times and so that gives you a sense where we are, and we're running 11.5 and that difference is available, so you'd expect more. That's assuming that we have 2% growth environment and continue to grow and there's no big recession that comes, we continue to ask for more capital return. I think, keep you focused in the near term. We've got $17 billion-plus that we've got to take out in the next four quarters which is a pretty healthy chunk. And then we'll go through next year CCAR process and you'd expect us like the industry to keep stepping that up to start to work against that excess. Against that, when Paul talked about the last question, the U.K. Card, remember that the thing that people have to think about is not only does it give you current capital benefit, but also - and the stress - the losses and stuff are out of the system so you can also pick that up. So, I'd say, simply point the next 12 months we're going to return more capital we earned in 2016, to give you a framework. And we'd expect to ask for - as we earn more in 2017, we'd expect to ask for more for the next task and keep driving that forward, and everything contributed better asset quality, better earnings, and better modeling and everything else. So our CCAR losses continue to come down, and we continue to drive the responsible growth. So just think about that is a framework to say more in the future. But we've got a nice pick up just coming in the next four quarters. Steven Chubak : Got it. And then just on some of the expense initiatives, Brian, that you outlined. I'm getting quite a few questions on how we should think about it from a timing perspective. I know that you have the $53 billion expense target that's out there, but just given some of the efficiency opportunities that you identified, should we expect that progress to continue beyond 2018? Brian Moynihan : You asked me what have you done for me lately, we're getting to 53 first, Steven, and then we'll move from there. But the idea is that, if you sort of think about an expense base of a financial services firm, and Bank of America in particular, about two-thirds of the cost are people cost, the cost of salaries and wages, incentives, et cetera, health care cost rising at 6%, 7%, 8%, 9% a year and so our job is to figure out how to pay our teammates fairly and more, for more productively and what they do to drive for your shareholders and if you just lock in a growth rate on that just that part of the expense base, you're locking 2% growth. So what we do through all these issues is figure out a way we can turn that into being on a core basis year-over-year sort of flattish. And so what is $53 billion keeps coming down or stays flat or revenue keeps going up both - that will produce further operating leverage. And so we haven't made projections past that 53 more just because we got a lot of initiatives coming in. But you should expect that we will be just as disciplined and thoughtful about how we both invest and invest to take out expense that we've been so far. And I think that are down to our benefit in terms of keeping those expenses relatively flat as revenues grow in the future. Steven Chubak : And just one more quick one for me just on the DoL fiduciary rule. You had outlined your strategy previously for stopping or no longer engaging in retirement brokerage activities. But just given the potential for that rule to be repealed, I'm wondering if your thinking has evolved around that? Brian Moynihan : I'd say let's see what happens. I don't think it will change our thinking. We have accommodated customer's larger balances and some of the areas and some cash IRAs and things that get a little bit different, but just out of necessity. But the overall trend of driving towards the model products and driving towards the effectiveness and offsetting demands for lower and lower cost structure. The customer pays and fees to get higher and higher service and the capabilities from us is what's driving this. The fiduciary rule is only a part of it. And so I don't expect to change our course. Steven Chubak : Thanks for taking my questions Operator : And we'll take our next question from Saul Martinez with UBS. Please go ahead. Saul Martinez : Hi, good morning. First wanted to follow-up on the net interest income. The 100 basis point - the benefit of $3.2 billion you get from a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve, you mentioned it's primarily sensitive to the short end. I think last quarter you gave sort of a 75/25 split between short and long and is that still a good rule of thumb to use? Paul Donofrio : It's changed a little bit. We are a little bit more sensitive on the long-end of interest rates went down, the asset sensitivity in the short-end hasn't changed so much. Saul Martinez : Okay. So a little bit more skewed to the long end than the disclosure in 1Q? Paul Donofrio : It's like two-thirds, one-third. Brian Moynihan : Just look at back up the first half of the year we think about the rate environment it's really changed on the short-end just to give you sense how it works, we've got $1.5 billion, $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion pick up in first half NII versus last year. And so, that gives you a sense. It really is driven 60%, 70% depending on the quarter by the short-end. Paul Donofrio : I think, what's important point, I mean, again we picked up that $1.5 billion, and you haven't seen the sensitivity change much. So that tells you kind of what was embedded in the pass through in the first half of the year. Saul Martinez : Moving on - just to discuss capital deployment strategies a little bit. You've talked about your excess capital position, obviously you upped your returns in the CCAR cycle and you will keep going forward with that. But is it too early to talk about acquisitions as part of the capital strategy? And how would you think about M&A in terms of opportunities whether from a product strategy, geographic segmentation standpoint? How do you think about M&A in the context of your capital strategy? Brian Moynihan : We don't think about M&A in the context of capital strategy. We are organically growing this company, including opening up in markets, investing in bankers, investing in branches, investing in things, and the capability - and investing in cash management capabilities, we built out a lot in Asia. Tom Montag and the team driving our global franchise, we just don't need the distraction. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead. Marty Mosby : Thanks, I've got three bigger picture kind of questions. First, Brian, you've turned the corner on the customer growth and business growth. That was one of my main concerns after so many years of having to deal with the overhang issues to be able to re-energize and get that - business segments growing again. What are the couple of things that you could say have helped go through that inflection point as quick as you've been able to do that? Brian Moynihan : I think, depending on the business, at the end of day if you go across a businesses in the relation of business it's been just deploying more and more relationship management team mates, and being able to pay for that while bringing expenses down across the board. So, that's what this US trust or Merrill Lynch, the preferred business and consumer, the business banking, global commercial bank, of course, investment banking and driving that always had great products. We just literally had to add more sales teams behind that has also been a deployment and technology helped our sales teams. We used an artificial intelligence to prioritize their work in terms of targeting their efforts. And then if you look in both the markets and the markets business separate from the commercial side of it in a true markets business. When you look in the mass market consumer business what we call retail, you see that the nice thing about the retail business the mass market as we are now growing and making money in a business which was a little bit tricky and that's largely because electrification, digitization has been driving it. And if you go to markets the team and equities and fixed income has done a great job to reposition that business and its gaining share. So in each case its investments in people, technology, better customer experience and that all sounds like you say it all the time, but it has been relentless focus and just driving that and investing behind that at all time taking out some extraneous costs including credit costs through very disciplined client selection and credit underwriting capabilities. Marty Mosby : Paul, one of the - sort of the second question to look at, we've talked about the core, core, core and that the Company has taken actions to try to drive that. But really we've had an historical shift in the liquidity premium coming out of the financial crisis and just having rates at zero. So hasn't a lot of this shift been related to just the environment more than really Company actions? And what we are seeing has been the derisking. Now that GWIM deposits are starting to move out, is that the first sign of the rerisking or are the customers willing to take a little bit more risk and drop that liquidity premium? So I'm kind of watching for that first sign of the customer behavior beginning to change. Paul Donofrio : I think Marty across all the years since the crisis there has been ebbs and flows in customers' views about where they want to invest and the cash portion of our balances has come up and down. But I think the consumer and the investor are very bullish on America and they continue investing in consumers through their spending and activity and investors on a personal side through their investments and you've seen those investments in equities and risk products continue to rise almost without fail. And then when there's real market disruption concern you see a pullback a little bit, but basically without fail has been a steady investment and that's why we've had assets under management levels of record levels at this point. Marty Mosby : It just seemed like there's a little bit of a change sitting there. You will see it ripple into some of the other business maybe later. But a third question was with what's going on in the mortgage business, you are retaining 90% of loans. In the past, I don't know the number, but I bet you were securitizing before the financial crisis probably 90% of the loans. How do you look at that business different? That is such a paradigm shift that you really are now a portfolio lender much more than you are a securitization. Are there any other dynamics that we should look at separately? Brian Moynihan : Well, you have to. The business that in pre-crisis that came out of some of the other firms and et cetera was driven by a basic view of generating more and more mortgages as opposed to customers and penetration of customers and giving mortgage to the customers. And so one of the way - the major way it did it 75% of its production was bought from third-parties either its correspondents or brokers or whatever the methodology. All of that's gone. And so, if you had that size of production that was bought in a secondary market through wholesale trades of production, you would have to go off-balance sheet because you wouldn't have the capacity. During the 2004 to 2008, we generate $2 trillion of mortgages or something like that. So you have to go off balance sheet. Now where we're now we're a quarter production runs $13 billion, $15 billion. And this huge deposit franchise that needs to be invested. You can put those mortgages on a balance sheet. The odd thing would be, in the past we were setting them off and then buying back mortgage backed securities, the answer is, we just retain the mortgages and frankly the credit card of ours is not worth paying the insurance. But it really came by focusing on what we call direct-to-consumer where our market share continues to be solid and really saying, we're in this business. It's always been a tough business. It's priced on a commodity basis. It's on your screen every day. And the MSR assets always had interesting issues of how you could hedge them and make them work. Our goal as a company was to take all that volatility and up and down out and just focusing on getting mortgages to start customers of high credit quality. And then why wouldn't we keep them because any other day we've got to invest our deposits somewhere and these are great investments. Paul Donofrio : They're our customers. It's not like we're trying to find somebody else's underwriting. These are our customers. We know these customers. We were over underwriting these loans and while pay the insurance. Marty Mosby : And it's not just you all, I mean it has been across the industry where you are seeing much more in retention than you are seeing in securitization. So I just didn't know if there was any operational or other issues that gives you more flexibility on pricing or product development. It's a very different market than what it used to be when we ran it before. Brian Moynihan : I agree it's a different market and I think a better one because of that. Operator : And we'll take our final question from Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead. Brian Kleinhanzl : I just had a question first on the lending environment overall. Could you give an update of the pipelines? And I know last quarter you said middle market revolver, you were at record levels there. Were you able to increase utilization rates there? Just give a sense of where your clients are if optimism is waning? Paul Donofrio : We feel good about long growth unless the economy changes significantly we wouldn't expect much change from the past quarters. We did see a little bit of dissemination this quarter in commercial that could slow growth in the future. But having said that, we haven't changed our medium term outlook on our ability to grow loans, we expect total long growth for the company to be a low single digit. And we expect to grow mid-single digits in our lines of business. That obviously excludes the headwind from loans and all other mortgage one-off and now U.K. card is gone. So with respect to each segment, we're anticipating modest growth in consumer led by mortgage. We'd also expect to grow a card and auto, although auto growth is probably slowed a little bit but we still expect a little bit growth. That growth is going to be partially offset by continued run off from home equity loans. In commercial, again well, things have slowed a little bit our outlook still remains favorable led by middle market. You saw middle market loans grow 5% year-over-year. And I would note that quarter - growth in any quarter in commercial can bounce around a bit because you've got acquisition, financing thrown into the mix. All of that, I think is consistent with responsible growth. Brian Kleinhanzl : And then just a question on wealth and investment management. You did see the financial advisors increase two percentage points quarter on quarter. Is that a trend now that you think you can - or back into a hiring phase where you can actually grow the number of financial advisors? Because productivity also increased as well. So there was no drag from hiring those advisors. Brian Moynihan : We have a tremendous customer base that is underserved in the investment management area and so we're going to continue to grow our financial advisor team to serve that customer base whether it's the teams that work in the branches, the teams that work in the Merrill office, the team that work in U.S. Trust and we've been after that and growing that. And so you should expect that number to continue to go up with Terry Laughlin, NEC, Keith Banks and team are driving it. And so that's - it's a unit of production for lack of a better term. It's your team that really has the core customer interface and will drive that. Meanwhile, on the non-financial advisor side you saw the assets in edge up 21%. So that means that we're also facing off against the customers, who choose to go about at a different way. Brian Moynihan : All right. I think operator that's all the call. So I want to thank everyone for joining us again this quarter. I think if you think about this quarter it's a quarter which shows you responsible growth it's all about. It's solid earnings growth, very solid operating leverage. Each business grew first half of this year versus first half of last year and did it the right way, did it while maintaining great risk and did it while we invested heavily in technology and invested in our people. So we look forward to next quarter and talk to you soon. Operator : This does conclude today's call. You may disconnect at any time. And have a wonderful day.",

[Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Mr. Lee McEntire. Please go ahead, sir. Lee McEntire : Good morning. Thanks for joining us this morning for our third quarter 2017 results. Hopefully everybody's got a chance to review the earnings release documents that are available on the Bank of America website. Before I turn the call over to Brian and Paul, let me remind you we may make some forward-looking statements and for further information on those, please refer to either our earnings release documents, our website, or our SEC filings. With that, let me turn the call over to Brian Moynihan, our Chairman and CEO for some opening comments before Paul Donofrio, our CFO goes through the details. Over to you Brian. Brian Moynihan : Thank you, Lee. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. This was another strong quarter across the board for Bank of America. Response for growth is delivering for our customers and for you our shareholders with strong operating leverage, strong credit results, and strong expense management. We earned $5.6 billion or diluted EPS of $0.48 per share this quarter that is up 17% from the third quarter of 2016. So thinking back and talking to a lot of you over the last year or so, as we met with you you\u2019ve asked three basic questions. Can Bank of America actually go, whilst sticking to its responsible growth principles? Can we achieve the $53 billion 2018 expense goal? And can you meaningfully invest in the company at the same time you are reducing the cost? So what I thought I would do is use the summary on Page 2 to answer a few of those questions. So on the first question; you can see on Page 2, will responsible growth work? I would point you to several of the metrics there. We\u2019ve been operating under this model for some time. First if you look at this quarter compared to year ago revenue grew 1% on a reported basis. And looking at the core lines of business without other we grew revenue 4% despite the tough comparison of Global Markets. If you move to Global Markets, you can see that the core annuity oriented businesses of Consumer Banking, wealth management and Global Banking grew revenue at 7%. If you look at what drives that revenue growth, average loans and business segments grew 6% year-over-year. Average deposits grew 4% year-over-year, led by our consumer business which grew its deposits 9% year-over-year. The assets under management business reached $1 trillion this quarter and flows into the assets under management were $21 billion in the quarter bringing year-to-date flow to almost $75 billion plus. Our mobile usage continues to grow. We had $1.2 billion mobile interactions this quarter alone, up nearly 20% from last year, it is double than the last three years. Our investment banking fees were up 14% through the nine months this year. And we all did this the right way. With net charge operations still bouncing on decade low as we are growing with our risk framework and driving our strong risk culture. Nonperforming loans at the lowest level since first quarter of 2008 and our market risk remains low. We are growing responsibly. The second question we get asked is, can you get to your expense target? In the second quarter of 2016 we committed to achieving a goal of approximately $53 billion in total expenses by 2018, and that\u2019s all in reported expense. At that time our 12 months leading up to that point was running around $56 billion in expense.  So that means we had to take out $3 billion in cost. This reduction meant we also had to overcome the couple of years of normal merit increases, revenue-based incentive compensation increases, healthcare cost increases, and other inflationary cost such as lease renewals etcetera. And we had to do all this while our volume increased because we were doing more with our customers and have more clients and customers to do business with, and we remain on track. This quarter you can see we reported a little more than $13.1 billion in expenses. Our efficiency ratio moved below 60% on an FTE basis. By the way that is the lowest level expense since the fourth quarter 2008. That was the last quarter before we bought Merrill Lynch. So we reduced the cost in our company equivalent the entire cost structure of Merrill Lynch over those years. Headcount is now down to $210,000 since down again this quarter. So the third question is, can you continue investing in the franchise, while reducing those cost? So the first thing to think about there is for the first nine months of the year we spent nearly $2.25 billion on technology initiatives. That\u2019s on pure initiatives. Look no further than branch in your pocket for evidence of that. Customers using our mobile have increased 47% in the past 12 months. Mobile deposits account of 21% of all check deposit transactions. Digital sales account for 22% of all consumer sales. In this quarter, Zelle came forward, the latest offering we have in mobile area. Bank of America\u2019s volumes alone, our volumes through Zelle this quarter were $4 billion in the third quarter. We processed nearly 14 million transactions and the growth continues. We recently processed $0.5 billion in a single week. Our customers are using Zelle and we look forward to further growth in that area. We\u2019re also continuing to innovate. We\u2019re rolling out auto-shipping across the country, home loans, mobile deployment is following that and as we roll through the next couple of quarters our artificial intelligence offering Erica will come out.  We continue also to invest in our physical network by refurbishing nearly all our existing financial centers, which is well underway and we will complete over the next couple of years. We have been and we will continue to open centers and markets where you have a strong commercial banking wealth management client base that lack financial centers due to historical issues. We continue to enhance our online brokerage offering benefiting consumer and wealth management clients. For our global banking customers we have added the availability of cash pro on our mobile devices. We are using artificial intelligence to efficiently prospect business clients and offer client receivables management alternatives to our clients. We are investing also in an enhanced wholesale of credit underwriting operating model, and in our markets businesses we are redoing the training platforms in total. In addition to the technology investments, we have added 2000 primary sales professionals over the past 12 months, whether relationship bankers, financial advisors, commercial and business leaders. So yes we are doing both, investing and finding ways to be more efficient to pay for, and therefore lowering our overall expense. Now we did all this in an economic environment that still feels very constructive, consistent with growth 2% plus. We expect moderate economic growth to continue this year and we expect the US to grow a little faster next year above 2% and outside of US is growing in the mid-3s. For the year-to-date, interesting in our consumer payments we are seeing consumer activity pickup. Consumers are spending, whether it is checks written, cash taken out of the ATM's, P2P payments, and all the debit and credit cards, 5% more through the first nine months of 2017 than they did in the first nine months of 2016. That\u2019s up faster growth rate than it has been in prior years. Debit and credit card spending were up 7% for the first nine months of the year showing a strong consumer activity. Our commercial clients continue to perform well. They continue to remain optimistic. They continue to look forward to continue implementation of a pro-growth agenda, particularly focused on meaningful tax reform. Housing starts home prices continue to remain on positive trends. Employment is strong and employers continue to search for skilled workers. So that leads to a solid atmosphere and we see no near-term indications of any change to it. As we move to Slide 3, we show that growing responsibly is not new and is showing sustained progress. As you can see on Slide 3, we have delivered positive operating leverage on a year-over-year basis every quarter for the past three years. By the way, not every quarter had revenue growth. And those quarters reduced expenses more than revenue decline. So that remains our focus, continue to drive growth, but on occasions where capital markets might be slower and might be less growth and revenue, we have to manage our expenses well. And we have to do all that while we make to continue to make the investments. That consistent operating leverage shows up in our businesses. All total, we earned $15.7 billion in the first nine months of 2017, up 19% from the first nine months of 2016. On Slide 4 you can see how the businesses contributed those results. The businesses are driving earnings improvement and returns above the firms cost of capital, and they continue to drive their efficiency ratios lower. As you can see global market results are actually down year-over-year for the nine months on a reported basis. Excluding some DVA and prior year recovery, earnings will be up modestly on consistent revenue growth despite low volatility and low activity. But as you look at the other businesses, beginning with the consumer bank, the years of hard work the team has put in is now clearly showing. The business is driving operating leverage as we optimize our delivery network continues to digitize the business and follow the customer's behavior and as it changes over time. In our wealth management business the teams continue to do a good job and you see earnings were up 10% on a year-to-date basis. We have industry-leading margins in the business at 27%, and the leading brands of Merrill Lynch and US trust. And ahead of us we have a lot of work to continue to deal with the industry-wide dynamics and margin pressures. Global Banking had a record-setting $15 billion in revenues year-to-date and has the company's best efficiency ratio as you can see. So as you think about that, all that sums up in allowing us to return more capital to your shareholders. For the first nine months of 2017 we have repurchased $7.9 billion in common shares and paid $2.8 billion in common dividends. This totaled $10.7 billion comparing to $5.6 billion for the same period in 2016. With that, let me turn it over to Paul to give you some other details on the quarter. Paul Donofrio : Okay. Thank you, Brian. I'm starting on Slide 5, as Brian said, we earned $5.6 billion in Q3, up 13% from Q3 2016, EPS of $0.48 per share, up 17% year-over-year as we reduced dilutive shares by 3% over the past 12 months. Revenue of $21.8 billion was 1% higher than Q3 2016 as NII improvement and higher asset management fees outpaced decline in sales and trading, and mortgage banking income. Expenses of $13.1 billion were 3% lower than Q3 2016. We generated more than 3% of operating leverage. The efficiency ratio of 60% for the second consecutive quarter now 59% on an FTE basis. Provision expense was $834 million, down modestly, compared to Q3 2016 and we see continued improvement in consumer real estate and energy. Return on assets this quarter was 98 basis points and return on tangible common equity was 11.3%, improving both on a year-over-year and a linked quarter basis. Turning to the balance sheet on Slide 6, overall compared to June 30, end of period assets increased $29 billion, driven by strong deposit growth that funded an increase in loans to customers with the remainder invested in securities and cash. Loans on an end of period basis were up $10.5 billion from Q2 led by commercial activity, while consumer loan growth was mitigated by the continued run-off of legacy non-core loans. On the liability side, long term debt increased $4.7 billion during the quarter as we took advantage of favorable credit spreads to pre-fund upcoming maturities. Given that we are now compliant with TLAC requirements our debt issuance over the next few quarters will likely be more opportunistic. Liquidity remains strong with 517 billion in global liquidity sources and our liquidity coverage ratio was 126%.Common equity increased more than $4 billion compared to Q2. During the quarter, Berkshire Hathaway converted its Series T preferred stock into 700 million shares of common stock for the terms of their 2011 investment. As a result of this conversion common equity increased and preferred stock decreased by the 2.9 billion book value of their Series T preferred stock. This issuance does not impact diluted EPS in this or subsequent quarters as the effect of this conversion was already accounted for in diluted EPS. The remaining increase in common equity reflects $5.1 billion in net income available to common, partially offset by the return of capital totaling $4.2 billion through both common dividends and share repurchases. Tangible book value per share of $17.23 was modestly higher than Q3 2016, but decreased 3% versus Q2 2017 as a result of the Series T conversion.  Turning to regulatory metrics and focusing on the advanced approach. Our CET1 transition ratio on the Basel III ended the quarter at 11.9%. On a fully phased-in basis compared to Q2, the CET1 ratio improved 40 basis points to 11.9% that remains well above our 2019 requirement of 9.5%. CET1 increased $4.9 billion to $173.6 billion, driven by earnings and the Berkshire Hathaway conversion. The CET1 ratio also benefited from a modest $3 billion decline in RWA as growth in loans and low RWA density assets was offset by continuing optimization of the balance sheet. We also provide our capital metrics under the standardized approach RWA increased $15 billion from Q2, driven by loan growth, but increases in capital more than offset asset growth resulting in a CET1 ratio improvement of 20 basis points to 12.2%.Supplementary leverage ratios for both the parent and bank continued to exceed US regulatory minimums that don't take effect until 2018. Turning to Slide 7, on an average basis total loans increased to $918 billion, note that the sale of UK card, which was recorded in All Other impacted year-over-year comparison of average loans by $9.3 billion. Adjusting for the sale, average loans were up $26.8 billion or 3% year-over-year. Loan growth continue to be dampened by the run-off of non-core consumer real estate loans and All Other, year-over-year loans in All Other including the sale of UK card were down 28 billion. On the other hand loans in our business segments were up 47 billion or 6%. Consumer banking and wealth management both experienced solid loan growth of 8%. Both businesses continue to see good growth in residential mortgages. Consumer banking also saw growth in credit card and vehicle loans, originations of new home equity loans was solid, but overall loan growth continues to be outpaced by pay downs. In wealth management, growth was also aided by structured lending. Global banking loans were up 4% year-over-year led by CNI growth in the US and abroad. On the bottom right, note that we grew average deposits by $45 billion or nearly 4% year-over-year. This growth was driven by consumer segments, deposits increasing by $53 billion or nearly 9% year-over-year. Average deposits declined year-over-year in our wealth management segment as clients sought alternatives for their cash within brokerage or AUM. Deposit outflows here largely abated in Q3 and ending deposits were slightly up from the end of Q2. Deposits in global banking experienced strong growth in Q3, driven by rate actions taken in the quarter to win and defend relationship deposits. Turning to asset quality on Slide 8, credit quality continues to be solid with net charge-offs, NPLs and reservable criticized exposure all showing improvement from Q2. Total net charge-offs were 900 million or 39 basis points of average loans decreasing modestly from Q2. Provision expense of 834 million included 66 million net reserve releases. Provision expense was in-line with the prior year, but increased $108 million from Q2 as a result of less net reserve releases. Our reserve coverage remained strong with an allowance to loan ratio of 116 basis points and a coverage level three times our annual charge-offs. On Slide 9, we break out credit quality metrics for both our consumer and commercial portfolios. With respect to consumer net charge-offs were down from Q2, included in the quarter were recoveries on the sale of some consumer real estate loans, partially offsetting this recovery benefit was the negative impact of clarifying guidance from the regulators on bankruptcies, which increased our consumer losses this quarter. The net effect of all these pluses and minuses was minimal. Consumer NPLs of $5.3 billion were the lowest they have been since Q2 2008. NPLs came down from Q2 levels and keep in mind 45% of our consumer NPLs are current on their payments. Commercial losses were up modestly from Q2, driven by a couple of names, while reservable criticized exposures and NPLs declined. With respect to the impact of hurricanes, first let me say that our focus has been on those impacted by the storms, including our employees and customers. One decision we made early was to provide a payment deferral to many of our customers in the impacted areas, delaying some potential net charge-offs in Q3. Since then we have and we will continue to engage with consumers and businesses in the impacted areas to better understand how we can assist them. As it relates to credit, we have not seen any material impact. Our overall net reserve release for the quarter did include a modest build related to the storms for losses that are probable and it goes without saying that we believe we are adequately reserved today. Turning to Slide 10, net interest income on a GAAP non-FTE basis was $11.2 billion, $11.4 billion on an FTE basis. Compared to Q3 2016, which has the same day count and seasonal factors, NII is up 960 million or more than 9% driven by an improving spread between our asset yields and deposit pricing. The year-over-year comparison also benefited from loan growth and excess deposits deployed in security balances. An additional benefit was higher long-end rates from Q3 2016, which drove lower prepayments and therefore lower bond premium write-offs. The full quarter effect of the sale of UK card negatively impacted the comparison focusing on net interest yield it improved 18 basis points from Q3 2016 to 2.36% after adjusting for the impact of UK card. Compared to Q2 2017 NII increased 175 million as the benefits from an increase in short-end rates and an extra day of interest, as well as loan and deposit growth was mitigated by a number of factors. First, we lost the two months of interest income associated with the UK card book. Second, we raised rates broadly across our wealth management business to offer clients a competitive deposit alternative to cash alternatives within brokerage and AUM. Third, we experienced a decline in long-end rates in Q2 and early in Q3, which impacted reinvestment rates, as well as increase the write-off of bond premium as mortgage prepayment speeds accelerated. I would note that we also increased deposit pricing for some commercial clients, which had a modest impact on NII in the quarter. Looking ahead to Q4, assuming no changes in interest rates, NII growth will be dependent on loan and deposit growth and pricing. If we get a late 4Q hike, as expected by the market, this should mostly benefit NII in Q1 2018. With respect to asset sensitivity as of 930 [ph] an instantaneous 100 basis point parallel increase in rates is estimated to increase NII by 3.2 billion over the subsequent 12 months. This is largely unchanged from June 30 and continues to be predominantly driven by our sensitivity to short-end rates. Turning to Slide 11, our teams continued to deliver on cost management. Net interest expense of $13.1 billion is down more than $300 million or 3% from Q3 2016. Productivity improvements were driven by our focus on digitizing processes and lowering our cost to deliver for our customers. Keep in mind that we are seeing these expense declines while investment in technology and new sales professionals remains robust. Compared to Q3 2016, in addition to overall operating cost improvements we reduced personnel expense, which included costs associated with our UK card business, as well as non-personal expense, which included lower litigation expenses. Compared to Q2 2017, expenses declined by $600 million with half of that decline driven by, Q2 2017 charge in anticipation of the sale of several data centers. Q3 also included modest declines from lower severance, as well as revenue related incentives. The remaining reduction reflects broad-based improvement as we drive operational excellence. The efficiency ratio hit our 60% target again this quarter. With respect to headcount, we are down from the prior quarter and continue to see a shift from non-client facing associates to primary sales professionals, which now make up more than 21% of our headcount. We have added more than 2000 primary sales professionals over the past 12 months. Okay. Turning to the business segments and starting with consumer banking on Slide 12, earnings were $2.1 billion growing 15% year-over-year and returning 22% on allocated capital. The business created over 800 basis points of operating leverage on revenue growth of 10%, which outpaced expense growth of 2%. Year-over-year average loans grew 8%, average deposits grew 9%, and Merrill Edge brokerage assets grew 21%. Revenue growth was led by NII, driven by increases in client balances. Revenue was modestly impacted this quarter by the Hurricanes as we took steps to help customers in the impacted areas. We expect the dip in fees and interchange weakness to be temporary as impacted communities begin to recover and rebuild. With respect to expenses, through continued efforts to drive operating leverage the efficiency ratio improved over 400 basis points to 51%. Cost of deposits and rate paid, which when combined represents cost of goods sold from a deposit perspective remain steady at a combined rate of 160 [ph] basis points in the quarter. Consumer banking credit quality reflected moderate seasoning and portfolio growth, which drove reserve build of 168 million in addition to the 800 million in net charge-offs. The net charge-off ratio declined modestly from Q2 to 1.18% of loans. Turning to Slide 13 and looking at key trends, as I said earlier, revenue increased 10% year-over-year. Within revenue, mortgage banking income was the only major category that was lower year-over-year, driven by our strategy of holding more originations on balance sheet instead of selling to the agencies, as we like the economics of holding these high quality originations. In Q3, we retained about 80% of first mortgage production on balance sheet.  Looking at revenue more broadly, we believe our relationship deepening prefers reward program is improving NII and balance growth, while mitigating industry pressures on fees as we reward customers for doing more business with us. This is why we continue to emphasize total revenue as opposed to fees and NII separately. Having said that spending levels on debit and credit cards were up 7% year-over-year and new issuance of credit cards were solid at $1.3 million. Spending levels on cards drove revenue increases, but were again largely offset by the rewards to customers. We saw modest year-over-year improvement in card fees, as well as service charges. Focusing on client balances on the bottom left you can see the success we continue to have growing deposits, loans, and brokerage assets. With respect to loans, residential mortgage continued to lead our growth, but we also saw good growth in auto, as well as better growth in card than we\u2019ve experienced in quite some time. We remain focused on prime and super volume borrowers with average booked FICO Scores of at least 760. Client brokerage assets were up 21% year-over-year, driven by strong client flows, as well as market performance. Net new accounts grew 6% from Q3 2016. At the bottom right, you can see deposits broken out. Our 9% year-over-year average deposit growth continued to outpace the industry, while the rate paid remained low and stable. Importantly, 50% of these deposits are check-in accounts and we estimate that 90% of these check-in accounts are the primary accounts of households. Expenses were up modestly compared to Q3 2016 despite strong revenue growth as optimization and digitalization savings were more than offset by investments and refurbishing branches and technology initiatives. Turning to Slide 14, let\u2019s look again this quarter at digital banking highlights as they continue to shape the way we do business with our customers. As you can see, the year-over-year growth in these metrics is impressive. We remain the leader in digital banking. We now have nearly 24 million mobile users and another 11 million online with us. Within the 639 billion and in total payments shown here note how digital continues to grow as customers move away from cash and check. This migration is helping us lower expenses and reduce operational risk. Further, digital growth of credit and debit card usage is accelerating as ecommerce grows and more payments are taking place within merchant applications like Uber and Starbucks. Within total payments, it is person-to-person and I want to spend a moment on Zelle as Bank of America has been one of the lead banks introducing this P2P capability for customers. Note the steady adoption by Bank of America customers of this online app, which makes it easier to spend, request, and even split person-to-person money transfers. Also note on the bottom left the growth in mobile channel usage, this quarter we saw nearly 1.2 billion logins, which is up 19% versus Q3 2016 and more than 21% of all check deposit transactions are now done on mobile devices. This represents the volume of 1,100 financial centers and while important in terms of how we transact with customers, mobile has also become important in terms of how we connect with our customers. One example of that is the reduction in our call centre volumes, which are down 13% over the past three years, and we continue to innovate. This quarter we rolled out an app in several states for mobile auto shopping, which will soon be followed by a mortgage shopping and fulfillment app - mobile auto shopping, which will soon be followed by a mortgage shopping and fulfillment app. That we call home loans navigator. Still, even with all this digital activity it is important to note that we still have 775,000 people a day walking into our financial centers across the US. Many of these customers still use our centers to transact, but many use the centers as financial destinations where they can learn more about products and services, work face-to-face with the specialized professional and generally improve their financial lives. That\u2019s why we continue our multi-year branch refurbishment program, and it is also why we continue to add new financial centers in markets where we have never had a Bank of America Center, but we have a strong presence in other lines of business. This quarter for example, we opened centers in Denver, Minneapolis, and Indianapolis. In addition, we are testing the advanced centers, which utilize video assist ATMs and other video conferencing capabilities in areas where it makes sense to do that. Turning to Slide 15, let\u2019s review Global Wealth and Investment Management. We had produced earnings of 769 million, up 10% in Q3 2016, a pre-tax profit margin of 27% and a return on allocated capital of 22%. The market and client activity once again provided a tailwind for asset management fees, while at the same time transaction revenue continues to face headwinds as the industry evolves and adapts new fiduciary requirements, and the increasing adoption of passive investing. In All, revenue grew 6% year-over-year led by NII and a 13% increase in asset management fees, partially offset by lower transactional revenue. We saw nearly 21 billion of AUM flows this quarter continuing the strength of 57 billion in the first half of the year. Year-over-year expenses were up 4%, driven by revenue related incentives, other expenses were managed well creating modest operating leverage in this segment. Moving to Slide 16, we continue to see overall solid client engagement, capital balances rose to nearly 2.7 trillion, driven by higher market values, solid AUM flows and continued loan growth. Average deposits $240 billion were down $5 billion from Q2. The increase in deposit rates at the end of the second quarter helped to mitigate the movement of client balances from deposits to other cash investment alternatives within AUM and brokerage.  The decline in NII from Q2 to Q3 reflects the cost of this rate increase. Average loans of $154 billion grew 8% year-over-year and reflect the continued trend of investment clients deepening their relationship with us. Loan growth remained concentrated in consumer real estate, as well as structured lending. Okay. Turning to Slide 17, Global Banking earned 1.8 billion. This was a 13% increase from Q3 2016. Return on allocated capital was 17% and stable with last year, despite $3 billion increase in allocated capital. Year-over-year revenue growth of 5% was driven by improved NII reflecting solid loan and deposit growth, compounded by rising short-term interest rates.  We also grew IBCs modestly year-over-year led by debt and advisory fees. Revenue improvement coupled with lower expenses created operating leverage of 650 basis points and an efficiency ratio of 43%. This expense comparison versus Q3 2016 reflects savings offset by continued technology investment. We also added new bankers, while keeping overall headcount relatively flat over the year. We\u2019re also deploying more AI capabilities in this business. The focus so far has been on improving client prospecting and more intelligent receivable processing for clients. Provision expense of $48 million remains low and is down from Q3 2016 on improvements across most of the portfolio, particularly energy. Global Banking grew loans 4% year-over-year. As Brian mentioned, our loan growth in global banking has been pretty consistent over the past three or four quarters at 4% to 6% on a year-over-year basis. When compared to Q2, I would note an increase in loans near the end of the quarter drove end of period balances meaningfully above the average. Looking at the trends on Slide 18 and comparing to Q3 last year, average loans of 346 billion were up nearly 12 billion. With the exception of CRE loan growth was fairly broad based with slightly elevated growth in Asia. Loan spreads were stable compared to Q2 2017, but compressed compared to the year ago period. Average deposits rose [ph] 3% compared to Q3 2016 with most of it concentrated in Q3 given the rate action this quarter. Total investment banking fees of $1.5 billion were up modestly from a strong Q3 2016. Debt underwriting remained strong, while equity underwriting was down from a year ago, growth and advisory fees also benefited the year-over-year comparison. Year-to-date we remain ranked number three in investment banking fees with fees up 4.6 billion, which is up 14% from 2016. Switching to Global Markets on Slide 19, the business had a solid quarter although it is a tough comparison against a strong Q3 2016 for the reasons you all know. Global Markets generated $3.9 billion in revenue and earned $770 million after adjusting for a modest impact from DVA. Given that some tough comparison, we view this quarter as solid, despite the fact that sales and trading revenue of 3.2 billion, excluding DVA declined 15% from Q3 2016.  Excluding net DVA and versus Q3 2016 fixed sales and trading of 2.2 billion decreased 22% within fixed the decrease was driven by less favorable market conditions across credit products, especially mortgages combined with lower volatility in rates, products in the current quarter. Equity sales and trading was up 2% year-over-year to a little less than a billion benefiting from growth in client financing activity, lower volatility also drove lower secondary market activity in equities. With respect to expenses, Q3 2017 was 2% higher than Q3 2016, driven by increased technology investment in our trading platform, as well as numerous regulatory requirements such as Mifid2, Volcker, and UMR among others. Moving to trends in Slide 20 and focusing our attention or your attention on the components of our sales and trading performance on a year-to-date basis for just a moment. While the quarter is down from Q3 2016 as you can see on the lower left box, sales and trading revenue has been fairly consistent on a year-to-date basis for the last three years at roughly $10.5 billion. And note that we have achieved the stability while reducing VAR and RWA. And just as important, if not more important, this revenue consistency reflects the value to our clients of our diverse product set and sales and trading capabilities in every major market across the globe. Without this strength in diversity, one would have seen a lot more revenue volatility as client activity shifted from a product and market perspective over the last three years. On Slide 21 we show All Other, which reported a net profit of $217 million. This is an improvement of roughly 400 million, compared to Q3 2016. This quarter included lower litigation expense, while reps and warranty expense increased a little more than 100 million over Q3 2016. Reps and warranty provision is recorded as contra revenue in mortgage banking income and with the result of advanced negotiations with certain counterparties to resolve several outstanding legacy issues. Also note that mortgage banking income in Q3 2016 included a benefit of roughly $300 million and net MSR hedge results. And also remember that this is the first quarter without the UK card business, which was sold in June. So, in addition to two months of approximately 250 million in normal quality revenue generated from UK card, Q2 also included a 795 million benefit from the sale of UK card that was mostly offset by tax expense in that quarter. And when making expense comparisons remember, in addition to lower litigation Q2 also included a 295 million impairment charge on three datacenters that we are in the process of selling. Lastly, note that the effects of tax rate for the quarter was 29%. Okay. Just a few summary points to wrap-up. Again this quarter, we created positive operating leverage by growing revenue, while lowering expenses. And as Brian pointed out, this continued a trend of many quarters of positive operating leverage. For years we have been focused on growing responsibly, while improving operating efficiency and making our growth more sustainable. And importantly, we have stuck to and not compromised our client and risk frameworks while doing so. NII growth is benefiting from the value of our deposit franchise and continued loan growth and a modestly improving world economy. Asset quality remained strong as net charge-offs, NPLs, and commercial reserve-like criticized exposure all declined. We continue to invest in new technologies and capabilities, while adding sales professionals in certain businesses and we did all this on nearly doubling the amount of capital we returned to shareholders this year versus last year. This tells us that responsible growth is working and that we are well positioned to continue to invest in and grow with our customers and clients as the economy continues to improve. Thank you, and with that we will open it up to questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will go first to the line of Nancy Bush with NAB Research. Please go ahead. Nancy Bush : Good morning. Brian I have a question on digital banking, I guess right after the crash when you guys sort of first began to emphasize digital and mobile banking, you were sort of the leader in the industry in that regard and do you still feel that you have that leadership position, is it important that you keep it and what are your thoughts about what you need to do to do that? Brian Moynihan : I think we have leadership position if that\u2019s told just by other people and how they rate people in terms of activities and capabilities and things like that, but most importantly it\u2019s how your customers use you, and what you see going on. So, if you look at the Page 14 that Paul took you through, you can see the growth in transactions and trends in activity, and while you mentioned that the drive after the crisis, but the reality is the drive started before the crisis, and we were one of the first apps available on Smartphones way back to the start of the iPhone, and so that helped us grow quickly, but it is a core platform for us. The question is, how do we drive all its feature functionality? The deposits that go through on a daily basis or equivalent of thousand branch activity and deposits to give you examples so its smooth major amounts of activity. We are excited about the Zelle payment levels because at the end of the day we have $5 billion that we spend a year on the cash currency, checks moving around our company and the system that the way we are going to get there is by coming, you know digitizing those and eliminating cash and driving that, and so things like Zelle, whether small numbers compared to all the other payment forms today the pace that they are growing at with the digital wallets and other things will help drive it there So, we feel we are a leader. We expect to be a leader. The activity grows faster, and I think you put it against any kind of mobile digital person out there, 1.2 [ph] billion customer interactions in the quarter shows you that people believe that it must be pretty good. Nancy Bush : Is there a direct relationship or is there any kind of quantification that you\u2019ve done or \u2018x\u2019 mobile transactions means why fewer branches, is there that direct a relationship? Brian Moynihan : Yes and no. Yes in the sense that we know the cost of the various things, you know a branch transaction for deposits is 10 times more than a mobile transaction, but remember at the same time we\u2019re investing heavily in the high touch side of our house. 2000 more salespeople, a lot of those in consumer, refurbishing all the branches, building out branches, and things like that because at the end of the day 20% odd of sales were on digital and mobile, but 80% aren\u2019t and because of the nature of the intimate customer discussions because of the nature of what customers want to discuss and have face-to-face help on the branches are critically important to that.  So the real question is, you have to have both be successful. The model doesn't works, it solely one or the other in the mode of having both works and that\u2019s where you can see the activity growth. Think about the deposit growth year-over-year and consumer of 50 odd billion dollars and start to think about that in the context of activity. Nancy Bush : Okay. And just one quick follow-up for Paul, Paul you mentioned in global banking that all categories of loans grew except CRE, is that a self selection or could you just expand on that a bit? Paul Donofrio : Yes, sure. We instituted - a year ago now, it is not longer, we pulled back a little bit on CRE, so we are still servicing customers there, we are still making loans, but we\u2019re not, we're just being a little bit more cautious, and so you're not seeing a lot of growth in our CRE balances. And I would point out that, that kind of makes a 4% growth all that more kind of interesting, given our stance there. Nancy Bush : Okay. All right. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll go next to the line of Glenn Schorr from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Glenn Schorr : Hi, thanks. Brian Moynihan : Good morning, Glenn. Glenn Schorr : Good morning. Little drilling down on your comments on deposit costs rise. So we go from, I guess, 8 basis points last year to 24 basis points this, or 11 basis points to 24 basis points over the last quarter. How much of that increase is what you mentioned in Wealth Management? I heard your comment on the - bringing them a competitive cash alternative. I\u2019m just curious, is it CD versus money market? Is it all coming from current clients? Thanks. Paul Donofrio : Mostly in Wealth Management and it\u2019s - I wouldn't say, it's in one place or another, it's kind of across a lot of the different deposit products we offer to that community of investors and depositors. Brian Moynihan : Glenn, if you go to Page 10 of the supplement package, you can see the comparison of the third quarter last year to this year, and I start to think about some of the numbers you were citing. But if you look at the different categories, you're going to see that most of the move is in the now Money Market, which is - that's where the Wealth Management business is, and then the $240 billion odd number in there, about $140 billion of it is really people\u2019s invested cash. And so if we make an allocation like we did in the second quarter to less cash and more equities that actually brings deposits out and then people are obviously thinking as investment cash. These are accounts that might have $5 million in securities in it and $500,000 of cash. So, obviously, the rate structure moves in that. But if you think about it across a year, there's about a 75 basis point increase in Fed funds, and you start to put these numbers against and even Wealth Management is relatively modest in terms of the change in the overall. The other thing that drives our profitability is, if you look at that page go down and you remember that\u2019s non-interest bearing account, the deposits are still zero, and they grew - they\u2019re $436 billion of non-interest bearing accounts. If you look in the consumer side there, that drives the profitability and that's where it comes from. Glenn Schorr : Gotcha. So there\u2019s - a competitor too had put out some high price or high rate CDs in an effort to gather new client money that this is more of just compensating clients for being good clients sharing a little bit of the level? Brian Moynihan : Yes,. I would not say we\u2019re - CDs are down $4 billion at Bank of America year-over-year. Glenn Schorr : I appreciate that. Paul Donofrio : This is about providing our GWIM clients with an alternative - a deposit alternative, if they want to take it. Since they have options in AUM and brokerage for some other excess cash. Glenn Schorr : Okay, cool. And I'm just curious to follow-up on the comment you guys have in the slides on targeted growth in client financing activities and equities. Is that just growing PB with the clients? Paul Donofrio : We talked about that last quarter where we made a decision to add some balance sheet to our equities business. We see an opportunity there. We've made a lot of investments in technology. We've got great relationships, and there's an opportunity to add a little bit more leverage to that business. So we provided some balance sheet, so we did that last quarter and we continue to do that this quarter, and it's having an effect. Like you said, it's PB, but it's also synthetic PB in Europe, so it's both synthetic and physical. Glenn Schorr : All right. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll go next to the line of John McDonald with Bernstein. Please go ahead. John McDonald : Hi, good morning. I want to ask about expenses, the magnitude of the improvement was nice - surprise this quarter. I think you were targeting kind of $100 million year-over-year improvement and you\u2019ve got something closer to $300 million or more. Just wondering where did you kind of outperform your own expectations on expenses this quarter? And is this run rate, I mean, ballpark kind of a good jumping off point, Paul? Paul Donofrio : Yes, I would say, we feel great about the work we did. We've always talked about expenses not being a straight line, the same line every quarter. This quarter, we did maybe a little better than other quarters. You're right it was down about $300 million year-over-year, and those expense reductions were broad-based across personnel and non-personnel. John McDonald : And in terms of next year when you think about the $53 billion target doesn't look like you might need it. But do you have any expectations that the roll off of the FDIC Special Assessment kind of help you get to that target and just maybe a reminder of how much that expense stepped up for you? Paul Donofrio : Yes. Look, we - it\u2019s a good question. We - I think the industry was assuming that that would end in the second quarter. It looks like it may extend to the third quarter, because we're not going to get to the level they need to get to. So that actually hurts us. And that's why we always say, we're going to get to approximately $53 billion for full-year 2018. There\u2019s a lot of things could happen. I don't know the exact amount. Is it roughly $100 million quarterly? Brian Moynihan : Yes. Paul Donofrio : It\u2019s around $100 million quarterly. So it's a material number. John McDonald : Okay. Paul Donofrio : I think it\u2019s a little more than $100 million, frankly, but I can get back to you on that. John McDonald : Okay. And then I guess just on capital return, Brian, with that CET1 growing nicely, anything that you could see now that would stop you from approaching more of a peer capital payout next year? And then can you just remind us what kind of CET1 ratio would be a good target for you in knowing what you know now about regulatory minimums? Brian Moynihan : A couple of things. One, we would expect to keep moving up the ladder in terms of capital management this year 88% [ph] I think is a number and you expect us to keep pushing forward. And to - on the levels where 9.5, you\u2019d add 50, 75 basis points on top of that, the SIFI buffer levels can bounce around on you. But you think about somewhere around 10 to 10.5, and if you subtract that from the 12, that's a pretty good amount of excess capital. John McDonald : Okay. And just one quick follow-up Paul on that FDIC expense roll off. That's in the numbers now. You\u2019re kind of running close to almost 13 per quarter, it's almost at 53 annualized. You're just saying that if you didn't get that step down, it gets a little tougher to get to the target? Paul Donofrio : Yes, I'm just -look, we've - the target now goes back to the middle of 2016. We said at that time, we would achieve approximately $53 billion for full-year 2018. So, obviously, if - it's a little harder if FDIC doesn\u2019t roll off in the second quarter and extends in the third quarter, but we're going to get there either way. John McDonald : Gotcha. Okay, fair enough. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll go next to the line of Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good morning. Brian Moynihan : Good morning, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : A couple of questions. One, as we go towards the $53 billion, can you just give us a sense as to the source of the improvement consumer versus corporate? Brian Moynihan : Betsy, I think, if you look at the quarterly progression across all expense categories, it comes from everywhere. And so, comes from the data center configurations that we took a charge and moved a lot of stuff last quarter. It comes from continuing to shed real estate occupancy cost, it comes from lower headcount that was down of 1,000 this quarter. It comes from taking out expense and layers for things we called organizational health. But if you think of it more strategically, it comes from basically applying technology and digitizing processes. And so across the - with our wholesale banking and credit underwriting initiatives I talked about, we\u2019ve been able to save about 20% of the headcount there by consolidating our activities and bringing their activities together. We will have another big chunk as we go to apply the technology that we are developing that is not yet deployed. And so it's a thousand ideas. It's little, I mean, thousands of ideas. It's literally across the Board, and the team does a great job of just going after piece by piece by piece. And then we can manage the, sort of repositioning cost by getting ahead of it and doing it on a rational basis. So that attrition - we\u2019ll hire 8,000 people this quarter to maintain headcount sort of neutral or down a bit. So we have a lot of chances not to hire people and continue to shrink the company when we apply this technology. Betsy Graseck : I'm just thinking about the digital efforts, obviously, you\u2019ve put a lot of time in the call on the\u2026 Brian Moynihan : Yes. Betsy Graseck : \u2026consumer side, just wondering rate of change on corporate is that where you think the digital efforts are picking up? Brian Moynihan : Yes, there'll be more there because of like trade finance. We\u2019d start digitizing more processes. And if those processes prove out, we\u2019ll drive it. There's a lot in the back office of the securities clearance capabilities that is going on. So there are - the numbers are - the consumer always dominates in terms of numbers in a lot of ways just if you think about it. But GWIM has a bunch of digitization efforts, a bunch that saves statements and we set up 12 statements, if we get people to take e-statements that saves 12 times a year times whatever it cost for that particular statement. So these things are never - if there\u2019s something - if there\u2019s some silver bullet, you could shoot and take care of it all at once, we would have shot it already, this is just hard work. Betsy Graseck : So then, the follow-up is, question I get from people all the time, which is, we get the expense improvements? Are there any fee pressures that we should also be baking in here when you talk about cash management, fee rate, some of the Fintech disrupters look at these peoples and say, oh, this is too high, I'm going to go after that, I'm assuming that you're staying ahead of that thread. I'm just wondering, is there a fee rate that we should be making sure that we're including when we give you the expense side? Brian Moynihan : Yes, I mean, I think we've given the guidance on the expense side. If you think about something like another global transaction service platform cash management, as people call it, there has always been this loss and revenue that you're fighting against when paper - which people pay us more to process turns to digital, we lose revenue, but we save expense at a faster rate. That has been going through the numbers over the last several years. So the revenue growth we see in cash management takes that all into account. So it\u2019s more customers, more activity fighting off, whether customers are converting cash to digital. So, yes, that's a part of it, but you're seeing in our run rate. There's nothing sort of ahead of us, it\u2019s unusual compared to the quarter-to-quarter sort of picking away at us that goes on in that regard. Betsy Graseck : And then consumer expense ratio 51% that - as you're getting more people onto your Zelle platform, et cetera, is there a line of sight to that going sub-50 at some point? Brian Moynihan : I think through both the revenue lift they get, as the rate structure rises and good expense management, we\u2019d expect that it should move down below 50 at some point. But we never say to people where do we think you can get to some big target, or the consumer team has set some targets. I said don't give people targets, because I don\u2019t think that that\u2019s success. We don't know where it goes. In other words, over - I\u2019m not talking about next quarter, but over multiple years, when you continue to drive the revenue expense play here, because the 2 million of core transaction deposit account and getting it from $2,000 over the last 8, 10 years to $6,000 per account is a tremendous revenue lift by focusing primary accounts as the number of accounts actually fell by 10%. And so that dynamic is what we're after. So, yes, it'll move down, but I wouldn't - we never put that success, because then people will quit working. Betsy Graseck : Got it. Thanks, Brian. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll go next to the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Mike Mayo : Hi. Brian Moynihan : Good morning, Mike. Mike Mayo : Yes, your branch account continues to go down, I guess, down 3% year-over-year, but deposits are up 4% year-over-year. And I'm trying to get a distinction between retention of deposits for your closed branches, retention of customers, because according to your 10-K from 2015 to 2016, the number of accounts declined by about 2%. But at the same time, deposits continue to grow just like the entire decade. So my question is, what is your retention rate of deposits, and what is your retention rate of customers when you close a branch today and why the difference? Brian Moynihan : The deposits to consumer just, Mike, which are more and small business, which are more related to your thing, we\u2019re actually up 9% year-over-year, not 4%, that's the overall incorporate level, including GWIM commercial. But if you look at across time, it really depends on where you're closing a branch obviously and what's nearby, but the retention rates continue to go up. The - over time, because the physical plan becomes less dominant in the relevance to the customer. And so what we\u2019re doing is fine tuning the branch account and often consolidating into a bigger branch that we've invested heavily into the quality of the branch itself, but the numbers of people there. So our branches are getting bigger in terms of numbers of people in them and smaller in terms of account. When you think about the customer falloff in terms of number of accounts was really continuing to focus on our primary account. So as we do that, the balances are up twice in the accounts, I think, over the last seven years or something like that and account numbers are down from 34 million to 31 million, that was all driven by our view that we had to get to the primary account, because that's where the profit could be made in the core transaction capabilities there. So we closed a lot of people, people ran off who were using us as a secondary or third bank just because they loved our distribution of ATMs and things like that and basically we have emphasized primary account sales. Mike Mayo : I'm not sure if you disclosed this. So what is the retention of deposits when you close a branch today and what was it\u2026? Brian Moynihan : We don't disclose it. We don\u2019t disclose it separately, Mike, that\u2019s all in there. So, in that 9% growth is everything we did, so\u2026 Mike Mayo : Okay. And just the last question. You mentioned, I mean, digital banking is up, mobile banking is up, you mentioned 1,100 branches that\u2019s equivalent of it, that\u2019s good. So have you reached a specific point where you can go from 4,500 branches down to 3,500 branches or 4,000, how far can you go? Brian Moynihan : That always depend on the customer behavior and other factors. We are deploying new branches, hundreds of them over a multi-year period in the places we didn't have branches before located more strategically given circa 2017 beyond banking. So we don't put a - again, it's not another number, we target a number. What we target is a more and more efficient system. And so, each day three quarters of a million people come into our branches and our teammates serve them well and our scores of those branches are all-times high in terms of satisfaction, and 80% of the sales go on in that space. So, I wouldn't want to cut them back at one branch more than the customer wants us to do it by - evidenced by the behavior. Mike Mayo : All right. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll go next to the line of Steven Chubak Nomura Instinet. Please go ahead. Steven Chubak : Thanks. Good morning. I had a follow-up question regarding the discussion earlier about GWIM deposit competition and just some of the efforts that you cited to compete with other cash alternatives. I was hoping you could quantify the actual magnitude of deposit price increase that we saw in the quarter? And maybe just give a little bit more context as to what prompted the action? And, Paul, I know you gave some color here. I'm just trying to get a better understanding as to whether this is really driven by increased competitive pressures, or is it more a function of the DOL, which actually requires that some clients receive reasonable compensation on some of their assets, including cash? Paul Donofrio : I don't think - it's not a function of the DOL, it's a function of our desire to give our customers an alternative to leave their money in a deposit account at Bank of America as opposed to seeking other alternatives within our AUM and brokerage platforms. So that's what's driving this. It's a meaningful increase, but it's nothing - when you think about the 100 basis points that we've seen here, it's not a significant amount. Brian Moynihan : Just philosophically, we say to our team, you have to maintain the operating leverage, given a relative pricing against the rate curve, because the rate curve, we got to zero fullers for so long. And so they have to grow faster in the market 4% or 5%, at least, you've got to go deposits and you've got to maintain a pricing discipline. What happened at GWIM frankly is, they got a little behind the curve and they had to move in a single quarter and they did. And so what you see in the period-end deposits, even though the average I think is down, period-end actually is up. And so they were able to shutdown some of the runoff as, Paul just described, but it's really localized in the GWIM business, and it's really driven by a subset of those deposits, which are in asset management accounts and in brokerage accounts that are part of an investment strategy that that is different than transactional checking accounts and things that are driving both in our commercial business and our consumer business. And so that's why you see, if you go look at Page 10 and kind of sort through it, you'll see there's differences and it's really narrowly in the area that has to do with really investment cash rather than transitional and transactional cash. Steven Chubak : Thanks for that color, Brian. And so my understanding then is that, if we do see rate hikes from here, because much of this increase was a function of your efforts to catch up with the competition that - should we see the NIM introductory increase, or how should we think about the outlook from here if we get additional rate hikes? Paul Donofrio : Well, first, let me say that, our outlook on NII absent any change of rates. Is going to be dependent on loan and deposit growth, offset by deposit rate pay, which is mostly going to be driven here by competitive factors. So, if we get a 25 basis point rate hike in December, again, most of that will see in the first quarter, the benefit, and it's going to depend on what our customers need and want and what the competitive dynamic is. I mean, I don\u2019t know how else to answer that question. We don't know yet what we're going to do. We have to see how the market develops. Brian Moynihan : Secondly, in the $3.2 billion for 100 basis points is modeled in a rate of change relative to that interest rate change for deposit pricing. We have better debt and because of the power of the franchise and things, we would expect to continue to maintain that discipline. Steven Chubak : Got it. And just one more for me on the credit side, the trends there continue to be quite positive and appears to be doing a lot better than many of your peers in that regard. I know the guidance you've given previously, at least, in the near-term, was that provision should approximate net charge-offs? We did begin to see some healthier building consumer. I'm just wondering how we should think about the near-term provision trajectory from here? Paul Donofrio : We still think provision is expected to roughly match net charge-offs. You could see some modest increase as we bounce around the bottom with respect to net charge-offs in commercial and as we build allowance in support of loan growth. However, these factors may be offset by the release of non-core consumer, real estate and energy as we sort of been experiencing here over the last few quarters. So, no change there. Steven Chubak : Okay. I mean, is 900 million as like a charge-off run rate, at least, in the near-term, a reasonable expectation? Paul Donofrio : Over the last five quarters, the average has been 900 million. Steven Chubak : Got it. Thanks so much for your help. Paul Donofrio : Yes. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll go next to the line of Matt O'Connor from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Brian Moynihan : Good morning, Matt. Matt O'Connor: Good morning. I was wondering if you could just elaborate a bit in terms of what you're seeing on the loan demand side, both on the commercial, corporate, as well as the consumer and obviously, the industry has slowed down overall, you made some comments about seeing more activity in pockets of consumer, and then along with that just your outlook for loan growth in the near-term here? Paul Donofrio : We've been - look, we've been experiencing solid long growth in consumer and GWIM and in - on the wholesale side and global banking you saw that again this quarter. We don't - so we talk about loan growth for the whole company being driven by deposit growth. And so if you think about our deposit growth and the size of our deposits relative to our loans, every quarter we grow deposits and we put as much of that to work as we can in loan growth and whatever doesn't go to loans and client growth goes into the investment portfolio or cash. So, if you're growing deposits sort of mid-single digit that means you\u2019re going to grow total loans low-single digits, we don't think that's going to change, given the current economic environment. But as you've seen, because we have a significant run off portfolio and All Other that has translated into mid single-digit loan growth in our business segments and that's what we're comfortable with. Matt O'Connor: And then, as we think about the deposit growth driving the balance sheet growth, you've got the flatter yield curve, and some people - my personal view is, if you get additional increase in the short end, you might have further flattening. I\u2019m just wondering the thought process to keep building the securities book and the mortgage book, you're seeing some banks shrinking the securities book and building cash instead and obviously there\u2019s a cost of doing that. But just the thought process to keep building securities here, as the curve has flattened pretty meaningfully? Paul Donofrio : Yes. Look, we are always thinking about the trade-off between earnings liquidity and capital, where we have risk framework that we operate in with respect to the securities portfolio. But remember, when you're growing deposits in consumer, 8%, those are we believe high-quality deposits. So they have a meaningful duration, and you've got to find investments on the asset side to match what you believe the duration of those deposits are. So, we're very thoughtful about it and we think about it all the time. We haven't made a lot of change into our operating. We\u2019re operating within our risk framework, and we feel good about kind of what we're doing there. Brian Moynihan : I think one of the things to remember is that as you think about deposits, so - in our trillion plus of deposits, we have significantly more consumer personal deposits than anybody else does, which then if you think through the resolution planning and how those are treated now as stuff. Those deposits are extremely valuable. If you think of the consumers, it was 4 basis points last year and 4 basis points this year, you're going to continue to grow those, because unless the curve flattens out in a way that would be below 4 basis points plus the FDIC, you start to think of it, which - no one thinks it is going to do. It's still very valuable idea to generate more customers and generate more deposits. But if we continue to really push that with - it\u2019s almost $900 billion in deposits in our GWIM consumer businesses, which are tremendously valuable in terms of what drives this franchisers profit. So there's no way we're turned down more customers with a good core deposits. Matt O'Connor: Yes, just a point I was getting at is, you're paying up a little bit on the deposit side in the Wealth Management business. You're paying up a little bit on the global banking side. And on the one hand you can afford to pay up to help out the customers and keep them assuming our products. But at the same time with a flatter yield curve, it just makes it less economical to do so other bank? Brian Moynihan : Yes, but I mean think about the all-in cost and it\u2019s still much - it's still very advantage, because a $600 million a quarter for the $1.2 trillion in deposits in total just think about that a second, and if you think that there's a lot of advantage in any yield curve. Paul Donofrio : Question is obviously focused on the right thing, it\u2019s focused on the economics. But remember, these are our customers, and we want to make sure that they have the right alternatives for them to make good decisions about where they want to keep a deposit, or whether they want some other alternative. Matt O'Connor: Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll go next to the line of Brian Kleinhanzl from KBW. Please go ahead. Brian Kleinhanzl : Yes, good morning. Brian Moynihan : Good morning. Brian Kleinhanzl : My first question was on the first mortgage production that you mentioned. You said that you\u2019re putting most of that on the balance sheet. Could you just give kind of a description of the type of paper that it is? Is it just two-year conforming? I mean, was that due to the duration of the loan book for that consumer? Paul Donofrio : These are our customers who are originating mortgage either through purchase or refinancing. And we like the risk profile, we know them. We\u2019re all focused on prime\u2019s and. super prime. And we - so it's mostly non-conforming, but there is some conforming in there. We still are selling some to the agencies and obviously that would - that has duration to the asset side to the extent, that starts to gain a lot, but we\u2019ll manage that and remember we\u2019re adding deposits. Brian Moynihan : Also don't think that we don't manage that - we manage that rate risk through a whole bunch of things, including derivatives and stuff too. So it's not like we just sit there and throw the long assets on and leave them there. Brian Kleinhanzl : Okay, thanks. And then you did call out the hiring of the sales staff about 2000 year-on-year, I mean, how do we measure the success of those hires? Is - how much of that is already in the run rate? I mean, was it an opportunity to take market share, or were you understaffed in certain areas? I mean, how should we think about the increase in sales staff? Brian Moynihan : We have a - how you should think about is that, you can't grow in a business, which is largely driven by face-to-face interaction for the Wealth Management business and the Commercial business in total and a large part of Consumer business. If you don't grow your sales force, you can't grow your production. If you don't grow your production, you can't grow your balances. And so all those balances were growing, loan balances and deposit balances and are all driven by having more sales capabilities. And so unless you assume your team isn't working hard, which is absolutely not the truth. The Bank of America team works very hard, you got to add more capacity and to serve the customers and we have tremendous opportunity. So whatever metric and you can stun yourself with the opportunity, the number of customers who have their banking accounts that are in our Wealth Management business and other banks, hundreds of billions of dollars of bank deposit balances, loan balances, the amount of middle market investment banking goes to competitors from our middle market clients is 70%, 80% of their activity, which we should be capturing a lot more of. So we added middle market investment bankers. So that capacity is acquirement. We look at all the markets, 90 markets in the U.S. We look at the relative market shares. We look at what we should be able to do. We look at how the team works together and we deploy those people in units and between six - five or six core business of operating markets to make sure building markets. So they can play off each other and then they work to get business together and refer business back and forth. So without that sales force build, you won't have growth in the future. Brian Kleinhanzl : All right great. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll go next to the line of Ken Usdin from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Ken Usdin : Thanks. Good Morning. Brian Moynihan : Good morning. Ken Usdin : Paul, I want to follow-up on consumer credit. There has been last day or so a lot of concern about card. Your card losses have been up a little bit, but very manageable. But I did notice you did, and you mentioned you built the card reserve to now 3.5%. I'm just wondering what kind of normalization are you expecting on the card losses to follow, to start, sorry? Paul Donofrio : Yes. So we've been growing our card book. We have a back book that is well seasoned. We have a front book that we're growing and that is seasoning like any other normal portfolio card and you're seeing, I think that across the industry. So we feel really very good about our card portfolio. We're focused on, again, prime and super prime. We're focused on our customers. We did see a modest pickup in NCOs year-over-year, but that was fully expected and planned for. So, nothing here from our perspective unusual. Ken Usdin : All right. So just expected gradual seasoning and that you're not expecting any kind of vintage major shift in the recent growth? Brian Moynihan : If you think about the whole card business as we reshaped it over the last 10 years quite frankly has been a move to more and more relationship customers whose credit statistics are relatively consistent over time. And so, while we have a year-over-year increase in card charge-offs, linked quarter, it fell back down. And so you should expect this thing to see - bounce around in these rates. But it's because of the nature of the way we originate the cards as core relationship customers. And then our focus is not necessarily getting a lot more cards out there, it's really to get people to use their card as a primary card out of their wallet at Bank of America customer, the Bank of America card and using it and that's where we're driving the business. So, I don't think you expect - the strategy is responsible growth. So the balances grew $1 billion or $1.2 billion - a couple of billion here over the last year. But we know it's going to steady as you go and drive it, so you shouldn\u2019t see major changes in terms of nominal dollars of charge-offs. Ken Usdin : Understood. And then as a follow-up to that in terms of the new preferred rewards card, how will that work through? Will there be any type of amortization of rewards cost, et cetera that we should think about in terms of like the card fees line? How - or is that just also kind of already been as part of the spending you've been doing? Paul Donofrio : Yes. So let me just take a step back, because there\u2019s a lot of people on the call and just review what we did. So we did launch it last month. It's a card that we launched, because we were listening to our customers and we wanted to design a card that rewarded them. We rewarded those who wanted to deepen their relationship with us even further. And importantly, we also wanted to give them the flexibility to use their rewards the way they wanted to use them. Similar to all our other cards, we are very careful to balance the customer value with the shareholder value rewards that are very clear and transparent. We've been up and from seeing this card that we're not waiving. So we've been very mindful of the profitability of the product, and we don't expect any significant impact at this point anyways. We'll see how it goes, but at this point any significant impact to card income from existing upfront. Ken Usdin : Okay. Thanks a lot, Paul. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll go next to the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Jim Mitchell : Hey, good morning. Brian Moynihan : Hey, Jim. Jim Mitchell : Maybe a quick question on rate sensitivity, it looks like it didn't change despite absorbing another rate hike this past quarter. Is that sort of indication that you've gotten slightly more asset sensitivity, asset sensitive as the quarter went on, or how do we think about your flat rate sensitivity? A - Paul Donofrio I mean, if you look at rates at the end of last quarter and you look at rates where they are now, there really wasn't - hasn't been a lot of change. So that that's - it's the rate structure, both existing at the end of the quarter versus existing then plus what the forward path look like at both of those points that drives that asset sensitivity disclosure and they were kind of similar at both points. Jim Mitchell : Was there any change in the short versus long end sensitivity? Paul Donofrio : Not really, it's still around two-thirds short end. Jim Mitchell : Okay. And maybe just a broader question on consumer credit, I mean, I think that's a big issue. I heard your comment on cards. But maybe just taking - looking at the consumer as a whole, do you feel like there's any stress points out there that that gives you some pause? I think that's really what's going on in the industry, or at least in a lot of investors' minds worrying about, is this the start of a new upward cycle in consumer credit costs and how do you think about that? Paul Donofrio : Look, we - again, we\u2019re focused on prime, super prime. Jim Mitchell : Yes. Paul Donofrio : We\u2019re focused on our customers and we're just not seeing it in that group. I'm looking at a page here, it's got residential [ph] on it. And after you adjust for the OCC bankruptcy and the repossession, if you look at card, if you look at auto, if you look at consumer vehicle lending and you make an appropriate adjustment net charge-offs, they haven't really gone up linked quarter or versus Q1. So, we're just not seeing it yet in our net charge-offs. Jim Mitchell : Is there any reason\u2026. Brian Moynihan : That\u2019s a multi-year discipline. This is not something that happened this quarter. This is - multi-years of changing the underwriting standards and sticking to it and not varying those standards as we move through time. So we changed the mortgage underwriting standards in 2007 and 2008. We changed the card standards about the same time, which, the auto standards have always been high. We\u2019ve always made that a business that we took very little credit risk in. And so when you think about it, we just don't see it, but it's - a lot of it's just sticking to the netting over the years in and to the responsible growth strategy and the team finding the growth in the customers. And so the debates always been, can you grow? And the answer is, yes. But you've got to grow in a rational responsible basis, so and that's what's playing out in us this quarter relative to other people, I think. Jim Mitchell : Right. Okay, great. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. We'll go next to the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Brian Moynihan : Good morning, Gerard. Gerard Cassidy : Hi, Brian, how are you? Brian Moynihan : Good. Gerard Cassidy : You'd mentioned, Brian, on the call about going into different markets with de novo expansion of your retail branches. Can you give us some color on how long it takes to get to those branches to break-even? And then second, how long does it take to get them to a level of profitability that's similar to your legacy branches? Brian Moynihan : Well, I think the - it takes a while to build them up to the level of deposits obviously. But what we've seen so far and that's going to be one of the things you test every quarter is the - some of the branches we opened in Denver quickly moved into the top 10% of sales and stuff. Now, why is that different than the de novo branching? A, we have a nationwide brand. B, we have Wealth Management and Commercial businesses in all these markets. C, we have card customers and mortgage customers and its markets that were - that we've had for years. And so you\u2019re - a lot of times you\u2019re converting a deepening proposition as opposed to I'm opening a store and seeing what comes in. And the fourth is, we strategically locate them near where the rest of our teammates are and drive it. So they're getting up to speed faster. I won't give you the exact date that we target and things like that, because it\u2019s proprietary. But you just assume that they're getting up to speed faster. And you should assume that we're smart enough that we're not going to build them if they don't work. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And then second, we're all familiar with the treasury white papers that have come out about where they think regulation as you go through the banks. When you guys review what has come out, what are the top one, two or three items that when you sit down with the new Vice Chairman of the Fed, Quarles, what are you going to talk to him about? And as part of that answer, can you share with us your thinking on where is your operational RWA? And is that a big issue for you to talk to the regulators about changing in the future? Paul Donofrio : Sure. So on the first point on the white papers and all the other stuff that you\u2019ve been seeing, look, as an industry, I think, it goes without saying that we really have a vested interest in regional regulation that, but that also promotes safety and soundness. So we are very focused on that. I would say that, we are for regulatory refinement that promotes economic growth while protecting its financial stability. There has been a lot of discussion out there, a lot of white papers, a lot of great points that are being made in those papers. But we would be in favor sort of generally in the type of refinement that allows us more access and control over our capital and liquidity in support of responsible growth that we've been talking about all throughout this call, in support of the economy and the communities where we live and work, and for lending and for capital return. We've talked about the - how large our buffer is. We'd also like to see a little bit more efficient regulation driven by amortization across the regulatory bodies. So, we're going to work with whatever parties we can to see some of this get refined in a responsible way. On your second question was on RWA, oh, on operational risk capital, yes, one of our favorite subjects. Yes, look, we have a third of our advanced RWA is operational risk RWA, it is a floor that has been given to us by regulators. That 500 billion is 33% more than our next closest competitor has in operational risk RWA. That 500 billion is more RWA than just about all the European banks have in total RWA. So, we would like to make progress on that. The advanced approach is something we used to manage risk at the company, so it\u2019s important to have an accurate amount of RWA as we think about how we are managing the company.  Having said all that, I would point out that at least in the United States with the Collins amendment, we have to have an amount of RWA that is the higher of standardized and advanced and as we continue to make progress on optimizing how we deliver the customers and clients, we are optimizing our advanced RWA and it is getting closer and closer to standardize. So at some point standardize will likely become our binding constraint. That doesn't mean that the operational risk capital is not important, it is, but it - but to generalize, at some point it will become our binding constraint and make that a little bit move. Gerard Cassidy : Very good, and then just finally, Paul, you mentioned I think on the call about the higher rep and warranty expense. Can you guys kind of frame for us what's left there? And obviously, I'm assuming we're towards the tail end, but do you guys know about what's left? Paul Donofrio : Look, we don\u2019t really go through them line by line. I think you guys know all the big ones. I will happy to sort of list a couple of those if you want. What I would say is, if you look at our disclosures we still have 2 billion in reserves for reps and warranties and we have got another 2 billion leased as of the end of the second quarter in the RPL for reps and warranties. So we are going to work through things and we are going to see over time how all that plays out. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. Brian, we will see you in Boston. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We will take our final question from the line of Saul Martinez from UBS. Please go ahead. Saul Martinez : Hi, thanks for taking my question. I want to ask about a follow up on efficiency and cost performance beyond 2018 and where do you think your efficiency ratio can go to, so you\u2019ve obviously, you have brought down you efficiency ratio to 60%. If you get to the 53 billion whenever that is 18 or whenever you there around 18, you drive down your efficiency ratio even further to [indiscernible], so you are pretty close to, sort of, your competitors despite the fact that your business mix is one that has more wealth management and which has a higher efficiency ratio, so how should we think about your ability, the opportunity set to continue to drive positive operating leverage over a multi-year period and get your efficiency ratio down even further to the mid-to-low 50% range and I know it\u2019s a difficult question to answer, and it depends on a lot of things, but with technology and AI and cognitive computing and digitization and mobile banking, can we see efficiency ratios that maybe a few years ago we wouldn\u2019t have even thought for a bank like Bank of America. Brian Moynihan : Well I think there are a number of things. Number one, you\u2019ve got the general picture right, which is, we're getting it down to 53 that puts us in the level, we have a higher procession of wealth management, which has revenue related compensation that obviously is 27% pretax margin, you flip that around 83% efficiency ratio and it is a meaningful amount of dollars, but it is a great return on capital business and last thing you want to do is not grow it. So that creates a dynamic around, you know the aggregation of all these numbers and you look at the other ones in their 50-ish type of numbers across the board. So we're going to drive that. When you think about it in the future the way we talk about it is the 53 billion is the 18 target, we try to hold it flattish after that, you know sliding [ph] to apply technology all things you talked about, more digitization and the earlier callers - the earlier questioners talked about and using that to offset, you know the fact that medical care premiums go up 6%, 7%, something else goes up, the rents go up and things like that and pay for all that, and merit increases and bigger bonus pools because our teammates are doing a good job. So all that, you're fighting that and if you keep it flattish and then a question of what scenario you are playing into, your rates rise a little bit that [indiscernible] and that is what we told you guys before and that\u2019s what we will tell you in the future. There is no additional cost to that. If it comes through wealth management fee generation, it\u2019s going to have more expense attached to it. So it is a little bit of what\u2019s your scenario you're playing into. We don't target - the efficiency ratio is a result of all the hard work that goes in to keep expenses flat, down to 53 billion and flattish after that. That will then produce an efficiency ratio based little bit on the revenue scenario, which could be on the economics and what\u2019s going on out there, but you should, rest assured, after $20 billion expenses in the last five years taking out of the company that there is no team that is more focused on this than the team that works for me. Saul Martinez : Okay great. That's very helpful. Thanks a lot. Operator : We would like to go over to Mr. Moynihan for closing remarks. Brian Moynihan : Thank you, Operator. Let me just wrap up quickly. Thank you all for being on the call today and thank you and look forward to talking to you next quarter. As you think about Bank of America for the quarter three of 2017 it\u2019s pretty straightforward, responsible growth. It is evidence across the company in all different fashions, whether it is [indiscernible]. We got to grow no excuses, you saw that in balances and revenue, you got to do with the right customer focus, got to do with the right risk, and we got to do it and be sustainable. When we say sustainable that means we got to do it and keep investing in the future and you saw us do that also. When we do that right we can take more capital and deliver back to you through dividends and share buybacks and as we told you earlier we nearly double that year-over-year. So, thank you and we look forward to talking to you next quarter. Operator : I\u2019d like to thank everybody for their participation. Please feel free to disconnect at any time.",

Currently all phone lines are in a listen-only mode. Later there will be an opportunity to ask questions during the question answer session. [Operator Instructions]Please be advised today\u2019s program maybe recorded.  It is now my pleasure to turn the program over to Mr. Lee McEntire. You may begin, sir. Lee McEntire : Good morning. Thanks to everyone for joining this morning\u2019s call to review our 4Q 2017 results. Hopefully everybody's got a chance to review the earnings release documents on the Investor Relations section of our bankofamerica.com website. I will just remind you we may make some forward-looking statements in the discussion today. For further information on those, please refer to either our earnings release documents, our website, or our SEC filings. Brian Moynihan, our Chairman and CEO will make some opening comments. Paul Donofrio, our CFO will review the 4Q results, and then will turn it back over to Brian for just a few thoughts from the company as we head into 2018 before we open up for questions. Brian, take it away. Brian Moynihan : Sure, Lee. Thank you and thank everyone for joining us today. Good morning. This was another strong quarter and year for our company across the board. We drove positive operating leverage consistently through the year. In fact, this is the twelfth straight quarter where we have had reported a positive operating leverage on a year-over-year basis and you can see that on Slide 3 and we did it the right way. We achieved it through fundamental operating excellence, driving revenue, controlling expenses combined with strong relationships in sales production. Full year revenue is up 5% excluding the Tax Act impact while expenses declined 1%. Our business generated 6% loan growth for the year. We grew and remained true to a responsible growth operating model where there is a clear recognition throughout the company of who our targeted customers are and how we manage risk in our desired outcomes. Let me highlight a little of the progress. For the year we reported $18 billion in after tax net income excluding the Tax Act impact of $2.9 billion, we would have reported net income of $21 billion, which is up 18% over a solid 2016. This represents the highest earnings run rate for the company in its history.  Paul will discuss the Tax Act impacts in a little more detail later. Our company remains balanced with earnings coming relatively evenly from our consumer and our commercial institutional segment businesses. On our more businesses for people, our consumer businesses and our wealth management businesses, together they earn more than $11 billion and grew 14% while our Global Banking and Global Markets business together generated about $10 billion and they are up 7%.  Excluding the Tax Act impact, our return on tangible common equity was 11% and our return on average \u2013 return on assets was 93 basis points pushing close to our long-term targets. Across the board in our businesses, our brand improved in every area recognized by many outside parties and through a higher stock price and improved credit ratings, we saw tangible benefits of our progress.  Shareholders not only saw a share price improvement, but we increased our dividend by 60% and reduced our fully diluted share count during the year by 3.4%. Average diluted shares were down 370 million from this time last year and down nearly 1 billion from the peak. With an improved CCAR plus our additional 5 billion we\u2019ll continue to make progress in this area.  At the core of our model is [indiscernible] group of teammates, our best assets, therefore we continue to invest heavily in making our company the best place for our teammates to work, [indiscernible] continue to rank high in overall list of the best companies to work for, we rank in the top 50 list the best workplace to show diversity, for parents, for working mothers and Hispanics among others.  You can see some of these accolades on the couple of the appendix slides we added to the packets this time. This year we also invested heavily in our teammates for improvements and starting minimum wages at where we have put them at $15 this time last year. We had more \u2013 we introduced Sabbatical, family leaving increases, leave policy extensions and wellness initiatives. The latest example is our announcement at the year end, we were able to provide nearly 70% of our teammates with a bonus to share in the future success of the expected benefits of the tax savings.  As Paul will explain, this added about a $145 million in dividend expenses in the fourth quarter. We\u2019ve been also investing to continue to lower the cost to make - so we can make more money in our franchise. We also lowered cost so we continued our investments in digital capabilities for security protection for our customers; we show in our online and mobile banking leadership rankings.  We also rolled out digital shopping capabilities in auto and in home. We are also heavily investing in capabilities and our investment clients across the wealth management spectrum through our award-winning digital brokerage capabilities, as well as our treasury capabilities for our commercial clients. Our consumer mobile banking app became the first apps in the Apple App Store to be certified by J.D. Power.  We know there is much more to do to continue to drive this positive change in our company and for the benefit of our customers and clients. So we as a team are proud of the outcome today for sure, but even more proud that we are approving, that we can win and do it the right way through driving responsible growth and we plan to do that in the future. With that, let me turn it over to Paul to give you comments on the quarter. Paul Donofrio : Thank you, Brian. I want to go back to Slide 2 to start. We reported net income of $2.4 billion or $0.20 per diluted share in Q4. Late in the quarter we informed investors through an 8-K filing that we expected an impact of approximately $3 billion from the Tax Act. Our estimated impact came in just shy of $2.9 billion lowering EPS by $0.27.  Remember, the Tax Act is complex with several novel provisions. Any [current filing] [ph] guidance for new information could affect our estimated impact. As noted in our materials, the impact was recorded in two places.  First, in other income, there was a charge of approximately $950 million to revalue certain renewable energy investments, within the income tax line, this pretax charge was offset by the tax benefits of this $950 million charge, plus the new value of certain deferred tax liabilities associated with these renewable energy investments. In total, the tax line includes $1.9 billion aggregate expense with the multiple impacts of the Tax Act including the tax benefit of the charge for new energy investments that I just mentioned as well as the revaluation of our deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities.  In our materials, we\u2019ve provided charts reflecting results on a basis that excludes the Tax Act impacts. We believe this provides a more clear comparison to Q4 2016. On that basis, net income was $5.3 billion with EPS of $0.47 per share growing 20% year-over-year. Return on return on tangible common equity was 11%, return on assets was 90 basis points, operating leverage year-over-year was a strong 8%. Revenue was $21 billion improving 7%, an 11% improvement in net interest income drove revenue growth. Expenses declined 1%, which included roughly $200 million with the shared success bonuses in late December that Brian mentioned, plus an acceleration of planned charitable contribution in late December as we looked to share some of the future tax savings with our teams and the communities we serve. Provision expense was $1 billion, up $227 million, driven by a $333 million impact from the charge-offs and reserve build for a single commercial exposure. Negative news reports on that company caused significant market concerns which affected the credit spreads and stock price of this formerly investment grade credit.  Despite downgrades of this credit, both non-performing loans and criticized commercial exposures declined from Q3. And excluding this specific loss, net charge-offs remained very low.  Turning to the balance sheet on Slide 4, overall, compared to September 30, end of period assets up $2.3 trillion were mostly unchanged. Loans grew $10 billion, but were offset by a $14 billion decrease in cash. On the funding side, strong deposit growth from Q3 of $25 billion was offset by reductions in markets funding and lower equity.  Debt levels were stable with prior period. However, we did complete an $11 billion debt exchange offer in the quarter, which extended maturities and improved the structure of this debt from a TLAC perspective. Liquidity remains strong with average global liquidity sources of $522 billion and we ended the quarter with a liquidity coverage ratio of a 125%.  Equity decreased $4.8 billion from Q3. This quarter, through the purchase to both the purchase of our common shares and common dividends, we returned more than $6.1 billion to shareholders. That was $4 billion more than the $2.1 billion in income available to common, which included the $2.9 billion Tax Act charge. The remaining decline in equity was mostly result of the decline in OCI as increases in long-end rates decreased the value of our debt securities portfolio. We purchased 174 million shares in Q4 and have repurchased 509 million shares in the past twelve months.  Remember, this quarter where we see the pull for $5 billion in share repurchases in addition to our previously announced $12.9 billion following CCAR. Tangible book value per share of $16.96 was modestly above Q4 2016 as earnings over the year including the Tax Act impact offset share repurchases and dividends, as well as the convergence of Berkshire preferred stocks to common shares.  Turning to regulatory metrics and focusing on the fully phased-in impacts. Our CET1 ratio declined this quarter. The primary cause of the decline was a return of capital to shareholders in excess of earnings, which obviously included the Tax Act impact.  Focusing on risk-weighted assets and starting with the advanced approach, RWA was flat from Q3 at $1.46 trillion as DTA reductions and the run-off of legacy loans with high risk weights offset general loan growth. Under the standardized approach where risk sensitivity is less, funded and unfunded loan growth across the businesses drove a $22 billion increase in RWA.  The CET1 ratio under advanced declined 34 basis points to 11.5% and the standardized ratio declined 52 basis points to 11.7%, both ratios remain well above our 9.5 requirement and supplementing leverage ratios continued to exceed U.S. regulatory minimums.  Turning to Slide 5. On an average basis, total loans increased to $928 billion. Note that the Q2 sales of UK cards, which was a quarter than all other, impacted the year-over-year comparisons of average loans by $9 billion. In Q4, we also sold our remaining student loans and manufactured housing loans totaling to approximately $800 million. Adjusting for these sales, average loans were up $29 billion or 3% year-over-year. Loan growth continued to be dampened by the run-off of non-core consumer real estate loans in all other. Year-over-year loans in all other were down $29 billion inclusive of the loan sales.  On the other hand, loans in our business segments were up $49 billion or 6%. Consumer banking led with a 9% increase with solid growth across mortgage, credit cards and vehicle loans. Wealth management\u2019s strong growth of 7% was driven by mortgages to structured lending. Origination of new home equity loans continued to be outpaced by pay downs. Growth in global banking loans and leases remains solid, up 4% year-over-year.  Switching to average deposits and looking at the bottom right, growth was $43 billion or nearly 3.5% year-over-year. This growth was driven by consumer banking which increased by a $48 billion or nearly 8% year-over-year. Average deposits declined year-over-year in wealth management as clients moved cash to other alternatives within brokerage or AUM. This decline was mostly offset by solid growth in global banking.  Turning to asset quality on Slide 6. Total net charge-offs were $1.2 billion or 53 basis points of average loans. As mentioned, the quarter was impacted by the one large single commercial charge-off. Excluding this single loss, net charge-offs and the net charge-off ratio were consistent with Q3. Also due largely to this commercial loss provision of $1 billion was up $167 million from Q3 2017 and $227 million from Q4 2016. Provision expense included a $236 million net reserve release. The net reserve release reflects continued improvement and our legacy consumer real estate and energy portfolios. Our reserve coverage remains strong with an allowance to loan coverage ratio of 112 basis points and a coverage level of 2.6 times our full year net charge-offs. On Slide 7, we break out credit quality metrics for both consumer and commercial portfolios. With respect to Consumer, net charge-offs of $769 million were up $38 million from Q3. The modest uptick in net losses is negatively impacted by the absence of some prior period recoveries, the Q3 2017 storm-related payment deferrals and seasonality.  The Consumer credit card net charge-off ratio increased to 2.78% as the portfolio continues its expected seasoning. Consumer NPL of $5.2 billion declined from Q3 and or at the lowest they\u2019ve been since Q2 2008 and 45% of our Consumer NPLs are current on their payments. Commercial losses, excluding the one large credit already discussed were stable. Reservable criticized exposure was down more than $1 billion from Q3.  Turning to Slide 8, net interest income on a GAAP non-FTE basis was $11.5 billion, $11.7 billion on an FTE basis. Compared to Q4 2016, GAAP NII is up $1.2 billion or more than 11% driven by the spread improvements in our asset yields and funding cost.  Partially offsetting the spread improvement is the lack of interest income associated with the UK card portfolio which was sold in Q2 2017. The increase year-over-year was also driven by both the home and the securities as well as lower prepayments and therefore lower bond premium write-offs.  Focusing on the net interest yield, it improved 16 basis points from Q4 2016 to 2.39%. Compared to Q3 2017, NII increased $300 million driven by loans, securities, and asset growth in global markets, as well as a run up of short-end rates in anticipation of the FED funds cut and the deferrals.  With respect to deposit pricing, we raised rates modestly on selected wealth management products as well as for certain commercial clients. Consumer rates paid remains stable. NII on a full year basis grew $3.6 billion or 9% to $4.7 billion.  In 2018, we expect solid NII growth driven by loan and deposit growth in some net interest yield expansion assuming the forward curve plays out as currently expected. But, I would remind you that 2017 included approximately $0.5 billion of interest from the UK card business that we sold. This will be a significant offset to NII growth in 2018. In 2018, we also don\u2019t expect the same full year benefits from the reduced premium amortization experienced in 2017 given the increase in rates that borrowers have already experienced. More short-term, as you think about NII in Q1 2018, we expect to benefit from the December rate hikes. Having said that, remember, there will be two less days in Q1 than Q4, that should reduce NII by approximately $175 million.  Also, NII from loan growth in Q1 is normally muted by seasonal declines in card loans. One other item worth noting as you think about Q1, the Tax Act will lower NII on an FTE basis, because the NII growth up will be lower. However, remember, NII growth up on an FTE basis is completely offset by higher tax expense resulting in no change in earnings. Still, on an FTE basis, NII is expected to decrease by approximately $120 million each quarter. On a GAAP basis, again, NII is not impacted. With respect to asset sensitivity as at 12/31 an instantaneous 100% basis point parallel increase in rates is estimated to increase NII by $3.3 billion over the subsequent 12 months. This is largely unchanged from September 30 and approximately two-thirds driven by our sensitivity to short-term rates.  Turning to Slide 9, we had another solid quarter of expense management. Note this quarter includes an accounting change for the retirement eligible incentives. Previously, this expense which was historically just over $1 billion was recorded in Q1 when awards were granted. We will now record \u2013 we will now account for an estimate of next year\u2019s grant ratably over current year\u2019s four quarters. Prior periods in this quarter\u2019s supplemental materials have been restated for this change.  Non-interest expense of $13.3 billion was down $140 million or 1% from Q4 2016. Note that this amount includes the two actions which totaled approximately $200 million than in the prior year to share pretax savings with lower paid employees and the communities we serve. Excluding these discretionary actions, expenses were down 2%.  In addition to cost savings associated with the sale of our UK Card business, year-over-year improvements in non-interest expense will be broadly distributed across expense categories as we continue to focus on SIM, understanding improving our work processes and optimizing the company\u2019s consumer delivery network.  We expect these benefits over the medium-term to drive efficiencies that will help us offset inflationary cost and potentially increases in investments. Compared to Q3 2017, expenses declined by $120 million despite the late quarter discretionary spend. The decline was driven by a lower mortgage servicing cost and lower revenue-related incentives in our global markets business.  Excluding the Tax Act\u2019s impacts on revenue, our efficiency ratio of 62% was above our target reflecting the typical seasonal weakness in our sales inflating business.  Okay, turning to the business segments and starting with Consumer Banking on Slide 10, Q4 caps a tremendous year for this business. On a full year basis, earnings were $8.2 billion growing 14% over 2016 with operating leverage driving the efficiency ratio to 50% by the end of the year.  Focusing on Q4 results, earnings at $2.2 billion grew 14% year-over-year and returned 24% on allocated capital. Year-over-year, this business created over 600 basis points of operating leverage as revenue growth of 10% outpaced expense growth of 4%.  Higher interest rates and growth in client balances drove the year-over-year improvement in revenue. Year-over-year average loans were 9%. Average deposits grew 8% and Merrill Edge brokerage assets grew 22%. Cost of deposits which reflects non-interest expense as a percent of average deposits increased modestly because of year-end discretionary actions mentioned earlier to share future tax savings with low pay employees and the communities we serve. Net charge-offs increased $107 million from Q4 2016 as we continued to experience modest and expected seasoning of our credit card portfolio and loan growth. Provision expense increased $126 million in Q4 2016. The net charge-off ratio remains low at 1.21%.  Turning to Slide 11 and looking at key trends. As I mentioned earlier, revenue increased 10% year-over-year. Within revenue, mortgage banking income was the only major category that was lower year-over-year driven by bond declines. In Q4, we retained about 90% of our first mortgage production on balance sheet.  Looking at revenue more broadly, we believe our relationship deepening, Preferred Rewards program is improving NII and growth of balances and allowing cost savings. These benefits are more than offsetting headwinds in the non-interest income line that our industry is facing. Spending levels on debit and credit cards were up 7% year-over-year and we issued 1.1 million new cards \u2013 new credit cards in the quarter, in line with last year. Spending levels and the one-time partner rebate drove a 5% revenue increase in card income, which continues to be impacted by strong competition on the rewards front. Service charges were up a more modest 1% and in 4Q we modestly revised our overdraft policy by eliminating certain fees. This revision reduced overall fees but has benefits and that it will improve customer satisfaction while helping to lower servicing costs.  By the way, customer satisfaction in Consumer Banking reached an historic high with roughly 80% of our clients rating us 9 or 10 at a 10 point scale. Focusing on client balances, on the bottom of the page, you can see the success we\u2019ve continued to have growing deposits, loans and brokerage assets. We remained focused on prime and super prime borrowers with average book FICO scores of at least 760.  Expenses were up 4% compared to Q4 2016 as the year end special bonus impacted this business more heavily than others. Otherwise, investments in renovating branches and technology initiatives modestly outpaced continued optimization and saving from digitalization.  To give you a sense of the type and level of continued investment in our financial centers, let me highlight a few facts. During 2017, we opened 30 new financial centers with 25 of these in de novo areas not previously served by our retail network, but in areas where we have existing wealth management and/or commercial banking presence. We also opened 41 student centers and 69 lending centers and branded 585 Merrill Lynch offices. We also renovated nearly 300 financial centers and replaced more than 3400 ATMs.  Turning to Slide 12 and focusing on the continued improvement in digital banking trends. As you can see the year-over-year growth in these metrics continues to be impressive. We remained the leader in digital banking. We now have nearly 35 million digital users including 24 million accessing their accounts through mobile devices.  We process payments for customers valued at $669 billion in Q4, annualized, that equates to over $2.5 trillion per year and note the 10% growth of digital payments relative to non-digital ebb 1% as customers continue to migrate from cash and checks helping us improve efficiency and reduce risk. In particular, note P2P payments increasing. They doubled from Q4 2016 as day deduction makes it easier to send, request and even split person to person money transfers. Also note on the bottom left the growth in mobile channel users with 1.3 billion log-ins. Also noteworthy is the volume of mobile deposit transactions which now represents 23% of all deposit transactions and while still small, half of all our retail direct all loan applications are originated digitally following the recent rollout of our digital auto shopping capabilities last quarter.  These digital trends and the investment behind them, plus the continued investment in our financial centers that I earlier listed must be thought out together as you evaluate and we execute on our high touch, high tech, high touch customer strategy.  Turning to Global Wealth and Investment Management on slide 13, Q4\u2019s earnings of $742 million, up 17% from Q4 2016, a pretax margin of 26% and a return on allocated capital of 21%. Market appreciation and client flows were once again a tailwind for asset management fees offsetting modest spread compression, at the same time, brokerage revenue continued to face headwinds as volumes declined and mix shifted.  All in, revenue grew 7% year-over-year with strong NII improvement and 16% growth in asset management fees, partially offset by lower brokerage revenues. This activity coupled with careful expense management drove 4% operating leverage. This quarter we saw AUM flows of $18 billion bringing flows for the year to nearly $100 billion.  Year-over-year expenses were up 3% driven by revenue-related incentives, as well as investments in both primary sales professionals and technologies.  Moving to Slide 14, we continue to see solid overall client engagement. Client balances rose to $2.75 trillion driven by higher market values, solid AUM flows and continued loan growth. As we noted during the reviews of previous quarters, clients started to more oppressively move deposits into cash investment alternatives within AUM and brokerage starting early in the year. In the second half of the year, trends improved as we increased rates paid on certain products. Average loans of $157 billion grew 7% year-over-year continuing the trend of clients deepening their relationship with us. Loan growth remained concentrated in consumer real estate as well as structured lending.  Turning to Slide 15. Global Banking earned $1.7 billion increasing 6% from Q4 2016. Return on allocated capital was 17% and stable with last year despite an increase in allocated capital.  I want to talk about full year results for a moment behind the success of this business in 2017. On a full year basis, Global Banking set several records including revenue of $20 billion and net income of $7 billion.  Full year earnings were up 21%, a strong operating leverage. Revenue grew 8%, while expenses were up only 1% as the business reduced overhead to offset increases in investments and we added more than 400 bankers over the past few years as we continue to deepen and expand local coverage in commercial and business banking. Returning to Q4 year-over-year comparisons, revenue growth of 10% was driven by improved NII reflecting solid loan and deposit growth compounded by rising short-term interest rates. We also grew IBCs 16% year-over-year. Growth was led by advisory fees, but debt and equity fees were also up year-over-year.  The efficiency ratio improved 200 basis points to 43%. Provision expense of $132 million increased from Q4 2016 as a result of a commercial charge-off mentioned earlier. Half of the loss was recorded in Global Banking and half in Global Markets. Provision expense also included some release of reserves on our energy portfolio which continued to improve.  Growth of loans in Global Banking remains fairly consistent with past several quarters increasing 4% year-over-year. The outlook for loan growth given tax reform remains to be seen, but optimum \u2013 optimism among our clients is high. However, we also expect some of our clients to use repatriate funds and tax savings to pay down borrowings and other obligations.  Looking at trends on Slide 16 and comparing to Q4 last year, with respect to average loans, growth of 4% was led by corporate borrowers, evenly balanced between domestic and international clients. Within commercial lending, C&I rose 5% while commercial real estate was flat.  In Global Banking, loan spreads were down one basis point compared to Q3 2017 continuing the trend we\u2019ve seen all year which modestly compressed spreads year-over-year by mid single-digits.  Average deposits rose $14 billion or 5% compared to Q4 2016 with most of the increase concentrated in the second half of the year reflecting increases in rate paid in Q3 and Q4. As interest rates rise, the value of these deposits and the relationships they represent is best seen in global transaction revenue which is up 10% year-over-year to nearly $2 billion. Total investment banking fees of $1.4 billion finished the year strong growing 16% versus Q4 2016. Advisory fees hit a new record. For full year 2017, we ranked number three in overall investment banking fees with fees totaling $6 billion, up 15% from 2016.  Okay, switching to Global Markets on Slide 17. I will review results excluding DDI. Global Markets generated revenue of $3.5 billion and earned $0.5 billion. Year-over-year, earnings were down by $238 million driven by lower sales in trading results, higher technology investment spending and provisions.  Revenue was down 2% year-over-year as the decline in sales and trading revenue was partially offset by a gain on the sale of a non-core asset recorded in other income. Sales of trading revenue held up better from the middle of the quarter end through the end of the year than it did in the prior year. Sale of trading of $2.7 billion declined 9% from Q4 2016, fixed sales and trading of $1.7 billion decreased 13%, with this effect the decrease was driven by less favorable market conditions across macro products particularly rates.  Equity sales and trading at just shy of $1 billion was stable year-over-year as growth in client financing activity offset declines in cash and derivatives trading given lower levels of volatility and client activity. With respect to expenses, Q4 2017 was 5% higher than Q4 2016 as lower revenue-related incentive cost were more than offset by continued investments in technology. Moving to trends on Slide 18 and looking at trends across the last three years, we would highlight the following. First, starting in the lower left box, full year total trading revenue has been fairly consistent over the last three years at $13 billion to $13.6 billion. And note that we have achieved this stability while reducing our expensed RWA.  Now, the launch and rolled over last few years and that change was reflected in activity and volatility that very greatly, from both a product and regional perspective over the last three years. Still, we were able to cruise relatively consistent revenue and reduced risk over this time period. We believe this consistency shows that clients value the diversity and comprehensiveness of our global markets capabilities including sales and trading as well as research in every major market across the globe.  On Slide 19, we show all other, which reported a loss of $2.7 billion. A few things to note this quarter, the $2.9 billion impact from the Tax Act was recorded here. So excluding that charge, all other would have produced a profit of a little over $200 million.  Unrelated to the Tax Act, all other results also include the $0.4 billion tax benefit from the restructuring of certain subsidiaries. Revenue from early Q4 2016 excluding the impact of taxes were down a little more than $130 million year-over-year. Remember when comparing year-over-year, Q4 2016 included expenses and charge-offs for the UK card portfolio sold in 2017. The tax rate this quarter was impacted by the negative impacts of the Tax Act as well as the benefit of the unrelated subsidiary restructuring. With respect to tax rate in 2018, prior to tax reforms, we expected our GAAP tax rate for 2018 to be around 29% before unusual items.  Now we expect the GAAP tax rate to be approximately 20% absent unusual items and remember when thinking about tax rate on an FTE basis, the difference in GAAP and FTE has now narrowed from two basis points to one basis point.  This reflects the preliminary analysis on the non-deductibility of FDIC premiums, the global mix of our profits and other tax reform provisions.  Okay, let me turn it back to Brian for a couple of closing comments before we open it up for Q&A. Brian Moynihan : Thanks, Paul. As we wrap up, we thought it\u2019d be useful to hit a couple questions from the top that Paul and I\u2019ve been fielding and is a tactic one has become more reality. The first question we get often is, how do our clients that how do we feel about the tax reform and the client activity. It\u2019s clear from what our clients tells that tax reform be a positive for our clients and customers in nine states.  There are two key elements from the standpoint of Corporate American Tax Reform, first the lower competitive tax rate and second the territorial system and both these were accomplished in the tax reform. This coupled with the continued regulatory reform agenda to balance regulation how well received by businesses and this increased confidence will ultimately make it and undoubtedly make it into the business plans.  And as one of the largest banks in nine states, we will benefit that \u2013 with that as our customers grow and invest. That being said, those customers justice we at Bank of America will look and our other peers in our industry are carefully evaluating alternatives to reinvest some portion of those savings to drive further business activities to help grow our company and achieve even more competitiveness.  The second question I get is, there is our focus change and we run the company differently given a lower tax rate and end of day is no. We are going to remain focused on driving responsible growth, continually trying to connect that with our customers, striving to make it easier for those customers to do business with us and for our employees to do business inside the company. We will continue to drive operational excellence, lowering operational expenses as we\u2019ve done for many quarters in a row and improving our competitiveness as we develop and invest in new products and services. We are also continuing to drive our share return model and we expect that largest portion has benefits from tax will be reviewed by our shareholders.  In the end, whether through increased investments, capital distributions or supporting our clients, all this will benefit the economy and shareholders and drive our activities consistently responsible growth.  Third question is, do we think that the impact of tax reform will affect loan growth. Near term it will be tougher to tell that people repatriate money or receive more after tax cash flow. The question is will they pay it on our loans and perhaps they will. However in the medium to long-term, more after tax cash flow came from real estate business and we will benefit by greater loan growth as those businesses invest those proceeds.  We believe the real test of our loan growth will be more the general economy and how it\u2019s growing and less about the tax rate. Another question we often get is this tax reform change or come into $53 billion goal for 2018. I\u2019ll start out by pointing out that if you look our expenses in fourth quarter, we effectively reached a runrate expense in the $53 billion range. We reported $13.3 billion in the quarter. If you back out the $200 million in additional bonuses and the accelerated charitable contribution that leaves us just about $13.1 billion, if you multiply that times four and that\u2019s 52 and a quarter or so billion. If you add $400 million in these FICO related tax to come in the first quarter, and throw on top there a couple hundred million dollars of potential incentives due to fourth quarter being a lower trading quarter, you get around a $53 billion runrate. So effectively you\u2019ve reached your goal.  In the second quarter of 2016, we first announced the scope, I want to remind you that there is the expenses that were trailing at that time of $56 billion. It was on our business plan to hit that $53 billion in 2018, it\u2019s still is. But as we look forward, we have no doubt, as I said earlier that business is including our company, we\u2019ll have to look to take advantage of some of the tax savings to invest and improve their business and compete as faster as they would have done before the tax reform act.  So we continue to evaluate options for longer term value creation along the dimensions of the investments we have been making in branches, in technology and people. We will continue to assess this as we go through the year. However we\u2019ll be clear we\u2019d expect most of the benefits and tax reform will flow to the bottom-line through dividends and share buybacks over time. In addition, the investments we make will drive operational excellence and efficiencies that will continue to play to our benefit over time.  The next question I get is around capital return expectations, or will they change given the tax reform. The simple answer to that question is, yes. In 2017, we reported net income available to common shareholders is $16.6 billion and returned $16.8 billion back through share repurchase and dividends. WE don\u2019t need to make any acquisitions in the company in fact in nine states, the deposit acquisition is not legal. So our growth will have to be organic and will continue to be so. We believe we have sufficient capital to absorb our risk as we grow and in fact we have excess capital. We have the capital also to support our customers\u2019 demand for financing and we always want to use that capital first to help customers grow. So, yes, we will expect to return more capital to shareholders given the tax. That brings us the last question here for investors. How are we performing to return targets and do they need to increase for the tax savings implied in tax reform act going forward that Paul spoke about. This year excluding the impact of the tax act, we earned return on tangible common equity of 11% and return on assets of 93 basis points. In addition, either 12%, and 1% targets that we laid out few years ago. Going forward the benefits in tax reform will easily mathematically accelerate those and we\u2019ll reach those targets.  The potential lift in returns to be seen by just adding the benefits of the lower tax rate assuming 100% of the benefit is still at the bottom-line. This will equate to something north of 150 basis points of increased return on tangible common equity and more than ten basis points of increased return on average assets.  But as you keep in mind, we\u2019ve always been clear that the long-term targets were just a step to keep marking our continued path to driving this company\u2019s operating performance. So, yes, our targets will be obtained, but that doesn\u2019t lower our desire to drive responsible growth and continue to improve the company and continue to improve the returns and return of capital to you and we\u2019ll continue to do that.  So wrapping that up, we will stay focused on responsible growth in 2018. That\u2019s what got us here and what will get us here going forward. We\u2019ll control the things we can do and drive operating leverage about the company.  And with that, let me open it up for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we can take our first question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Betsy Graseck : Good morning. Brian Moynihan : Good morning. Paul Donofrio : Good morning. Betsy Graseck : Brian, I just wanted to follow-up on one of the comments you made around the expenses. As you indicated in the prepared remarks, the expense improvement has been fantastic and particular in the Consumer business where operating leverage has been very strong over the last two years.  I wanted to understand from your prepared remarks, you are saying that $53 billion, you\u2019ve already met it and you\u2019ll retain it for the full year or may change your outlook based on how the customer demand evolves with the tax plan and within that just wondering if you are expecting that you\u2019ll be able to generate more operating leverage in particular in the consumer space given the groundwork you\u2019ve laid in digital payments and the branch networks? Brian Moynihan : Sure, I think, what we are saying is that, just the \u2013 base principle, the vast majority of any increased after-tax cash flow will go to the shareholders. The question that we have to look at, Betsy as you reference is, is there an amount of investment that we may accelerate some of the things we are doing especially around consumer business but across all the business to accelerate the branch build out and some of the cities that\u2019s proven to be very successful that we are doing over five years you want to speed it up a little bit.  We will invest a little bit more in technology especially to make the next major move in the markets businesses which Tom and the team are driving at to get the \u2013 even with stable revenues to start to drive the profit back up again, or in treasury services business. So, the debate is, is there some amount that you\u2019d invest to help accelerate growth whether it be along the dimensions that we\u2019ve been doing and will just improve our ability to get them done and speed it up it would be modest I think, is the best way to say. Betsy Graseck : Okay, and then on the consumer business, the operating leverage has obviously been extraordinary in the last two years. Is there more to come this year? Brian Moynihan : Yes, I think, we want to focus all of you across all the business operating leverage and they tend to \u2013 they\u2019ve shown good progress at the company as a whole and each of the businesses and consumer can continually get operating leverage. They\u2019ve done a great job and you see the branches have done a hundred and some year-over-year.  The digital transactions continue to go up, but there is a lot of room to go still even though we think we\u2019ve made great progress in digital than we have only 23% of the deposits are made digitally and about 30% are made over the counter at the branches. So, as we continue to get customers to adapt these new and exciting technologies, we\u2019ll see more operating leverage, but it\u2019s been \u2013 the team has done a great job there, and I think they\u2019ll continue to improve it.  Likewise, you are going to see some of the transformation we are doing in the wealth management business continue to grow and Terry and Andy and Katy and the team are doing a great job. We need to \u2013 that business is growing, but we need to start to drive some of the digitization techniques that we use in other businesses including commercial business into that business which we\u2019ll see and that will help the operating leverage there. And then the commercial business, that\u2019s very efficient. So it\u2019s very hard fought to get much expense, but even then they\u2019ve still done a good job of taking the expense leverage through the changes and the underwriting ways we do business. This is how we underwrite centrally versus decentrally and things like that. So, it will be across the board and we expect more on the consumer. Betsy Graseck : Okay, thanks. And then just last question on the dividend payout ratio, realize that earnings up with the lower tax rate, do you expect you\u2019ll keep that dividend payout ratio flat or how are you thinking about the dividend and then overall capital return? Brian Moynihan : We may see us that we are moving toward the 30% payout ratio of earnings and I think that would mathematically follow what you just laid out the Tax - tax earnings go up it will be a higher number, so. Betsy Graseck : Thank you. Brian Moynihan : We are not quite there yet, but we\u2019re pushing towards that direction. Betsy Graseck : Okay. Thanks a lot, Brian. Operator : And we can take our next question from John McDonald with Bernstein. Your line is now open. John McDonald : Hi, good morning. Brian, thanks for the comments on expenses and how you are thinking about some of the tax impacts and maybe accelerating investments. So, I guess, kind of just coming back to that if we think about, you got to this $53 billion, you are kind of there now. Is this a level where you feel like you could run the company and you kind of have some kind of maybe just core inflation associated with the economy.  Are you still reinvesting cost saves, but you are still taking out cost some places, reinvesting other, as you think about 2019 and beyond, is $53 billion kind of where you want to be or should we think about an efficiency ratio set of goals for the next year, is that a better way to think about it? Brian Moynihan : I think the \u2013 as we said before, the key is to drive operating leverage as Betsy referenced John and continue to drive across the businesses. Couple things we\u2019ve been clear that leave aside the discussion about the investment on proceeds of taxes, but basically the $53 billion was a rate that we could kind of sustain around i.e., continuing to invest in operational improvement over time and keeping it relatively flat.  And you are dealing with inflation and things like that creep up on you. And so, we had a pretty good dynamic going and the sole question is, do you want to invest a bit to speed up and that would just increase that number by a little \u2013 by a bit and then play over the next couple of years. So the basic principle is around the company relatively flat through continuing investments and cost effectiveness is, we still got a lot of room ahead of us.  I always come back, John, and you\u2019ve followed our company closely, we have \u2013 we will continue to have the same rigor around the way we\u2019d run the company just because the tax rate is lower doesn\u2019t change how we are going to do it. So we are going to be driving that analysis that says, how much can we invest and build this operational excellence campaign we\u2019re on.  We just see tremendous opportunity to keep applying digitization to paper and the work in the company and continue to drive that. So, a lot of the \u2013 some of those investments will be branches or people or sales people and have been and the businesses, but on the other hand we are investing tremendously in the effectiveness in the company and we\u2019ll continue to do that. John McDonald : Okay, and then just for Paul, on the overdraft policy understanding the long-term franchise value of the new policy, trying to think about the near-term financial impact, is there any kind of pull through continuation or drag on deposit fees that might come from the new overdraft policy or is that impact maybe fully in the fourth quarter numbers yet? Paul Donofrio : I would say, you are going to see that next year if I were modeling that you probably want to sort of low single-digit impacts. John McDonald : Relative to... Paul Donofrio : They came in part way through the fourth quarter, so, you just had to, the good chunk is in there, John. So there will be a modest impact beyond that. John McDonald : Beyond that, okay. Thank you. Operator : And we can take our next question from Steven Chubak with Nomura Instinet. Your line is now open. Steven Chubak : Hi, good morning. So, wanted to start with a question on credit outlook. Liquidity trends remain quite favorable. Brian, you noted that NPL has declined both consumer and commercial. I am just wondering how we should be thinking about the provision outlook in the coming quarters. Is it still reasonable for us to expect that to traject in line with charge-offs and maybe some upward growth as the loan portfolio continues to season to maybe somewhere in the range of like $900 million $1 billion, is that a reasonable expectation? Paul Donofrio : We expect credit to continue to perform in line with the way it performed in the first three quarters of 2017, which we would characterize as solid, it\u2019s not excellent. We would expect provision to roughly match net charge-offs with reserve releases moderating over time as we continue to build allowance in support of loan growth, those releases are being driven by non-core consumer real estate and energy. Steven Chubak : All right, and just one clarifying question for me on the expense side. I know that that changed. You touched on this a little bit, but I just wanted to clarify the guidance that you guys have actually given on the last earnings call.  Brian, it was in the Q&A where you\u2019ve alluded to the fact that you expect expenses to be flattish in 2019. I know you are very focused on digitization, automation. I just want to confirm whether that\u2019s still a reasonable expectation just because it looks like most people are contemplating some expense ramp from 2018 to 2019. Brian Moynihan : We\u2019d say that, we\u2019d expect that all things being equal, they would be flattish and that\u2019s what we told you. The question is, we took a little bit of money and accelerate investments and kind of run through a couple of years and probably drop back off.  But it be very modest and a greater context lot of investments get capitalized with the near term P&L impacts differ but basically from a conceptual framework, we think we can run the company in the low $53 billion approximate $1 billion on a consistent basis over the next couple of years with a caveat that we may look to invest part of the tax savings on top of that and we\u2019ll be very clear when we do that. Steven Chubak : Got it. And one final one for me just regarding the remarks on the wealth management side. Brian, you talked about efforts to invest in technology to drive improved profitability. In the past you had alluded to a 30% margin target. I didn\u2019t know if that was still a reasonable expectation that you guys could get to. Brian Moynihan : Yes, I think, we are at 27 this quarter, 26, 27, - 26, we gone from that. It\u2019s a target to get to. I think it is \u2013 mechanically there is some things to help us over the next couple years in terms of some stuff running that pushes this up. So, we continue to do that. What we are talking about is a more fundamental reset on a couple of things.  Obviously, in a lower end \u2013 lower affluent business we are driving Merrill Edge and things as more efficient platform by definition. And secondly, there is a lot of paper in this business and lot of work and even advice themselves there is a lot of automation work they do that will make that easy for them do that, they could become more efficient, handle more clients and handle them well.  But if you think about the core pretax margins, it will move up and they can get it, we still believe we can get up around 30 in the deposit side helps us that as the arbitrage from rates goes through that business. Steven Chubak : Excellent. Thanks for taking my questions. Operator : And our next question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. Glenn Schorr : Hi, thank you. Hopefully, this is simple that I know you can\u2019t talk for the regulators, but all else equal have you thought through to how the Tax Act might impact the CCAR process meaning I see just a lot higher PP&R and it shouldn\u2019t impact anything else in a vacuum, but just curious if I am missing something there? Brian Moynihan : I don\u2019t think you are missing anything. This is going to be, I think all companies, all banks are going to have more \u2013 are going to keep more of what they earn. That\u2019s going to increase our profits and so, we are going to be in a better position to return more capital to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks. Glenn Schorr : But \u2013 and then just switching over to wealth management, couple little questions on like, number one is, where is all the growth coming from, meaning you noted the strong flows, curious what\u2019s current versus new clients and you also noted advises are up 3%. Is that training or is that recruiting, just curious? Paul Donofrio : Look the SA reflects really our continued investment in the training program. Some experienced hires offset by sort of the normal kind of attrition which has been very low particularly in competitive losses. Brian Moynihan : I\u2019ll just remember, just to be clear, we have changed our recruiting \u2013 we now said six months ago, where we have been recruiting sort of the traditional way. So most of the growth is coming through our advisor training platform which we consolidated between the work \u2013 the people who work in the branches and people who work in the Merrill offices brought into one day training, product training program again for effectiveness and we think that has great prospects. That will take the figures with that to play out obviously. Paul Donofrio : So, it just seem that the \u2013 about the numbers it\u2019s just AUM growth, which is being driven by market levels, it\u2019s being driven by increased flows. It\u2019s being driven by some new households and we are very focused on that. That\u2019s offset by some \u2013 little bit of spreads compression and decline in transaction revenues that we\u2019ve been seeing now for a couple peers. Glenn Schorr : Okay. Last follow-up if I could. Your decision to stay in protocol is a little different than a handful of the large peers. Just curious, the thought process and experience so far. Brian Moynihan : I\u2019ll say, it\u2019s been the experience so far has been relatively modest in terms of anything as people have been changing opinion, but, we continue to model the market and we\u2019ll figure out what we want to do, but we haven\u2019t changed our position yet. Glenn Schorr : Okay. Thank you. Operator : And we will take our next question from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Matt O'Connor : Good morning. Brian Moynihan : Hey, Matt. How are you? Matt O'Connor : Good, thank you. I was hoping to follow-up on the outlook for net interest income for the full year and you mentioned some of the drags from the card business. So I guess in the grand scheme of things, I mean, it doesn\u2019t seem like the $500 million drag from card is really that material. Obviously you had good new value growth year-over-year.  So I was trying to get a little better sense of maybe the magnitude of net \u2013 that you are looking for and then if you want to give us the bond premium amortization, how much benefit that was this year versus last might be helpful in the pieces. Paul Donofrio : Yes, look, we expect solid NII growth in 2018 from continued, sort of NIM expansion as well as loan and deposit growth. I think this dice of the increase is going to depend upon the amount of loan growth, the utilization of rates increasing along the forward curve and obviously our ability to manage the deposit rate pay.  With respect to bond premiums, what I would point out was that in 2017, we had a benefit of approximately $700 million from the lower bond amortization driven by slower prepayments as long end rates moved up at the end of the year, at the end of 2016.  So, you really can\u2019t expect that to repeat itself this year given that that curve is not linear, it\u2019s convex and we\u2019ve already had a big increase in rates and so we are not going to get the same decline in the future of prepayments fees. You noted and I would also note that 2017 included half of UK card and then you got to factor in FTE. But all that said, we feel good about 2018 NII growth, it is just going to be solid as it\u2019s going to be back to basics on loans, growing deposits, managing deposit rate paid. Matt O'Connor : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then just separately on the retail deposit side, you mentioned, essentially no repricing there. It\u2019s consistent I think with what we are seeing for low figure big peers, but just wondering what your thoughts are in terms of when they \u2013 start seeing little bit of upward pressure there and being the biggest deposit player as you might be one of the setters of the price there as we think about rates going forward. Paul Donofrio : Yes, I am not sure how helpful I am going to be to you, I would just make a couple of points that we\u2019ve made many times and that the industry really hasn\u2019t seen on the retail side deposit rates increasing sort of much or at all on traditional accounts. And I think it\u2019s important just to remind everybody that Bank of America delivers a lot of value to depositors.  You\u2019ve got transparency, convenience, safety, mobile banking, nationwide network, advising council. I think all of this plus the lack of market pressure so far has kept deposit rates relatively low. You\u2019ve seen rates rising in GUM and global banking. Look at some point rates are going to rise and my guess is we are getting close to that point given the expected fed fund rate hikes here in 2018. We just don\u2019t know though, what all I can tell you is that we are going to balance our customer needs and we are going to balance the competitive marketplace with our shareholders interest and we are going to do the right thing for all the parties. Brian Moynihan : Paul, I\u2019d just add a couple of things. One, the pricing strategy in consumer has already driven the relationships and so, as we look at pricing tiers and how we do it and set by market, set by product, set by type of customer depth and relationship, the rewards programs, the reward deposit balance along with \u2013 rates on loans and other types of things.  It\u2019s an integrated business and a lot of people focus on the one aspect of it and try to isolate it, but it\u2019s actually a very integrated business, but to give you a couple other things, what hold us down is if you look at the deposits year-over-year, and consumer up $47 billion, the checking which is always going to be very low, it was up $30 billion of the $47 billion or $29 billion of the $37 billion and CDs are down $4 billion again.  So even with the run off of CDs and so, that dynamic is always going to lead to all-in deposit price four basis points looks lower, but it\u2019s the quality of the checking franchise and core franchise we have. I think we had, the average checking balance in consumer reached $7000 this quarter. They are all prime, core transaction accounts of the household which means the pay checks coming in \u2013 that\u2019s what\u2019s driving the overall structure of the business and we\u2019ll continue to do so. Matt O'Connor : Okay, thank you very much. Operator : And we will take our next question from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Mike Mayo : Hi. What is your total technology spending, say for 2017, how that compared to 2016, where do you expect that to be for 2018? Brian Moynihan : Well, we \u2013 to be comparable, yet to understand what you are \u2013 what the components are, but the component most people focus on is what we call technology initiatives or code and new program and that\u2019s about $2.7 billion bucks and relatively flat. Mike Mayo : Relatively flat 2016, 2017, what about for 2018? Brian Moynihan : Relatively flat for 2017 and 2018. We are getting even in the way we program at a little bit efficiency as the nominal number for 2017 would be higher than that. The number for 2018 will be lower than that, but it\u2019s largely getting the same amount of work done to little less efficiency. A little less cost per dollar for programming unit for the lack of better term. So, that\u2019s been fairly cautious across time and we continue to evaluate that level of spending at all times. Mike Mayo : So, going back to Slide 12 for the consumer banking digital trends, are you spending more money in those areas as you get more traction? I mean, you see 23% mobile deposit transactions that are digital. I mean, where do you want to take that 23% number and do you need to spend more to get there? Brian Moynihan : Well, I think, when you talk about technology, the consumer bank has benefited by a lot of technology spending across the lot of dimensions including the way we distribute the environment t the branches \u2013 use of tablet type technology in the branches to integrate the customers, better call center technology. It is a tremendous investment in the consumer. On the digital side, specifically, we will travel with the customer and we were getting the customers to understand the value of \u2013instead of going to the ATM deposit, do with their phone or instead of going to branch deposit, do it with their phone, but we take it ahead of them we have to walk with them and help them do it and help them grow that 23% number up from three or four years you\u2019d see on the page like the 12%.  It was a meaningful amount that it\u2019s about a 1000 branches of activity goes through the phone. So, we will continue to drive that, but I think, yes, we have invested, but it\u2019s not necessary what we\u2019ve done for this year, it\u2019s $1 billion we probably invested in mobile technology over the last five, six years to get us here that now we are taking advantage of it and as you know it comes out the Merrill Edge capabilities continue to be improved to helping that affluent \u2013 mass affluent America.  So there is a lot of step behind it, but, so think about spending $2 billion, $2.5 billion to $3 billion in technology, think us having done that for a long time and think of some of those benefits now coming through. So it\u2019s not like the ethics are expanding to get the mobile behavior, it\u2019s actually a change in customer behavior which is less about the technology, it\u2019s more about getting the customer over the behavior. Mike Mayo : You guys have said, take a look at all of these trends collectively on Slide 12, but don\u2019t look at one in isolation. So, what sort of metric should we monitor externally to gauge your progress? Would it be, for example, the consumer banking efficiency ratio or is there one all-in compassing number or how would you suggest that we think about this? Brian Moynihan : Well, I think, the efficiency ratio and the team tell us they are going to get it, - they have done the 50 and they are going to get below 50 and they take great solace in that. I tell them, don\u2019t take great solace and that of course could be, we don\u2019t know how low it could go. But the one I think that I\u2019d argue though is that we\u2019ve always looked at the \u2013 if you look on Page 10, like the average cost of deposits.  So if you take the entirety of running this system as a percent of deposits which you can benchmark people relatively clear than the industry, you\u2019ll see that we run about a 160 basis and we set the phones, the mobiles, the technology, the people and all that stuff against the deposit base, that has come down over the last seven, eight years from 300 basis points to 161 basis points. That is a simple way for people to think of the impact of all this transformation activity and your effectiveness and efficiency in the business. Also you wouldn\u2019t want to do this if your customer scores are suffering during that timeframe, the customer scores have risen as Paul said earlier to record heights. It\u2019s that we can\u2019t get ahead of the customer and we can\u2019t push the customer due to something that we want to do and the challenge is keep that cost efficiency at 161 basis points to get the benchmark while improving customer experience. Paul Donofrio : And Mike, you got to focus on operating leverage. That\u2019s a key thing that we are looking at all the time and holding people accountable to in addition to efficiency and all the other individual metrics across mobile adoption and digital sales. Mike Mayo : My last follow-up, just on that last point Brian, a lot of investors have raised concerns that all the internet digital banking will be the demise to deposits, that deposits will flee more quickly and what\u2019s your short answer to that concern? Brian Moynihan : I think, year-over-year the consumer business grew $47 billion of organic deposit growth. I think that\u2019s what it speaks for itself, Mike. Mike Mayo : All right, thanks. Operator : And we will take our next question from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Your line is open. Ken Usdin : Thanks, good morning. I think I\u2019d follow-up on the loan side, 6% year-over-year in the core business. Pretty decent rate and you are seeing growth across, just wondering what your expectation is for loan growth are as you look out and in a bigger sense, any sense of just the movement in commercial and corporate America in terms of starting to think about investing more in their businesses? Paul Donofrio : Loan growth, we feel very good about loan growth. So, excuse me \u2013 we feel really good about loan growth. Clearly, tax reform is going to make businesses and individuals have more money in their pocket and we think that\u2019s going to stimulate economic activity. We think tax reform has made America stronger. There is new more investments here because we have leveled the playing field. So, medium, long-term, even short-term, I think we are very optimistic about loan growth.  With the slight caveat that people are repatriating some funds, so we are going to see what a factor is in the short-term on really our large corporate international kind of borrowers. On a more \u2013 at a more detail level, we feel like we\u2019ve been growing well in mortgage and we are going to \u2013 that will be offset by home equity run-off. Card has been growing well in the fourth quarter. I would note that seasonally card balance is usually down in the first quarter. Auto has been growing strongly historically. That\u2019s going to soften or has softened.  Again, I would remind everybody that we are focused on prime and super prime and we didn\u2019t follow the market out to extended durations but we are still holding our own there and expect slight modest growth next year. And on the commercial side, we\u2019ve been growing loans at mid single-digits and again, so good to, we have to repatriate funds here in the short-term. I don\u2019t see any reason to change our expectation around loan growth. Ken Usdin : Paul, is there any change in the rate of run-off in the all other bucket from that $71 billion bucket? How fast are you expecting that to still run-off? Paul Donofrio : It\u2019s been running off, the way we haven\u2019t characterized as going forward it\u2019s going to run-off sort of 5 to 6 per quarter, call it five. Ken Usdin : Okay. One quick one, just mortgage is a small line, but it had a big obvious swing, $300 million to a negative, especially that other line, can you just talk us through what that couple hundred million dollar negative was in the other part of mortgage and if that\u2019s recurring or just a one-time thing? Brian Moynihan : Yes, sure you are talking about the NBI line right? Ken Usdin : Yes. Paul Donofrio : Yes, so, we had a rep and warranty provision of approximately $200 million to resolve some claims. If you exclude that and you look quarter-over-quarter the decline in mortgage banking income that reflected lower production volume in a smaller mortgage market as well as lower servicing income as the ties of that portfolio continues to decline, keep in mind that mortgage banking income line is just simply becoming less relevant since we are now retaining 90% of our originations on the balance sheet.  And coming back to the reps and warranty of $200 million to resolve the claims, if you take a look at the litigation line this quarter it was a little lower than normal. So, we are resolving claims sometimes they show up in litigation, sometimes they show up in reps and warranty, but there is a little bit of geography there. Ken Usdin : Got it. Got it. All right, thanks a lot, Paul. Operator : And we will take our next question from Saul Martinez with UBS. Your line is open. Saul Martinez : Hi, thank you. Saul Martinez. Couple questions. Just wanted to go back, Brian to the comments on ROTCE and your ROA targets obviously with the bump from tax reform. You hit and exceed the 12% and the 1% target that you previously laid out. But as you go forward, you benefit from the lower tax rate you sort of right size your efficiency, you get to the $53 billion and drive positive operating leverage from there. Rates normalize.  It does \u2013 not to put words in your mouth, but it seems like it\u2019s pretty easy to get to sort of to the mid to high teen ROTCE and ROAs well in excess of one. But do you have a view on where you think your ROTCE can get to over the next couple of years and where ROAs can get to over the next couple of years as banks progress as you think they might? Brian Moynihan : I think that you and your question sort of stated for itself which is, yes, there will be a mathematical bump that will make it quote easy to get there at the 12 when you are running around that now. But what we are trying to say earlier is, we don\u2019t look at 12 as being, geez, let's - we've made it now we can stop.  The answer is we\u2019ll drive that number as high as we can driving responsible growth and as we start to get rid of more equity than we earn, because we have excess equity that will help, we continue to improve the earnings that will help us drive operating leverage all the things you cited will help. So, we are going to do it on a sustainable basis.  So, the point was when we talked about those targets, we are probably running about 8% or something like that. And so, we said we had to pass over a couple years to get this close to 12 and 1% ROA at the time and we\u2019ve made it there and it will be easier by tax reform. But that doesn\u2019t mean we are stopping. That\u2019s \u2013 if we just drive this company the same way and it will come out to be higher now and we will see those levels and we expect to continue to see it. Saul Martinez : Okay, fair enough. I guess, just the follow-up and it\u2019s I guess more of a \u2013 maybe a little bit more of a philosophical question. So Larry Fink, obviously as you knew, sent a letter indicating that management should look not only at maximizing profitability and return to shareholders but at the social impact of their actions and I think for good reasons you guys take pride in being a good corporate citizen.  But I am curious if you have any thoughts on that and whether you think there is a trade-off between maximizing profitability and doing good for society and other stakeholders and with the tax windfall, do you feel like maybe there is or there will be greater pressure to invest in things or to provide products or take actions that you may not have taken if tax reform has happened? Brian Moynihan : I don\u2019t think it will change the way we run the company. We\u2019ve been running it on a responsible growth with the four elements, got to grow no excuses, got it \u2013 do it with it on a customer focused organic basis, got to do it with the right risk and got to be sustainable along the best place for people to work drive share our success with communities and drive operational excellence. That format won\u2019t change. And so, what Larry wrote about and what we\u2019ve been working on for years is the idea of ESG and those types of things, and it's part of our sustainable part of our sharing our success with communities is not new for banking. I mean, it goes back to \u2013 we were, our banks, all those legacy banks that came together all were formed to help communities grow and so we had a long history investing because if we were only successful with economy and the communities we do business within are successful.  So, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a major change in our industry frankly $200 million a year share, we are getting 2 million volunteer hours, billions of dollars of building modern housing investment earnings and $1 billion plus out to the CDFIs, we can rattle off all the stuff $100 billion and half way through.  These are things we are doing long before tax reform came and we will do long before tax reform when tax reforms goes away some day or something that else changes, these are things that makes this company great and as you said, it\u2019s a philosophical viewpoint, but it\u2019s also the public role of banking system with a difference. Saul Martinez : Okay, great. Thanks a lot. Appreciate the answers. Operator : And we can take our next question from Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Your line is now open. Marty Mosby : Thank you. Wanted to drill into the expenses just a little bit to get some clarity. It seems like there was two kind of not unusual, but kind of standout $200 million worth of compensation that would have been in the first quarter now is accelerated into the fourth quarter and then, Brian, you were talking about $200 million of the charitable foundation and the extra bonus payments. Just want to make sure those were two separate items and those numbers were correct? Brian Moynihan : Marty, I think we\u2019ve got to look to it, so, given the fourth quarter and the $13.3 billion expenses, there is about a $145 million, $150 million of a one-time $1000 bonus to people under $100,000 $150,000 in our company plus we accelerate the $50 million of charitable donations in the fourth quarter 2017. That\u2019s the $200 million. That\u2019s what we are talking about, the $13.3 billion becomes $13.1 billion if you back up those two items and then did the math multiplying in times four. I think the acceleration, I think, I still in the way you talk about there as the change to FAS-123 which is that, the simple way to think is, we used to take $1 billion in the first quarter, now we take 2.50 per quarter.  It moves around little bit, but that\u2019s the phenomenon we announced earlier this quarter that we are going to \u2013 last quarter we are going to take. And so that number is in that $13.3 billion also the 2.50 for that. It\u2019s not an acceleration, it\u2019s just the way, we\u2019ve done all in one quarter and now spread across four quarters. Paul Donofrio : We made that change in the quarter, so you are seeing in the fourth quarter numbers. Brian Moynihan : And the earlier numbers when we stated, so the relative difference year-over-year is the same. Does that help Marty? Just to make sure I\u2019ve got your question. Marty Mosby : I want to make sure those were two separate items and that reconciles where I was getting to. And then, if you look at the securities portfolio, you had two things that kind of popped up, one you took at just a very modest or slight loss in security sales. And then also your AOCI, you had that OCI adjustment as rates went higher that you mentioned earlier. Will you be actively restructuring, because it does kind of drop in capital anyway and taking those losses as you have the opportunity to kind of round up earnings. So, just I was curious how aggressive you wanted to be in that \u2013 kind of in that push? Paul Donofrio : The short answer is no. We are not in any way restructuring our securities portfolio. There was a \u2013 it\u2019d be very modest, but you find there $22 million loss on some securities we sold in the fourth quarter. That was basically just some legacy stuff. We got to a nice price that affects our CCAR results and we wanted to get rid of it and we can get to the trade-offs. Brian Moynihan : It\u2019s not \u2013 it wasn\u2019t related, Marty, the core of sort of \u2013 like we invest the excess deposit proceeds in a given quarter. This was legacy stuff we are just trying to clean up. Marty Mosby : Gotcha. It just done. One of the things I was anticipating is that banks can actually accelerate the benefit as we do get uptick on the back-end of the curve, but doing some of that aggressive restructuring. So just was curious if you had been kind of thinking of that, or kind of moving in that direction? Paul Donofrio : We feel that we feel really good about where we are in terms of our securities portfolio. Brian Moynihan : And Marty, always remember the reason why we have a securities portfolio is because we have the deposit franchise. We are growing $40 billion, $50 billion year-over-year loans growth at a more modest rate especially due to run-offs. So you just have to put the money to work and we put it into an investment portfolio to extract the value that creates deposit franchise. Paul Donofrio : Yes, remember, we are only putting them in treasuries, mortgage-backed securities or cash. We have a very high quality securities portfolio. Brian Moynihan : Operator, we have another question? Operator : Certainly. We will move to the next question, it comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Your line is now open. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Hi, Brian. Brian Moynihan : Morning, Gerard. How are you? Gerard Cassidy : Good, thank you. Your fourth quarter results were good and the outlook looks quite good for you folks, as well as your peers. Can you share with us what risks you are kind of looking out for in the horizon? Obviously, again, things are looking very good for you folks and we always have to watch out from left field for some type of risk. Anything that you can identify that you guys are just keeping an eye on? Brian Moynihan : I think, Gerard, obviously, the parade of horribles that you can go through whether it be geopolitical risk, whether it\u2019s markets changing risk, whether it\u2019s credit risk, because unemployment levels rise, they are all going to come back to this economy going to keep moving along and even accelerate or decline and we don\u2019t see a lot of risk in that, but we do watch those risks.  How we avoid them is not what we are doing today. In fact, it\u2019s what we\u2019ve been doing over years to stay in that high prime quality in the consumer business, balancing the consumer versus the commercial exposure, maintaining our tough discipline in commercial credit in this situation this quarter obviously is always a wakeup call that some things don\u2019t turn out well and we got to go back and whether lessons learned and what did we do right or wrong in that and how we avoid that in future and the team has spent significant time doing that. We weren\u2019t happy with it from the top of the house through to the actual people who are involved in it, but, even with that credit cost year-over-year relatively flat and the team is doing a good job. So we think about all those risks and with cyber risk, you know the list as well as I do, but the question is how do you balance and how do you keep yourself ahead of those, so that you won\u2019t be immune from them, but they\u2019ll impact our company less. That is what we define as responsible growth quite frankly. Gerard Cassidy : Okay. Thank you. And then, you guys mentioned that your commercial customers were optimistic about the future. Can you share with us in the investment bank what the pipeline looks like at the end of the fourth quarter coming into 2018? And then second, within the investment banking division, I think you mentioned you hired 400 bankers. What sectors are you really doing well, and is it healthcare, technology, financial? Brian Moynihan : Those factors are in the commercial banking segment. So there are middle markets and\u2026 Gerard Cassidy : Okay. Brian Moynihan : Banking, just to be clear, they aren\u2019t successful, but they are across all industries. Paul, you want to talk about it? Paul Donofrio : Sure, the investment banking pipeline ended the year lower than Q3 mainly due to the completion of some large transactions in Q4 combined with the postponement of or cancelation of some other large transactions. Having said that, again, I think we are very optimistic about 2018 given the Tax Act which, again, has leveled the playing field here.  And we think companies are going to be interested in more M&A transactions and ultimately are going to be investing in raising capital. So, down a little bit, but that\u2019s kind of normal for clean up at the year-end. Your other question regarding sectors, we are number three globally and when you look at across all of our industry groups, we are plus and minus around that range pretty consistently, obviously, you have couple of groups that are doing than others, but we feel like there are no weak spots in investment banking and all the groups are very strong. Brian Moynihan : Gerard, one thing, I thought you are going to go through was \u2013 what the consumers feel. It was interesting that the spending into the full year of 2017 whether it\u2019s credit cards, debit cards, ACH, wires, payment of bills, cash out ATMs over-the-teller line, checks written. Whether it\u2019s 6% growth over 2016 and 2016 to 2015 was a little under 3%.  So the consumers are feeling pretty good in spending very strongly out there and it is broad as in just the credit and debit card spending. That is up 6%,7% as Paul had said earlier but it\u2019s the broader use of cash which shows that consumers are putting money out there spending on things. So we feel good about the consumer side and the month of December was faster than the year in terms of being growth with 7% versus 6%. Gerard Cassidy : That\u2019s a real good insight. And then just lastly, I think you talked getting the dividend payout ratio to 30% and I recognize this is a Board of Directors\u2019 decision. If the regulators give the green light to the SIFI banks, that 40% dividend payout ratios are okay, philosophically, how do you think about that if - again, the green light is given by the regulators? Brian Moynihan : I think we\u2019ll have to think about that when we get there. I am not sure for us barriers of largest banks are not going to always be a little more circumspect or whatever the right way would it be in terms of governing our dividend. They just don\u2019t want us to ever have to cut our dividends and as you do look at it mathematically across time periods, the idea of us not earning 70% of our earnings therefore, i.e. being able to pay for the dividend at a very low probability and that\u2019s where they came up with that number and I think let\u2019s just be, it will see play out, I don\u2019t know what they\u2019ll do, but our strategy inside the company is continue to move up the dividend on a rational basis along with the earnings to get closer to that number. Gerard Cassidy : Great. Appreciate it, thank you again. Brian Moynihan : Thanks. Operator : And our next question comes from Vivek Juneja with JP Morgan. Your line is open. Vivek Juneja : Hi, thanks. Couple of questions for you folks. Paul, you mentioned that NII, you gave some puts and takes, let\u2019s not tie them all together and say net-net do you \u2013 I mean recognize the day count issue in Q1, would you expect some growth going from Q4 to Q1 given the December rate hike even adjusting for the day count? Paul Donofrio : I think it\u2019s too early to give you that sort of guidance. I\u2019ve given everything that I want to give you at this point. Again, we got two fewer days. We\u2019ve got the card loans which using a little bit lower. If we get rid of the FTE I don\u2019t know how you look at it and remember that at the end of Q4, there was a run up in the LIBOR anticipation of the rate increases.  So, we got some of that benefit in Q4. It\u2019s really just going to depend on loan and deposit growth and what happens on deposit pricing, that\u2019s what I am not really willing to telling you higher or lower because, I just don\u2019t know how deposit pricing is going to play out over the quarter. Vivek Juneja : Okay, okay, thanks on that one. Brian, a question for you. One of your peers set a goal of 2% of net income for corporate philanthropy, are you thinking of resetting anything like that? Brian Moynihan : We have what you call as pure charity. We have kept our levels consistent from before the crisis now about $175 million, $200 million a year and we\u2019ll expect to keep it there. In addition to that we did tremendous volunteer work, 1 million hours a year and other things. We feel comfortable with that level. I\u2019d say, haven't even done the math lately, but I think that\u2019s 1% after tax at this point. But our view is that, we can have a lot of impact there with ebbs and flows depending on what\u2019s going on at the moment, but I don\u2019t expect us to change that dramatically. Vivek Juneja : Okay. Thank you. Operator : And we will take our final question from Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Your line is open. Brian Kleinhanzl : Thanks. Yes, I know you don't want to give any commentary about deposit betas in the quarter and that, but what's the ability that you have to remix and as sales there was up to 125%. So, to the extent that you want to get as competitive on deposit rates, I mean there is still plenty of opportunity to remix from short-term into loans? Paul Donofrio : On deposits, just, it\u2019s a very sophisticated question of how you price. We price literally by every market, by every product, by every customer sets. And so, as Paul mentioned earlier, in the Wealth Management business, we moved pricing up because people with $10 million in investment assets whether it\u2019s obviously check the cash in their accounts as an investment as it is opposed to in the retail business it be there will daily flow.  So, it\u2019s a very sophisticated question and you are seeing us work that question across time and you saw us raise rates in Wealth Management business, Consumer business raised rates albeit it\u2019s smaller. The corporate business respond more instantaneously, it\u2019s a methodology for paying for services. And so, it\u2019s a very complex thing. So it\u2019s hard to sort of give you a single answer and when we model we use a number, but frankly we\u2019ve done better than that model every single quarter, so - but we have to be conservative in our modeling for NII and other purposes. Brian Kleinhanzl : Okay, and then just maybe just one follow-up on the expenses in the 2019. I mean, is there a big opportunity to do investments? I know you said you give further details later on as you look across, maybe pull forward some investments and lower expenses, but it seems like, if you were to go and some kind of accelerated investment, maybe there will be a chance to get below that $53 billion in expenses in 2019 and is that\u2019s still possibly something you're actively pursuing? Brian Moynihan : What we told you guys is we got to $53 billion for 2018 be relatively flat thereon absorbing 6% medical care cost increases raises and things like that and that comes through ability to continue to investment effectiveness and efficiency. So, we don\u2019t \u2013that\u2019s an operating strategy level and exact number that we are focused on and we continue to focus on that. So I don\u2019t \u2013 there is no change to that. The question would be, do you want to accelerate some investments given the higher after tax yield. And we will look at, as I said and we\u2019ll look at across time, you have to be able to get the value of those investments. We\u2019ve been \u2013 one of the caller\u2019s questions reference a little bit earlier, we added 400 commercial bankers.  We have to make sure, if we added 400 more tomorrow, you might not be able to get to speed. So you have to make sure they are coming in and we use techniques to divide the portfolio to give them deeper client penetration to get the customers for the products for customers. That takes time and you just can\u2019t snap your finger.  So, the ability to accelerate those investments are largely based on what we think we can do that will be modest in a sense that, even a step of fair increase and the margin is not a big number in the overall scheme of things at the $53 billion expense level. At the end of the day, our challenge is to drive operating leverage and we continue to do that within 12 quarters in a row and we\u2019ll continue to do that going forward and that\u2019s good for shareholders.

For further information on those, please refer to either our earnings release documents, our website, or our SEC filings. Brian Moynihan, our Chairman and CEO will make some opening comments. Paul Donofrio, our CFO will review the 1Q results in more detail. With that then - after that we\u2019ll open up for questions. With that, I\u2019ll pass it over to Brian. Brian Moynihan : Thank you, Lee, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to review our first quarter results. The momentum our team has build over the last several years again showed up the strong earnings in the first quarter 2018. So let me start on Slide 2. We reported record earnings for our company of $6.9 billion after-tax, up 30%. On a pre-tax basis, our earnings grew 15%. This growth drove improvements in our returns. Return on tangible common equity improved nearly 400 basis points to 15.3%, while our return on assets improved to 120 basis points. Our efficiency ratio fell below 60% on an FTE basis, reflecting our disciplined focus on expenses. We achieved dollars by driving responsible growth. As you\u2019ve heard us say many times, responsible growth has four parts. We have to grow no excuses, we have to grow on our customer-focused framework, we have to grow within our risk appetite, and we have to do it in a sustainable manner. So how did we do this quarter? Well, first of all, we did grow no excuses. During the first quarter, we continue to play the role that our company plays and help economies grow here and around the world by supplying capital into debt and equity growth for under - equities for underwriting - equity underwriting for growth of those companies. In our company, we grew loans by more than 5% year-over-year in aggregate across the businesses. We grew deposit by more than 3%, while maintaining discipline in our deposit pricing. Consumer led our deposit growth with an increase of 6%, or $38 billion in deposits year-over-year, a strong showing. All this led to revenue growth of 4%, and we also increased the amount of capital we returned to shareholders this quarter. We grew within our defined customer framework, the second tenet of responsible growth. As Paul will show you later in the presentation, we delivered more cards and more checking accounts to our consumer customers, more accounts in our Merrill Edge online brokerage to our investors, more households were formed in Merrill Lynch in U.S. Trust and more small business clients, more business banking clients, and more of commercial banking customers came into the franchise. But most importantly, with those customers are already here, we continue to increase our depth of relationship. The third tenet of responsible growth is to grow within our disciplined risk framework. We reported credit charge-offs of $911 million, 40 basis points of average loans, lower than both the prior quarter and the prior year ago quarter. In fact, we reported a net charge-off ratio below 50 basis points now for 13 of the last 16 quarters, that\u2019s four years of relative consistency. And just like last year for the whole of 2017, we made money everyday in the first quarter in the Global Markets business despite the pickup and volatility. And while our markets balance sheet grew to support our clients, our value of risk remain stable year-over-year. The fourth tenet of responsible growth has grown on a sustainable basis, and we did that by investing in our people and our communities and by driving operational excellence. You can see that comes through once again with the predictable earnings for our shareholders. This quarter\u2019s results are the 13th quarter in a row, reporting positive operating leverage in our year-over-year basis. As you look at Slide 3, you can see this chart. We got there different ways in different quarters with 13 quarters in a row of positive operating leverage. That\u2019s because through fundamental operational excellence and expense discipline throughout our franchise. We\u2019ve been able to again reduce quarterly operating expenses this quarter on a year-over-year basis. We\u2019ve done that now for 13 of the past 14 quarters even as we continue to invest heavily in a franchise. These investments in our franchise range from investments in the communities we serve, the products we deliver and the people who serve our clients. As we said before, we continue to invest nearly $3 billion annually in technology initiatives. Investments in the business this quarter have come through the new capabilities for our clients. We included the roll out of Erica across the Board, our artificial intelligence systems and mobile banking. We had a more extensive roll out of our digital auto shopping across the country and we initiated our digital mortgage capabilities. In addition, we continue to drive our P2P payment product Zelle throughout our franchise. Paul will take you through the slides and focus on these items and the statistics around this growth. But it\u2019s important to realize the emerging growth that these items represent. In addition to that, we continue to build on years of our retail transformation investments. This quarter, we highlighted over the next four years, we\u2019ll open 500 new centers and redesign more than 1,500 centers completing the task that we\u2019ve been after for many years. This will require us to add 5,000 new client-facing professionals opening 600 Merrill Edge offices and expanding the financial center footprint. We\u2019re expanding those to markets, where we traditionally have had commercial wealth management businesses and now we\u2019ll have a full franchise. As you think about people in our investment - in our teammates, year-over-year, we\u2019ve added 1,500 primary relationship teammates. At the same time, we\u2019ve reduced our overall headcount by 2,600, or about little over 1% of headcount. We also shared some success of our company from tax reform with all our teammates their bonuses and share grants and all 90%-plus of our teammates have received benefits. We continue to invest in our industry-leading aspects of our teammates included in our minimum starting wage, our extended bereavement and parental leave policies and many other items. In summary, this is a record quarter and we did it by driving responsible growth. With that, let me turn it over to Paul to take you through more details. Paul? Paul Donofrio : Thanks, Brian. Good morning, everyone. I\u2019m going to start on Slide 4. Bank of America reported net income of $6.9 billion, or $0.62 per diluted share. Net income was up 30% year-over-year. EPS was up 38%. Growth in earnings was driven by not only tax reform, but also operating leverage and continued strong asset quality, which is easily seen in our $8.4 billion pre-tax income, which was up 15% year-over-year. Revenue was $23.1 billion, improving 4% year-over-year, driven by NII improvement. Expenses fell 1%, creating operating leverage of 5%. Provision expense was $834 million, virtually the same number as last year. With respect to returns, return on comp climbed to 10.8%. Return on tangible common equity, which tends to be a more widely followed by BAC investors grew to 15.3%. Return on assets was 1.2%, and on an FTE basis, the efficiency ratio improved to just below 60%. All these metrics showed strong improvement from 2017. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 18%, reflecting the roughly 900 basis points of ongoing benefit, resulting from tax reform. Note the Q1 ne included a tax benefit of approximately $200 million from deductions for share-based awards delivered during the quarter. If one adjusts for this, the effective tax rate would have been a little more than 20% in line with expectations on a full-year basis. Before moving on, I would also note that the quarter included a few accounting rule changes, as well as reporting changes. None of these were material and they\u2019re described more fully in our appendix of our press release and earnings deck. Turning to the balance sheet on Slide 5. Overall, compared to the end of Q4 end of period assets of $2.3 trillion increased $47 billion, driven by growth to support Global Markets clients, as well as higher cash balances from strong deposit growth. We expect a portion of the cash billed to reverse as customers pay taxes in Q2. Loans on a period end basis declined $2.7 billion, as consumers began paying down credit card balances, following a period of strong holiday spend in Q4. We also moved roughly $2 billion of consumer loans to held-for-sale. On the funding side, we grew deposits $19 billion from Q4 and we added market-based funding in support of asset growth in Global Markets. Long-term debt increased $4.9 billion from year-end as we took advantage of attractive spreads ahead of 2Q maturities. Liquidity remain strong with average global equity sources of $522 billion and liquidity coverage ratio of 124%. Equity decreased a little more than $900 million from Q4. Common equity declined $3.3 billion, while preferred equity increased $2.3 billion from a late period issuance, the preferred issuance replaces redemptions that will be completed in Q2. The decline in common equity from Q4 was driven by negative OCI, common dividends and share buybacks, which in total exceeded the $6.9 billion of earnings. The OCI decrease was driven by a $4 billion after-tax decline in the recorded value of our asset securities, given the increase in long-end rates in Q1. Share repurchases and common dividends in the quarter were $6.1 billion. In Q1, we repurchased 152 million shares and issued 41 million shares under our employee incentive programs. From a book value per share perspective, the decline and common equity was mostly offset by our declining share count, resulting in a tangible book value per share of $16.84, down modestly from Q4. As we turn to regulatory metrics, let me remind you, we are now through the transition period on CET1 and reporting on a fully phased-in basis. Our CET1 ratios remained well above our 9.5% requirement, but did decline in the quarter, given the reduction in common equity I just reviewed. In essence, we returned most of our net income through capital distributions, so the equity reduction roughly equaled the OCI loss on AFS securities. Focusing on risk-weighted assets and compared to Q4, RWA under advanced was stable. Under standardized, it increased $9 billion. Global market activity drove the increase under both approaches, but the increase was offset under advanced by declines in consumer credit and continued roll off of legacy mortgages. Looking at CET1 ratios under advanced declined 24 basis points to 11.3%. Under standardized, the ratio declined 33 basis points to 11.4%. The ratios within 4 basis points of each other as there is now only $6 billion in RWA separating the two approaches. The supplemental leverage ratio declined modestly from balance sheet growth, but continued to well exceed regulatory minimums. Turning to Slide 6. On an average basis, total loans increased to $932 billion. Note that the Q2 2017 sale of UK card and the Q4 2017 sale of remaining small positions of student loans and manufactured housing loans impacted the year-over-year comparisons by a little more than $10 billion. Adjusting for these sales, which were recorded in all other, average loans were up $28 billion, or 3% year-over-year. Loan growth continue to be dampened by the run-off of non-core loans, on the other hand, loans in our business segments were up $45 billion, or 5.5% year-over-year. Consumer Banking grew 8%, led by mortgages in credit card. Wealth management strong growth of 7% was driven by mortgages and structured lending. Originations of new home equity loans continued to be outpaced by pay downs. Global Banking loans and leases were up 3%. Loan growth remained solid, but with the Middle East slower year-over-year growth in previous quarters. Switching to average deposits and looking at the bottom right, growth was $41 billion, or 3% year-over-year. Consumer Banking once again led with growth of $39 billion, or 6%. Year-over-year average deposit declined in wealth management. This year-over-year decline mostly occurred from Q1 2017 to Q2 2017. Since then, deposit levels in wealth management have been stable. Global Banking deposits increased $19 billion, or 6%, as we grew client balances domestically across all sectors of commercial clients and internationally with corporate clients. Turning to asset quality on Slide 7. Total net charge-offs were $911 million, or 40 basis points of average loans. As Brian mentioned, aside from the Q4 single-name commercial loss, our net charge-offs and resulting loss ratio have been quite consistent. Provision expense of $834 million in Q1 included a $77 million net reserve release. This reflects our focus on responsible growth, as well as an improving economy. The net reserve release reflects continued improvement in our legacy commercial real estate and energy portfolios with a modest build for continued credit card seasoning. Our reserve coverage remained strong with an allowance loan ratio of 1.1% and a coverage level 2.8 times our annual net charge-offs for the quarter. On Slide 8, we break our credit quality metrics of both our consumer and commercial portfolios with respect to consumer, net charge-offs of $830 million, or up $61 million from Q4. The primary driver of the increase is the seasoning of the consumer credit card portfolios as net charge-off ratio increased to 3%. Consumer NPLs of $4.9 billion declined from Q4, and 45% of our consumer NPLs remain current on their payments. Commercial losses continue to bounce along the bottom declining from Q4 and on a year-over-year basis. Finally, reservable criticized exposure was down nearly $200 million from Q4. Turning to Slide 9. Net interest income on a GAAP non-FTE basis was $11.61 billion - $11.71 billion on an FTE basis. Year-over-year, GAAP NII is up $550 million, or 5%, reflecting the benefits of both higher interest rates, as well as long deposit growth, partially offsetting this growth was the absence of NII resulting from 2Q 2017 sale of the UK consumer credit card business and higher funding costs for Global Markets. Focusing on net interest yield, it is flat year-over-year as the benefits of broad improvement in asset yields versus funding costs was offset by two notable factors : First, the Q2 2017 sale of higher yielding UK car portfolio; and second, the impact from the lower yielding Global Markets assets. Together, these two factors lowered notices deal by 12 basis points year-over-year. Compared to Q4 2017, NII on a GAAP basis improved $146 million, as the net benefits of higher interest rates across the curve offset two less interest accrual days. NII on an FTE basis and in comparison to prior periods was further impacted by tax reform, which lowered NII on an FTE basis by roughly $100 million. With respect to deposit pricing, overall interest bearing deposit rate paid in Q1 rose 4 basis points from Q4 2017 and 21 basis points year-over-year. That compares to Fed funds, which is up 75 basis points over the past 12 months. In the most recent quarter, we increased rates on certain wealth management deposits to keep pace with market-based alternatives. With respect to commercial clients, we continue to selectively raise pricing. Pricing on retail interest bearing deposits was unchanged. During the asset sensitivity as of 3/31 and instantaneous 100 basis point parallel increase in rates is estimated to increase NII by $3 billion over the subsequent 12 months. This is modestly lower than 12/31 sensitivity, driven by the increase in long-end rates, which decreased prepayments and increased NII. The short insensitivity was largely unchanged from year-end and now represents about 75% of the sensitivity. Turning to Slide 10, we had another solid quarter of expense management, extending our record of year-over-year quality declines in expense to 13 out of the last 14 quarters. Noninterest expense of $13.9 billion this quarter was down $196 million, or 1.4% year-over-year. Improvements in non-personnel costs drove the year-over-year decline. Personnel costs were relatively flat year-over-year, despite increasing salaries for merit and increased healthcare costs. We continue to reduce non-client-facing roles, while increasing client-facing roles such as relationship bankers in consumer, business banking and commercial, as well as financial advisers in wealth management. As we signaled on our 4Q call, expenses increased compared to Q4 2017. The increase of $622 million was driven by seasonal elevation of payroll tax expense and higher expenses associated with revenue, mostly in Global Markets, but also in wealth management modestly offsetting these increases or operational cost reductions. This quarter marks the first quarter we have reported efficiency ratio below 60% on an FTE basis. Turning to the business segments starting with consumer on Slide 11. Another very strong quarter for this business, as the value of deposits, growth of both loans and deposits as well as the investments we have made in people and our ability to better connect with customers continue to improve financial results. Consumer Banking\u2019s earnings increased to $2.7 billion in Q1, returning 30% on allocated capital. Given tax reform, a review of pre-tax growth is more relevant and on this basis, profit grew 19% year-over-year. By the way, this is the 11th straight quarter for Consumer Banking\u2019s earnings rose on a year-over-year basis. Consumer Banking traded over 700 basis points of operating leverage in Q1, as revenue growth of 9% outpaced expense growth of 2%. The efficiency ratio fell below 50%. The value of our deposits as rates rose along with growth in client balances drove the 9% year-over-year improvement in revenue. The over year average loans grew 8%, average deposits grew 6%, and Merrill Edge brokerage assets grew 18%. Cost of deposits, which reflects noninterest expense as a percent of average deposits remained steady at 161 basis points. Rates paid remained very low at just less than 5 basis points. Year-over-year net charge-offs increased $105 million, as we continue to experience modest and expected seasoning of our credit card portfolio along with loan growth. The net charge-off ratio remained low at 1.27%, and is up only 6 basis points year-over-year. Provision expense increased $97 million year-over-year. Okay, turning to Slide 12, and key trends. Looking first at revenue, driven by NII growth, revenue grew 9% year-over-year, reflecting the value of our deposits and our relationships with customers, which continue to deepen as we expand capabilities. Spending on debit and credit cards was up 9% year-over-year. That\u2019s up from 5% growth in Q1 2017, indicating relationship deepening and consumer confidence have continued to improve. This increased spending was enough to drive a small increase in card income, despite the headwinds from increased customer rewards. Service charges were down modestly as a result of the full quarter impact of the elimination of certain overdraft fees late in Q4. Focusing on client balances on the bottom of the page, you can see the success we continue to have growing deposits, loans and brokerage assets. It\u2019s worth noting Merrill Edge assets have grown to $182 billion, up 18% year-over-year. Client flows here marked a new record this quarter up 36% from the previous record. Merrill Edge offers customers a lot of value and it\u2019s a great way for us to deepen relationships. Whether it is access to one of our 4,000 licensed advisers and to world-leading research platform or how we integrate Merrill Edge into other banking needs, we think customers are noticing and giving us more of their investment dollars. Also note worthy is card balances, which grew 5% year-over-year, our focus remains on prime and super prime borrowers, which averaged book FICO scores of 770. Expenses are up 2% year-over-year as investment in renovating branches and technology initiatives modestly outpaced continued optimization and savings from digitalization, and we continue to make progress on our announced investments in new and renovating financial centers, including entry into new markets. Slide 13 shows the progress in digital banking. We had some significant events this quarter. First, we introduced Erica, our digital banking assistant to customers. While it\u2019s too early to judge the usage, this is an exciting deployment, which offers customers the use of cognitive AI learning to help them better live their financial lives. We also rolled out digital auto shopping more fully across the U.S. In Q1, 67,000 customers utilized our auto shopping app, which was twice as many as Q4. Overall, auto loan stores digitally accounted for 50% of all auto loans originated directly with our customers. We also rolled out our digital mortgage experience accelerating the simplified mortgage applications to benefits like pre-filling customer data, digital loading of supporting documents and utilizing DocuSign. Turning to some of the digital trends on the slide. As you can see year-over-year, growth in all these metrics continued to be impressive as we remain a leader in digital banking. We now have more than 35 million digital users, including 25 million accessing their accounts through mobile devices. This quarter customers logged into the Bank of America mobile banking app 1.4 billion times to either transact or shop with us. Digital payments grew to $365 billion this quarter well surpassing 50% of total payments of $682 billion, which were up 10% year-over-year. P2P payments, while a small percentage of overall payments continued to increase with $9 billion of payments processed in Q1. Also noteworthy is the volume of mobile deposit transactions, which now represents 24% of all deposit transactions. This is equal to volume of more than 1,200 financial centers. Appointments made through digital devices to meet with a professional in one of our financial centers also continues to grow reaching nearly 35,000 a week. This allows us to not only better understand and prepare for customer needs, but also to better manage our professional staffing within our busy financial centers. Sales and digital devices now account for 26% of all sales. Turning to record results in our Global Wealth and Investment Management business on Slide 14. Strong client activity, a market, which was up year-over-year, higher rates and solid expense management pushed GWIM\u2019s earnings this quarter to over $1 billion for the first time ever. Pre-tax earnings grew 12% and pre-tax margin increased to 29%. Strong AUM flows over the past 12 months and a tailwind with respect to market appreciation once again drove strong asset management fees offsetting modest pricing pressure. At the same time, brokers revenue continued to face headwinds as volume declined and mix shifted. All in, revenue grew 6% year-over-year, with 17% growth in asset management fees and modest NII improvement, partially offset by lower brokerage revenue. Revenue growth coupled with careful expense management drove 3% operating leverage. Year-over-year expenses were up 3%, driven by revenue-related incentives, as well as investments in primary sales professionals. While we were pleased with revenue this quarter, I would note that the market levels at fee pricing points were quite healthy this quarter and have since retreated. Moving to Slide 15. We continued to see strong overall client engagement in Merrill Lynch and U.S. Trust. Our local market strategy, led by 93 market presidents, is helping to better integrate our lines of business and deepen relationships, especially in wealth management. We\u2019re also seeing Merrill Lynch advisers react positively to growth initiatives in this business, including the 2018 compensation program, which incentivizes household and other types of responsible organic growth. Total organic household acquisition for the quarter was the highest we\u2019ve experienced in quite sometime, five years, at least. Q1 was also a strongest start of the year since the merger with Merrill in terms of total net new money. In fact, we saw positive brokerage flows for the first time in a couple of years, all while experiencing record low competitive adviser attrition. Year-over-year client balances rose $140 billion, or 5% to $2.7 trillion, driven by higher market values, solid AUM flows and continued loan growth. Average loans of $159 billion grew 7% year-over-year and the growth remained concentrated in consumer real estate, as well as structured lending. Turing to Slide 16, Global Banking earned just over $2 billion, generating the 20% return on allocated capital. With solid expense controls, this business remains the efficiency leader of the company at 44%. On a pre-tax basis, earnings declined 2% year-over-year, driven by lower investment banking fees and revenue impacts on an FTE basis of tax reform with respect to tax advantage assets. Absent the impact of tax reform, the business would have created modest operating leverage. With respect to revenue, IB fees were down in line with a reduction in the industry\u2019s IB fee pool, reflecting the tough comparison against a strong Q1 2017 IB fees of $1.35 billion for the overall company declined 15% year-over-year. Expenses reflect operational savings mostly offset in our investment in additional client-facing professionals to enhance local market coverage. Global Banking grew loans 3% year-over-year to a record $352 billion. As I said last quarter, optimism amongst client remains high. So we continue to expect loan demand to pick up. Looking at trends on Slide 17 and comparing to Q1 last year. With respect to average loans, the 3% growth was led by international regions and domestic middle market C&I. Within total commercial lending, average C&I rose 3%, while commercial real estate increased 2%. Loan spreads were flat in Q1 continuing the trend we have seen in the past six months after early 2017 compression. Average deposits rose 19%, or 6% year-over-year, as we maintained a targeted pricing approach to acquire and retain high-quality deposits. Switching to Global Markets on Slide 18 and 19. I will talk about results, excluding DVA. Global Markets revenue was $4.7 billion and earnings increased to $1.4 billion, returning 16% on allocated capital. On a pre-tax basis, earnings were down modestly year-over-year, driven by lower revenue and increased expenses from continued technology investments, up 1% year-over-year, sales and trading totaled $4.1 - of the $4.7 billion in revenue. Performance in equities was strong as volatility increased. Equity sales and trading revenue at $1.5 billion reached the record, up 38% year-over-year. Results were driven by increased client activity and a strong trading performance in derivatives. The equity business also benefited from an increase in client financing activities. Revenue in fixed sales and trading at $2.5 billion increased 13%, driven by lower client activity and less favorable credit markets compared to a very robust prior year quarter. This overshadowed improvement in macro products such as rates and currency. With respect to expenses, Q1 was 2% higher year-over-year, driven by continued investments in technology. Okay, on Slide 20, we show all other, which reported a net loss of $286 million, which was an improvement year-over-year. Revenue declined $240 million year-over-year, primarily due to the absence of the non-U.S. consumer credit card business sold in 2Q 2017. Noninterest expense improved approximately $500 million year-over-year, due to lower mortgage servicing costs, reduced operational costs from the sale of the non-U.S. consumer credit card business and lower litigation expenses. Compared to Q4 2017, remember, the changes related to tax reform were booked in this reporting unit impacting significantly quarter-over-quarter comparisons of revenue and tax expense. Okay. Let me turn it back over to Brian for a couple of closing comments before we open it up for Q&A. Brian Moynihan : Thanks, Paul, and we\u2019re on Slide 21, just a couple of thoughts to close and take your questions. We\u2019re operating in an environment with global economics expansion continues and it continued in the first quarter. The corporate profits have remained healthy. Consumer and business confidence is - continues to be strong, and we see that in accelerated consumer spending in our customer base as Paul talked about. The financing balances grew middle - in our markets business, as our investors invested heavily in the markets in the first quarter. So that\u2019s a good business environment, a solid business environment with good economic metrics and we continue to get our fair share in that environment. We did it by driving responsible growth and the operating leverage that we talked about through all the businesses, and we also provided more capital back to you our shareholders. With that, let\u2019s open it up for questions-and-answers. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take our first question from John McDonald of Bernstein. John McDonald : Hi, good morning. Brian Moynihan : Good morning. John McDonald : In terms of expenses, Paul and Brian, you\u2019ve - you\u2019re on track clearly to get to your target of the ballpark $53 billion for this year. I think, you said that you can also kind of stay in that ballpark in 2019 and 2020 even with the investments and the build-outs that you\u2019re doing. Is that still the view and how is that possible? Are you self-funding that with some saves elsewhere? If you could talk about, that would be helpful? Thanks. Brian Moynihan : Yes. John, it\u2019s our view - what we said, I think, the last quarter was the investments we\u2019ll make are - will be funded with the hard work in operating leverage and simplify and improve in organizational health and operational excellence. And we\u2019ve - we announced the investments we\u2019re making in the retail business and it\u2019s all contemplated with in the $53 billion - in the low $53 billion level, which we ought to be able to maintain in 1920. And if we\u2019re going to make any further investments, we\u2019ll be modest as we said. But right now, it looks like it\u2019s shaking out to be okay. John McDonald : Okay, great. And then also on the credit cards, it looks like you\u2019re getting solid card growth now and balances of 5% year-over-year. Is that some acceleration in new products that you\u2019ve rolled out within the last year or so? And do you think that growth can continue on the credit card front? And then just as an add-on, in terms of the seasoning, Paul, do you have any kind of view of what the pace of that 3% charge-off would look like as it seasons? Thanks. Paul Donofrio : Sure. Let me start with the latter. So we did have a charge-off rate of 2% this quarter, that was expected and well within tolerance. We would expect it to be around 3% kind of if you look at the remainder of the year, remember, Q2 is usually seasonally the highest quarter in terms of credit card net charge-off. Plus I would remind you that, we have the hurricanes, which is now 180 days since the suspension of those charge-offs probably a little bit. That would show up in second quarter, but we\u2019ll fully reserve for that. So then you get the rest of the year, which is seasonally down normally. So I would expect it to be around 3% on average for the full remainder of the year. In terms of growth, it\u2019s just good blocking and tackling. We remain focused on prime and super prime, where our customers are adding cards, using our cards more because of the reward structure to make it simple form. We make it easy, and I think - I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything different. We\u2019re doing, it\u2019s just a continuation of what we\u2019ve been doing in the past. Brian Moynihan : I\u2019d add one thing, John, people forget that we also got out of - been sold a lot of businesses pieces and card over the years, including another one that will go out over the next quarter or so. And that always was hard to go through. That\u2019s kind of over now by and large. And so the growth we\u2019re seeing in the underlying million plus cards - new cards we do every quarter and the usage by the customers and primary usage has been pretty consistent and ought to bode well for continued growth. But it\u2019s really getting a rid of the drag of - getting rid of portfolios over the last couple of years. John McDonald : Okay. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll move next to Betsy Graseck - I\u2019m sorry, Jim Mitchell of Buckingham Research. Your line is open. James Mitchell : Oh, good morning. Maybe just a quick question on deposit pricing you guys have in your - in the retail side have kept deposit pricing quite low. Obviously, you\u2019ve done a great job and focusing on small balances transaction relationship type accounts. When do you think that pressure starts to build in your business sources, because there\u2019s - their transaction you just don\u2019t think there\u2019s a lot of pressure for your pricing retail deposits right now? Paul Donofrio : Look, Bank of America and the industry, I think, have not increased deposit pricing appreciably on traditional accounts. I think the reason for that is, certainly, in Bank of America\u2019s case, we deliver a lot of value to depositors, transparency, convenience, safety, mobile banking, online banking, we\u2019re rolling out new capabilities every day with Erica, nationwide network, rewards, advice and counsel that has real value to people beyond just the deposit rate paid. And I think this value plus the lack of market pressure so far has allowed us to keep deposit rates relatively flat in traditional accounts. You\u2019ve seen us been raising it in GUM. You\u2019ve seen us been raising it selectively in Global Banking. We\u2019re just going to have to balance. We\u2019re going to continue to balance the needs of our customers in the competitive market environment with that of our shareholders\u2019 interests and we\u2019ll do the right thing at the right moment. Brian Moynihan : Hey, Jim, just adding that, people get focused on the rate. So, as a clear statement, the all-in rate paid for all our deposits about 24 basis points, obviously, extremely beneficial versus any other way to raise money in the markets, which are multiples of that. In fact, I think, we paid three times as much for our term debt costs on a quarterly basis in all of the deposits. But people forget that, that comes from the value of the customer franchise. And so if you think about the consumer business, half of their deposits are checking. And so and the CD\u2019s have been running up and sort of bouncing around the $2 billion or $3 billion of runoff on a year-over-year basis. So it is driven by the fact that the core transaction account, the balance has grown over $7,000 per balance of checking accounts in the consumer franchise. And as we add more accounts and grow in these new markets, we\u2019re getting the primary relationship in the household, which means you\u2019re getting the transaction money, which is moving at all times. And so it\u2019s a different format. It\u2019s not a pricing strategy, it\u2019s actually comes out of the fact that that\u2019s the nature of the business. James Mitchell : Right, and you\u2019re still getting good growth, so it\u2019s a good thing. Has the - if you look at the short end of the curve here, your rate sensitivity numbers at the short end really don\u2019t seem to have changed over the past year, despite multiple rate hikes. Is that sort of reflective of that experience that the type of deposit you\u2019re attracting are lower rates and maybe you initially thought and you have a little bit more sensitivity at the short end even after number rate actually seen? Paul Donofrio : That\u2019s right. Brian Moynihan : Yes, that\u2019s generally right. James Mitchell : Okay, great. Thanks a lot. Operator : We\u2019ll move next to Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good morning. Brian Moynihan : Good morning. Betsy Graseck : A couple of questions. One on capital that you indicated very strong capital ratios across the Board. Could you just give us a sense of post to the Fed discussion and proposals on the SLR and the SCB? How you might be able to, at least, go through as proposed, how you might be able to utilize them? Paul Donofrio : Utilize the capital? Betsy Graseck : Yes, does it free any incremental opportunity set for you? Paul Donofrio : Yes. Okay. Well, a couple of thoughts. Obviously, it\u2019s still early, I think, it\u2019s only now a couple of days. I guess, the first thing I would say, I think, we think it\u2019s constructive, right, growing the balance sheet and increasing buybacks or continuing buybacks and stressfully to make a lot of sense. So that kind of change is going to model reality or better model reality, I should say, replacing a fixed capital conservation buffer with a buffer that\u2019s more tailored to companies individual situation that seems sensible. The issue is that you\u2019ve got CCAR stress in there that can fluctuate year-over-year. So the question is, maybe hopefully this year\u2019s scenario, it\u2019s a lot more severe. So the question is, is that going to introduce uncertainty? Is that going to force all these banks to have to have more of a buffer. On the specifics for us, if you use the last three year\u2019s scenarios, our stress capital buffer will be 2.5%, because we\u2019d be below the floor. And on an ongoing forward-looking basis, we feel good about the stress depletion and the stress capital buffer because of the way we run the company, and we\u2019re focused on responsible growth, loans in consumer prime and super price. We\u2019re prudent about our trading risk. We have a low VAR. We have a legacy portfolio that\u2019s running off. Having said that though, the scenario severity will create volatility, So we don\u2019t have - and we don\u2019t have transparency into event models. So we\u2019re just going to have to wait and see this year\u2019s results and future results and we\u2019re going to have to have a common period. We\u2019re going to have - we\u2019re going to give our comments and we\u2019re going to come to later find out what the final rule is like. Betsy Graseck : Sure. And just thinking in particular about the SLR ratio, which is quite high. And is there an opportunity for you to deploy some of that in - under the new rule set maybe a little bit more than peers? Paul Donofrio : I think it\u2019s - I think that\u2019s helpful, given the recalibration as proposed the SLR certainly makes more sense now. It was a buying strengths for lots of banks, not for us. It was a binding constraint and it really is meant to be more of a backstop. So this feels like it makes more sense. In terms of the impact on us, it\u2019s going to be most helpful at our bank entities, reducing the well-capitalized levels by about 175 basis points from 6 to 4.25, and that\u2019s going to allow us to have more flexibility in terms of taking some of that capital that\u2019s in our banking entities and moving it up the chain. So that we can support other businesses or potentially doing more business and better than who otherwise would have been able to do. And if we move it up, obviously, becomes free for all the users, including the return it to shareholders. So, again, it\u2019s an NPR, well, let\u2019s see how it pans out, but I think that\u2019s constructive. Betsy Graseck : Okay. Thanks, Paul. And then, Brian, a follow-up on the expense question. I know you said $53 billion expenses for 2018 and I believe flat in 2019. So one of the questions you\u2019ve been getting is around the branch build out of 500 branches that you\u2019re looking to do in new markets. Does the branch build out, is that a net neutral to these numbers of $53 billion, or you - have you factored that into that expense expectation? Brian Moynihan : Those investments are all sort of factored in the flattish from here. It\u2019s over four years obviously the build amount. And remember that, you build them and you staff them up. And so it\u2019s a sort of ratable build up. So we\u2019ll - we\u2019re comfortable with a flattishness and we\u2019ll pay for those. The question we\u2019ve all asked ourselves over and over again, so it\u2019s proving very successful, can even accelerate it faster. That come down to the fact questions are getting leases and things and up and running. But if it provided a lot more pop, we might move it up and that might cause a little bit more if it would be modest. Betsy Graseck : And I know a while ago you mentioned processing costs associated with cash and checks were pretty high, if I recall correctly, somewhere around $5 billion with all the digital activity that you\u2019re doing now. Has that materially gone down yet? Brian Moynihan : It\u2019s going down. The 20% of deposits on mobile versus the branch that Paul spoke about earlier, the P2P and Zelle, getting more meaningful. The digital movement of money is half the money moved by consumers today. It\u2019s all adding positive pressure. It\u2019s not going to be immediately changed. It\u2019s not going to immediately change. It\u2019s allowed us over the last 10 years ago from 6,100 branches to 4,400 in change or whatever is that now. It\u2019s allowed us to increase ATMs and effectiveness at the same time bringing the overall cost down for them. So the volume - we\u2019re absorbing massive volume increases too. And so in terms of checks and money movement, this year the cash in the first quarter - they are all means the payment in the first quarter up 9% over last year yet the cost and consumers you can see are modestly up and efficiency ratios dropped a little bit - is right around 50% now. So it\u2019s all good, but don\u2019t expect there will be a massive step function in a day, it really takes a change in customer behavior over time. Betsy Graseck : Got it. Okay. Thanks so much, Brian. Operator : Our next question is from Mike Mayo of Wells Fargo. Mike Mayo : All right. I guess, I have a good news, bad news question. But the bad news for you, Brian. The Tax Cut was supposed to lead to a lot of a loan growth, the higher rates were supposed to lead to much higher margins. The volatility was expected to lead to much higher trading not from your gardens, but just generally in the market, as we say here, it looks like it\u2019s been a good meal, but where is the dessert? So I guess, the question there is should we expect more of a benefit from that in the future? If not, why, or how long does it take? And then the good news is, even without the dessert, so to speak, are you guys still had some very nice efficiency. So if you could elaborate more on the record consumer efficiency and tie that more into the $1.4 billion quarterly hits you had in digital banking like how much of the consumer efficiency is due to digital versus, say, branch closures or other actions? So where do you think that can go? Brian Moynihan : Yes. I mean, Mike, you\u2019re sort of stating the debate that\u2019s going on. And we have seen loan growth of 5% year-over-year in the core business, 3% overall. Remember, we\u2019re still running up some portfolios, believe or not, 10 years after the crisis that we show you on that slide. So in our view, that\u2019s solid loan growth. And if you look at it, like what\u2019s in the commercial business, the C&I product, I think up mid single 5% the consumer lending up. And so it\u2019s solid loan growth. We have been growing at a decent clip. We expect that to continue. It\u2019s a 2% to 2.5% type of growth of economy we\u2019re experiencing currently as we speak. The projections are higher going forward, but we\u2019ve got to get there. So, I think that\u2019s there. I think on margin expansion, if you think about it from an operating profit, to your point, the efficiency ratio drifted below 60, which means we\u2019re expanding our pre-tax operating profits and revenue over expense. In terms of NII, there\u2019s some sales that went on that Paul explained earlier. And the trading in equities was up 38% year-over-year, again, solid, but it - again, that nominal was about $400 million compared with $500 million of NII expense. So you got to keep all these things, I think, a balance, which I think is kind of what you\u2019re saying. As we look out, we expect constructive economy in the rest of the year. Our experts have it continuing to grow with an all-in growth rate for the U.S. economy of 2.9% in GDP for the 2018, which would be a nice pick up over last year. And you\u2019ve got to expect the elements that we talked about to grow within that. I think you - then my consumer, I think, the story is the same. It\u2019s - every - going to Betsy\u2019s earlier question, people look for this overnight change. It\u2019s going to be a change, it\u2019s going to occur every single quarter. So $1.4 billion mobile logins this quarter - this first quarter versus $1 billion last year, allow us to have 20% sales in that business, allow us to have 20%-odd checks deposit in that business, all that saves us efficiency. At the same time, we still have 850,000 people coming to branches every day that need to have highly qualified capable people servicing, so investing in those sales professionals. So, I think it\u2019s just going to keep going in the right direction and all that bodes well to helping us make that change with expenses basically down in the company year-over-year and consumer basically flattish. Mike Mayo : And just one follow-up. And so the $1.4 billion digital banking hits per quarter. How does that help other metrics, say, call center personnel, or how many more branches can you close, or how many people just anything else concrete you could give us? Brian Moynihan : The calls were down about 14% year-over-year, I think, it\u2019s round numbers to give you a sense, I believe, I think that\u2019s the number, it\u2019s 14%. So it all helps. The sales are up, deposits are up, and so that all helps. But remember, don\u2019t forget this is a high touch - high tech high touch system. And so you have to be able to do both and do both well. It\u2019s just that the - what the - these techniques whether it\u2019s ATM capabilities, whether it\u2019s the digital devices, mobile device capabilities allow you to do more value-added tax for lack of better term in the branches in their stores than we used to do, which was just deposit checks and things like that. So deposits at the branches can tend to trend down and go up in mobile. But it\u2019s a trend that will continue over many years. Mike Mayo : Brian, thank you. Brian Moynihan : \u2026quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year again and again, while we\u2019re still adding new branches and investing in those cities at the same time. Mike Mayo : So do you still expect branches to decline with all those branch additions? Brian Moynihan : It\u2019s always going to be a question of modest changes, because remember, we\u2019re adding the branches and taking them out and redoing branches and making them bigger. So the count, I think, could - can bounce around it, if you look across the last several quarters, it\u2019s been slightly down as we build our branches that have put upside to it, but you also see it\u2019s consolidating branches in cities. So it\u2019s a really configuration. We are like any other person looking at what the optimal configuration is in a given time. So we might take two or three branches and fold them together in a city, because the nature of business has changed. So I don\u2019t ever make long-term projections at number, because if I told you many years ago to go from 6,100 to 4,400, you just said I was - you said Bank of America is crazy and in fact, it did that. Mike Mayo : All right. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Glenn Schorr of Evercore ISI. Glenn Schorr : Hi, thank you. First question on trading FIC down 13%, I got all your comments appreciate it, but trading assets were up 17% year-on-year. So we can\u2019t see trading assets split between second equity. So just looking for a little more color, was the decline in FIC mostly a reduction activity in credit, where is the increase in trading assets flowing? Paul Donofrio : Sure. So on a year-over-year basis a lot of the increase in Global Markets was a result of client activity in equities. Quarter-over-quarter, it was probably more FIC. It\u2019s being driven by client demand and it\u2019s also being driven by the opportunity we see in equities to do more with our customers and to build some scale. Glenn Schorr : Is that prime brokerage? Is that the risk? Is it all the above? Paul Donofrio : Yes, it\u2019s prime brokerage and derivatives exactly. But I would - but I would put prime brokerage first. Glenn Schorr : Okay, that\u2019s good. And then just one other question. I think in the past, a flatter yield curve was a predictor of a slowdown in or credit issues, a slowdown in maybe economy or maybe even a recession. But the curve is pretty darn flat right now, but the economy is great. So curious from your vantage point what it means for your balance sheet? How you\u2019re positioned businesswise and balance sheet wise? And how much we should be concerned about the flatter curve? Paul Donofrio : Look, we are positioning in our balance sheet to service our customers. Obviously, we look carefully at balancing capital liquidity and earnings when we do that. The primary motivation is serving our customers. The flatter yield curve, we [indiscernible] a little bit deeper improvement in NII comes on the short end. We are in a situation today, where securities rolling off the balance sheet are being replaced by securities at higher yields, so that\u2019s good. You saw some impact on OCI this quarter, because rates rose. So we\u2019ve got to be watchful of that. But again, it\u2019s not like we\u2019re out there doing derivatives or doing other things to manufacture a certain type of balance sheet. We are basically - have a balance sheet that services our customers needs. It grows when there\u2019s more activity from them. We have to make sure we have enough liquidity and enough capital to run the company in good times and bad, and I think we\u2019re doing all those things. Glenn Schorr : Super helpful answer. Thanks so much. Operator : We\u2019ll move next to Ken Usdin of Jefferies. Your line is open. Ken Usdin : Thanks. Good morning. I was wondering where if you could talk a little bit about the structure of the balance sheet. And I notice that you did have a lot of this cash coming a lot of balances in lower yielding parts of the balance sheet and you also had a smaller securities portfolio, both the period-end and average. Can you talk about how much of that was just episodic, or if it was a purposeful change, given the movement to the yield curve? And how you might think about that kind of mix of the lower yielding assets and mix going forward? Thanks. Paul Donofrio : Sure. So a couple of things in there. Remind me if I don\u2019t get all of them. But first of all, on the securities portfolio there\u2019s no change in how we\u2019re managing the securities portfolio. The reduction you\u2019re seeing is just the function of long-term rates going up and the effect on the available sales securities in terms of the client and their value that flows through OCI hits equity. In terms of - we discussed kind of the impact on the company\u2019s net interest margin or net interest yield whatever you prefer, that is being affected by one, the fact that UK card we sold in the second quarter; but two, we\u2019re growing global market assets. We just talked about the fact that we\u2019ve been growing them on a multi-quarter basis now in equities. When you grow the balance sheet in equities, you create interest expense. You don\u2019t create interest income that benefit shows up in the trading line. But this quarter with any volatility, we had a 38% increase in our fees in equities. In terms of the cash you\u2019re seeing on the balance sheet, yes, deposit, we have deposit growth. We saw some cash build up. That cash build up a lot of it, I think, is for people who want to pay their taxes. So a portion of that cash buildup is going to run out in the second quarter. Did I hit all your questions or was there something else? Ken Usdin : Yes. No, that\u2019s exactly it, because it just - obviously, you had a huge balance sheet growth, but the NIM was flat and it was largely just because of this mix. So I\u2019m just wondering how much of that mix might naturally revert back out. You don\u2019t see as much balance sheet growth, but you see the NIM start to move through? Paul Donofrio : Well, the UK card thing will roll off, obviously. Ken Usdin : Yes. Paul Donofrio : We\u2019re still going to grow our balance sheet in markets. We\u2019ll grow if the client demand is there. We\u2019re always looking at it to make sure we\u2019re getting the right returns. We feel good about the investment we\u2019re making there. And you can see that when the - some volatility happens, we got the return we were expecting. Also, that balance - that balance sheet growth in markets a lot of it is very low RWA. You saw the RWA comes down under the advanced approach this quarter, even though we\u2019ve been growing the balance sheet in markets. So it\u2019s an investment. We\u2019re watching it. We think we\u2019re getting the right returns. And the bottom line is, NII is up $550 million year-over-year. Ken Usdin : Yes, that\u2019s exactly the point. Great. And then if I can follow-up just on the commercial lending front. You guys would also seem to me among the best positioned to see the small business, middle market commercial uptick. Can you just talk about end demand and the tone you\u2019re hearing and how you - when are we going to - when and if we\u2019re going to see that translation into balance? Because I heard your intro comments that things are good underneath, but just if you can flavor it by the product segment, that would be great? Thanks. Paul Donofrio : Sure. Look, we are optimistic about loan growth. We - we\u2019ve been seeing mid single-digit loan growth in our business segments. We\u2019ve been seeing C&I growth 4% or 5% every quarter. As you know, we haven\u2019t - we\u2019re more cautious in CRE. So the fact that we\u2019re able to grow loans in Global Banking by as much as we have, even though we\u2019ve been more cautious in CRE is another indication of the strength of our platform. It\u2019s another indication of the value of these new bankers we\u2019re adding in local markets. We have repatriation, I think, some of the dollars did go to pay down some loans. I think, we saw that in large corporate. You may have seen a little bit of it in middle market. I hate to say it, but anecdotally, if you look at the average balances in middle market, you compare them to quarter-end balances. We clearly saw a little bit of an increase at the end of the quarter. So, look, we feel very good. We\u2019re optimistic. Ken Usdin : Thanks a lot, Paul. Operator : We\u2019ll move next to Gerard Cassidy of RBC. Your line is open. Gerard Cassidy : Good morning, Brian. Brian Moynihan : Good morning, Gerard. Gerard Cassidy : Brian, can you give us some color? Your Consumer Banking digital trends are obviously very strong. Can you tell us what advantage of that is giving you over the smaller banks? And then second, the - there\u2019s a lot of talk about non-banks may be coming into this area, the classic Amazon effect. Could you give us some of your thoughts about that as well? Brian Moynihan : Right. I think just on the broader question. Our job is management and the team was to be the best there is at digital banking, mobile banking, et cetera, across all the platforms. And so we have been investing heavily for many, many years. This mobile platform just didn\u2019t arrive it in the online platform. This is a billion dollars of investments across probably last six years or something like that to get there in terms of building it out. So no matter who comes in, our job is to be more confident and more capable than anybody whether there are competitors in the traditional industry or new competitors. And that\u2019s why we continue to upgrade the capabilities and driving it. And so think about what we\u2019ve done. Erica is a voice-activated artificial intelligence agent. And you could go in and say, send Brian $5 and it\u2019ll come to Brian. So all we can go do that if you want. It\u2019s pretty simple. It allows people to find balances and do things by talking to the computer. It will improve across time and we\u2019re starting to - we had 40,000 teammates working on it. But it\u2019s an exciting thing. It\u2019s payback will be over the next decade, but it\u2019s competitive advantage is high. If you take the Zelle, we\u2019ve processed almost 29 million transactions over the first quarter. It adds up over 100%. But importantly, I think, it\u2019s up dramatically even from last quarter. So you\u2019re seeing that go on. Digital sales are 26%. These numbers are hard to get comparisons on, but we think that the banking industry generally sub-10%. We think that all of our retailers even including Amazon in the non-banking space is maybe in the mid-teens as a percentage of sales maybe high-teens, but we\u2019re 26% today. And things like our auto program, I think, it\u2019s multiple - we\u2019ve got multiples of applications with us, new application. It\u2019s rolled out to 2,000 dealers, where we can see 2,000 dealers car inventory on our site and go buy and qualify for loan at the same time. So all these things we\u2019re getting tens of thousands appointments per week. But people set an appointment on a digital to come in which allows us to staff more appropriately. So I think the point is that, these are tremendous capabilities with major investments that will pay off not only to date, but over time. And I think it\u2019s a good against all comers, large, small, traditional competitors and anybody outside the industry, and our job is to continue to invest to do it. When we put that altogether, we\u2019ve grown the customer base. We\u2019ve grown what they do with this. The customer satisfaction scores are at all-time highs at the same time in both in the branch and non-branch. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. And as a follow-up, Paul, you talked a little bit about the commercial real estate loan portfolio growing. You\u2019re more cautious. Some of the banks that have reported results have indicated that some of the underwriting in commercial real estate is getting too aggressive. Can you give us more color? Are you seeing that as well? And how are you being more cautious in your underwriting? Paul Donofrio : We have been more cautious for many, many, many, many quarters now. So we\u2019ve been talking about it for a over a year. We\u2019ve just made. We stuck to our client selection, which are the higher quality players in the industry. And we\u2019ve stuck to structure that we thought made sense. It\u2019s been in multifamily and other places, structures and we\u2019re getting a little bit to a place, where we were not comfortable. So we\u2019ve been growing, but it\u2019s just been a different level of growth relative to many of our competitors. But it\u2019s something, again, it\u2019s not something we\u2019ve done this quarter, something we have been focused on and cautious about for many quarters now. So we feel pretty good about where we are in commercial real estate. And by the way, we\u2019re kind of seeing, again, this is more anecdotal. But we\u2019re kind of seeing now that as others are getting nervous, we\u2019re seeing business come our way at prices and structures that we like. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Brian Moynihan : Thanks, Gerard. Operator : We\u2019ll move next to Matt O\u2019Connor of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Matt O\u2019Connor: Good morning. Brian Moynihan : Good morning, Matt. Matt O\u2019Connor: Just a follow-up on the NIM. You had mentioned the drags on a year-over-year basis from the card sale and the market\u2019s impact was 12 basis points. I don\u2019t know if I missed what the Q-Q swing was from the markets? Paul Donofrio : I mean, the quarter-over-quarter for Q2 to Q1? Matt O\u2019Connor: Exactly. Paul Donofrio : Yes, it\u2019s impacted by the growth in Global Markets, but it\u2019s also impacted quarter-over-quarter by the change in corporate tax rate on an FTE basis. You\u2019ve got to factor that as well. So it\u2019s a couple of basis points. Matt O\u2019Connor: Combine the $100 million lower TEA and the market\u2019s impact is a couple of basis points combined? Paul Donofrio : I think that\u2019s right. We\u2019ll get back to you, Matt. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay. Okay. And then just separately, deposits overall continue to grow, but we saw some decline in the non-interest bearing bucket. And I think versus 4Q there\u2019s some seasonality, but obviously, it was also down year-over-year. And just wondering what your thoughts are in terms of how much further pressure there might be in that category? And which business segment, I think, is probably in the - it\u2019s not in the consumer side, it sounds like, which segment that\u2019s coming from? Paul Donofrio : Yes, it\u2019s coming from the Global Banking side. We expected to see rotation between non-IB and IB and Global Banking. We\u2019re still growing deposits there well up 6% year-over-year. The growth is across large corporates and middle market. International is also growing well. But we are seeing a mix shift there over the last couple of quarters. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay. And I guess, that is that factored in the rate sensitivity that as you\u2019ve disclosed further erosion there? Paul Donofrio : Yes, it is. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay. All right. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Marty Mosby of Vining Sparks. Marty Mosby : Thanks. Two questions. First, Paul, since you\u2019re getting them mark-to-market in your equity already. Is there some thought that periodically you\u2019ll go in and refresh the yields to get the benefit in the income statement, while you\u2019re already taking the hit on the equity side? Paul Donofrio : No, I mean, we\u2019re just going to follow normal GAAP accounting. So only I\u2019ll say what, by the way just, it\u2019s interesting. If you look at our balance sheet, right, over $2 trillion, you\u2019ve got a portion of it. The AFS securities portfolio, which is $230 billion, which is mark-to-market and close to OCI, but basically, nothing else does. So the value of our deposits, the value of our debt that we - the money we raise that we borrow that doesn\u2019t change in value. So it\u2019s just an accounting construct that all banks have to deal with. Marty Mosby : I understand, kind of - maybe I didn\u2019t add - I did the question right. I\u2019m thinking you can take actions, because you\u2019re forced to already recognize the loss in the AFS portfolio. You might as well go ahead and restructure to be able to buy new bonds, I think you\u2019re buying the same duration, because you can generally add, just do the math somewhere between $0.15 and $0.20 just by going in and rounding up the yields when you\u2019re already taking the hit on the equity side? Paul Donofrio : Look, we are - the way our securities portfolio works is, we grow deposits and we try to put all that deposit growth to work in customer assets within our client and risk framework. And if we don\u2019t have enough demand there, it goes in the securities portfolio. We\u2019re buying securities that we think makes sense to balance liquidity, earnings and capital of the company in all sorts of market environments. Brian Moynihan : So Marty, just to be simple. We\u2019re not going to take losses to - in the current period to hit equity and to have just repositioned the portfolio. It will runoff over time and it\u2019s all in the interest rate sensitivity numbers Paul gave you and it reaped about, I don\u2019t know, tens of billions of dollars come through each quarter that we have to put back to work and it ratchets up in a high-rate environment. So don\u2019t expect us to do anything. Marty Mosby : Okay. And then, Brian, the second question I really want to focus on was, you\u2019ve kind of eliminated the tracking of mortgage banking as even a line item on the income statement for fees. It\u2019s my background and being interested just in that particular business. You\u2019ve gone from buying countrywide, which was supposed to be a major strategic move for the company we all know what happened there, not - by any of you - all is falling, you\u2019ve done a great job of working through that. But just thinking strategically from where you come from and not being a business segment and now is actually limited in the sense of what you\u2019re looking at from a line item on the fee income statement. So just strategically, kind of think about that shift and what that means going forward? Brian Moynihan : What it doesn\u2019t mean is that we\u2019re not delivering mortgage loans for our customers and home equity loans. We did $9-plus billion this quarter mortgage, $3 billion-plus in home equity loans and we\u2019ll continue to do that. The issue is when you put them on your balance sheet, there\u2019s no sale, gain on sale. When the mortgage servicing portfolio is running down to be a core business, the amount of fees there\u2019s not as high. The MSR is down to few billion dollars and running off. And so it\u2019s just immaterial, Marty, that\u2019s the problem. Marty Mosby : Right. Brian Moynihan : But it\u2019s not - it\u2019s immaterial from a financial reporting in the context of $23 billion in revenue a quarter. But it\u2019s not immaterial in our minds of consumer customers and our wealth management customers. And there, you can see that we continue to drive our mortgage capabilities through it, including this quarter introducing a digital mortgage product that I think is going to be the best in the industry. Paul Donofrio : Remember, Marty, we are focused on revenue. We\u2019re not focused on the fee line or the NIM lines, exclusively, we\u2019re focused on revenue. So these are - we\u2019re making loans to our customers and we\u2019re making them prime and super prime. And so, why should we keep them on our balance sheet as opposed to selling them to an agency and having to pay insurance that really doesn\u2019t - it was overpriced for the amount of risk we\u2019re taking. So we feel really good about the strategy, because it increases revenue over time. Marty Mosby : I feel like you\u2019re making the right transitions here. Just interesting to see how far the industry has come from a transaction business to our balance sheet-driven business. So it\u2019s - there has been dramatic shifts and you all participated and led that as we\u2019ve gone through it. So thanks. Brian Moynihan : But remember, here it\u2019s a customer business. It\u2019s not a transaction business. It\u2019s not a balance sheet business. It\u2019s a customer business and that\u2019s how we\u2019ve been driving. Marty Mosby : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Brian Kleinhanzl of KBW. Brian Kleinhanzl : Good morning. Brian Moynihan : Good morning. Brian Kleinhanzl : I just had a quick question on the commercial. You said you were able to grow C&I around 4% and 5%. Is there anyway to break that down between just overall growth among existing customers versus what you\u2019re getting from entrance into new markets? Trying to get a sense of how much further you could go just by entering new markets and you continue to push C&I growth more? Paul Donofrio : So we can follow-up with you on that. I\u2019m not sure I have those numbers with me. But it\u2019s our customers obviously. And we are - have been, we\u2019ve added hundreds of bankers in business banking and commercial banking. We\u2019ve added in local markets all around the U.S., where we feel like there\u2019s opportunities and that\u2019s clearly contributing to the growth. Some of that C&I growth is in wealth management, where we\u2019ve seen nice growth as well and we have a lot of the phase out there talking to clients. And again, we\u2019re concentrating our bankers, our new branches in those markets where we have those bankers and where we have those wealth advisors. So that, we can deliver in those local markets. And I think, you\u2019re seeing the benefit of that in loan growth generally with certainly in C&I. Brian Moynihan : Brian, I think I\u2019d say is, as we have done a good job in the small business segment and the business banking, which I think $50 million under revenue companies for business banking and to - $5 under for small business. I think in small business this quarter year-over-year, we had about a 9% growth in loan balances and business banking probably had mid single digits, and that shows you sort of the breadth of the franchise. Albeit, the total is two portfolios probably $50 billion, $60 billion in total. So you\u2019ve got to be careful when you put it against the $400 billion in total commercial balances. But if you think about from the next economic indicator, the growth in our company success and that shows that those mainstream SME-type companies are out there are borrowing more and doing more and we expect that to continue because of the economy going forward. Brian Kleinhanzl : Okay, thanks. And then just a separate question. You did mention that you saw the brokerage balances tick up this quarter. Was that something that you had done internally to try to manage those balances higher? Was it just customer engagement that hadn\u2019t been there for a while? Is this a trend? Can you just elaborate further on that? Thanks. Paul Donofrio : You\u2019re talking about brokerage assets\u2026 Brian Kleinhanzl : Correct. Paul Donofrio : \u2026that\u2019s in wealth management. Brian Kleinhanzl : Right. Paul Donofrio : \u2026in institutional wealth management, right. Brian Kleinhanzl : Correct. Paul Donofrio : Is it institutional brokerage assets or wealth management brokerage assets? Brian Kleinhanzl : The wealth management brokerage assets? Paul Donofrio : Okay. Yes, we - the balances have been declining for many quarters as people shifted to AUM. And this was the first time in two years, I think, that balances were actually up. Remember, balances go up, because the market goes up, balances go up because of flows and the combination of those two things for the first time in many quarters saw an increase. Brian Moynihan : And again, just similar to the small business business banking relative to commercial underneath that - the Merrill Edge piece, which is geared in the mass affluent market segment is - had record flows and it\u2019s growing 18%, 20% year-over-year. That again is $175 billion, $200 billion in total balances, but it\u2019s growing nicely. And as it gets bigger starting to actually having a contribution to the total, whereas in the past the Merrill Lynch U.S. Trust dwarfed it. So you\u2019ve seen that kick in and help us out on, what you call, quote brokerage balances. Brian Kleinhanzl : Okay, thanks. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll move next to Richard Bove of Hilton Capital. Richard Bove : Good morning. Just want to go back to the balance sheet issue. The company hasn\u2019t grown its common equity for roughly two years now and entering $7 billion in the current quarter and nothing fell down to common equity. And I\u2019m just wondering when the inability or the unwillingness to grow common equity have an impact on the secular growth rate of the business? Paul Donofrio : Well, I think while common equity didn\u2019t grow sort of linked-quarter, a lot of that had do with the OCI came and took a fair chunk of it away and we returned capital. But let\u2019s flip the other side of it. The balance sheet grew, loans grew, deposits grew. And so we\u2019re over capitalized, so we don\u2019t need to grow the notional amount to support the businesses, and that that\u2019s what we\u2019re driving at. So we - and then inside our loan balances, we have still $70 billion, $80 billion of runoff loans, which give us tremendous capacity. They\u2019re going to runoff over the next several years and we\u2019ll fill that back up with loans we want. So there\u2019s no inability to serve our customers and our clients implied by the equity being flat. Paul Donofrio : With a 11.3% CET1 ratio relative to 9.5% minimum, we have plenty of cushion, plenty of equity to be able to grow with our customers. Richard Bove : I think you\u2019ve done unbelievably good job - a phenomenal job, I would argue in terms of turning this company around. But I\u2019m just wondering, because I\u2019m going back two years and not just looking at one quarter, and I\u2019m seeing that common equity just doesn\u2019t grow. And at some point given the fact that assets do grow and market capitalization does grow, that common equity is going to have to grow, and I don\u2019t know when that is. But the second question is, we\u2019ve seen again, looking longer-term going back to the fourth quarter of 2015 something like 160, 165 basis point increase in the overnight rate and the net interest margin of the bank is up 25 basis points. The Fed funds rate is upward something like, I don\u2019t know, 80 basis points in the last year and the net interest margin is unchanged. Now I know there\u2019s a lot of dynamics mix of business shape of the yield curve, shape of the balance sheet, et cetera. But when does the - when does the net interest margin of this bank start to reflect the changes in overall interest rates in the economy? Brian Moynihan : Look, you\u2019ve talked about just the 2.39% when does it go up? Richard Bove : Yes. Brian Moynihan : Yes. Look, well, we told you that versus last year first quarter that have been up 12 basis points that we sold a portfolio of higher yielding cards. That\u2019s pretty much out of the system. So all during that time, you got to think about the dynamic of the loans that ran off that were more risky and charge-offs. And so take credit cards just across that time, you\u2019ll see that the risk-adjusted margin on a percent basis has been strong and obviously, charges-off have continued to work the way down. But the NIM of the company doesn\u2019t change a lot, because we ran up a lot of cards. We didn\u2019t want there in over the years that were causing a lot of charge-offs. So I think you\u2019ve got it right. It\u2019s all that stuff, but the key is, on the deposit side, we can keep the pricing through a mix of deposits? And we\u2019ve done that. And on the yield side, because we don\u2019t have - because we have that capacity, we just talked about, a lot of stuff is mortgage loans and securities, which doesn\u2019t help on a yield side, but will help us rates for us. Richard Bove : Okay, thank you very much. Operator : And our final question comes from Nancy Bush of NAB Research. Nancy Bush : Good morning, gentlemen. Brian Moynihan : Good morning. Nancy Bush : Paul, back to this question on tangible book value. You guys, as I recall, after the crisis - Brian, I recall vividly you\u2019re saying that you\u2019re going to focus on tangible book value as you know an indication of the growth of the company. And we\u2019ve been used to not just for you, but everybody else in the industry saying TBV go up quarter after quarter after quarter. And now that\u2019s beginning to change mostly due to the OCI issue. Do you have to be more careful at this point on share repurchase and other capital actions just to keep the hit to TBV from not being extreme on a quarter-to-quarter basis? Brian Moynihan : I think if stock price we\u2019re going to deploy the capital back to shareholders and just through the structure, Nancy, you\u2019re more than familiar where this is going to go a substantial amount and stock buybacks. But the OCI you pointed out is the near-term risk and that will pull the par over time, as you well know. And that\u2019s an accounting convention that will go again\u2026 Nancy Bush : Right. Brian Moynihan : That - it\u2019s $12 billion in gross number now, I think, yes. So think about that as - that\u2019s an after-tax number, that\u2019s a 1.20 a share right there that will pull the par over time. Nancy Bush : Okay. Secondly, on the growth - the underlying growth issue, I think, you said the underlying loan growth was 5%, but the reported growth was 3% due to the runoff of these non-core portfolios. Has there been any thought about sort of accelerating the disposition of these portfolios? So that the underlying growth becomes more apparent. I mean, would it take a capital hit at this point, or are they not buyers, or do you just think it\u2019s better to work these things out over time? Brian Moynihan : Well, we\u2019ve taken all approaches, so we\u2019ve sold some. We\u2019ve let some runoff. We\u2019ve restructured at the customer level. And the stuff we have now frankly is, the credit quality is - there\u2019s a - there\u2019s still bumps that we\u2019re working through. But generally, the credit qualities have been improving. And so we\u2019re just letting it go on its ordinary course. The - I think you can see on Slide 6, you can see that that number is now down to about $68 billion, year-over-year down $30 billion, and a lot of that year-over-year was sales and things we moved some stuff out. But I don\u2019t expect - there are buyers, but frankly, the economics we always look at as opposed to the growth rate, and I think, we\u2019re trying to maximize the value for all of you and us as shareholders. And it\u2019s just - we look at every trade and we try to figure out what the every possible piece and what the trade is and what it makes sense. And so the good news is it\u2019s down to $68 billion from what it was probably $250 billion a years ago and it\u2019s sort of running off at a slower amount. And so we\u2019ll work through it, Nancy, it\u2019s not - but if there\u2019s an opportunity to move some of that, we do. Paul Donofrio : If you take that portfolio in total, Nancy, you should not be thinking that there is a loss there. Nancy Bush : Okay, all right. Brian Moynihan : We\u2019ve gotten through most of that problem. Nancy Bush : Okay. Thank you. Brian Moynihan : Thank you. Well, thank you, everyone, and thank you for your questions. We had a strong quarter, record earnings for our company. We did that by driving responsible growth. The key to that is driving operating leverage and you can see that in our efficiency ratio going below 60% for the first time in a long time. We look forward to next quarter and we\u2019ll see you then. Thank you. Operator : This does conclude today\u2019s Bank of America\u2019s first quarter earnings announcement 2018. You may now disconnect your lines, and everyone have a great day.",

Later, you\u2019ll have the opportunity to ask questions during the question and answer session. You may register to ask a question at any time by pressing star and one on your touchtone phone, and withdraw yourself from the queue by pressing the pound key. Please note this call is being recorded. It\u2019s now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Mr. Lee McIntyre. Please go ahead. Lee McIntyre : Good morning. Thanks for joining this morning\u2019s call to review our second quarter 2018 results. By now, I hope everybody has had a chance to review the earnings release documents on the IR website of the bankofamerica.com site. Before I turn the call over to our CEO, Brian Moynihan, let me remind you we may make forward-looking statements during the call. After Brian\u2019s comments, our CFO, Paul Donofrio will review the details of the second quarter results, then we\u2019ll open it up for questions. Please limit your questions and then you can have a follow-up afterwards, but limit it to one question if you can. For further information on forward-looking comments, please refer to either our earnings release documents, our website or the SEC filings that we post. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Brian. Brian Moynihan : Thank you, Lee, and thank all of you for joining us to review our second quarter results. Continued solid client activity in a growing economy coupled with strong cost and risk management discipline resulted in a strong quarter of results. Combined with quarter one, the earnings this quarter brings us to $13.7 billion in net income for the first six months. This is the best start to a year in the company\u2019s history, more than 20% higher than the previous record. Driving responsible growth has resulted in consistent results for shareholders. It has enabled us to increase returns and support customer growth in a real economy, and to continue to invest through our operational excellence. Net income for the quarter was $6.8 billion after tax and it grew 33% from last year. Our return on tangible common equity was more than 15%. We delivered positive operating leverage for the 14th consecutive quarter. We drove the efficiency ratio below 59%, an improvement of 249 basis points in just 12 months. While it\u2019s of course true the tax reform is benefiting our bottom line as well as corporations around America, income before taxes also grew. In second quarter, reported pre-tax income improved 5% year-over-year, but after adjusting for some select items which Paul is going to cover later, a better way to look at it is pre-tax income is up 11%. Our balance sheet from both a capital and liquidity standpoint remains extremely strong. We announced following the June CCAR results in 2018, we plan on returning roughly $26 billion to you, our shareholders, over the next 12 months through a combination of share repurchase and dividends. This is a strong improvement from last year\u2019s initial CCAR approval in June of 2017, where we were approved to return $17 billion in capital. Our immediate priority remains to use capital to buy back shares that we don\u2019t need for business growth, but importantly we increased our dividend by 25%. Our responsible growth strategy continues to work, growing earnings returns and capital returns and doing so the right way. This quarter, we demonstrated growth within our defined customer and risk framework, and we did it organically. When you think about it year-over-year, we grew average loans by more than 5% in the aggregate across the businesses. We grew average deposits by more than 3%. This quarter marks the 11th straight quarter where Bank of America has grown its average deposits more than $40 billion on a year-over-year quarter comparison basis. We added more credit cards, we added more checking accounts on the consumer side, and we added more accounts and households in our Merrill Edge online brokerage. We also had a strong quarter in our wealth management business as we formed more households than we had in any quarter in the past. Importantly, we see our small business clients borrowing more. We originated during the second quarter of 2018 alone $2.3 billion of loans to small businesses. This helps facilitate the core economy and its growth. We also see more in our business banking and commercial banking customers and continue to deepen relationships with them. The other aspect is to make sure we stay within our risk framework. As you can see on Slide 2, credit continues to perform well with a 43 basis point net charge-off ratio this quarter. Since coming out of the crisis and stabilizing, we\u2019ve now seen consistency over the last few years. In fact, the charge-off ratio has been below 50 basis points for 14 of the last 17 quarters. In global markets, we continue to see a strong return on our lower value at risk metric than many of our peers all while continuing to generate growth and improved profitability. We have earned a 15% return on capital in the global markets business year-to-date from Tom and the team. The other part of being sustainable is to invest while remaining efficient. We have to make investments in the communities we serve, investments in our talent and our company, and investment in our capabilities. By doing this, we believe we had a leading capability that will sustain us well into the future. How do we afford all that? We afford it through operational excellence. We\u2019ve been able to continue to invest and even have our costs continue to come down. Investments in our teammates have resulted in a strong, stable talent pool of tremendously effective teammates and attrition levels are at all-time historic lows. We continue to receive third party accolades as one of the best companies for people to work. If you move to Slide 3, when you put all that together, what happens? You get operating leverage. This slide shows you the 14th quarter in a row where we\u2019ve had positive operating leverage in our company. On a linked quarter basis, every business segment drove expenses lower from first quarter to second quarter, even as they continued to invest. When people ask for examples of how all this works, how can you invest in developing capabilities while continuing to take down costs and continuing to have higher customer satisfaction, I think the easier way for people to visualize that is in our consumer digital banking capabilities. Many of you use them, and all of you should. By investing in client capabilities, we make our clients\u2019 lives easier, more efficient for them, more effective for them, and their satisfaction goes up. Our costs then in turn go down because our processes become more automated. So how does that play out? Let\u2019s look at Slides 4 and 5. Here we display the results, and typically Paul will cover these [indiscernible], but I think it\u2019s important to understand how responsible growth in driving sustainable operating leverage works. As you can see on this slide, you can see some of the results of the investments we\u2019ve been making across decades to drive the business. The important thing is the size of our consumer base allows those investments to be leveraged. As you can see in the upper left hand corner, we crossed over 25 million active mobile users this quarter. Another 10 million use other digital channels, so that brings us to 35 million customers using digital devices this quarter on an active basis, and it continues to grow, as you can see, due to the innovation we had. Those mobile users, as you can see below, logged into their mobile apps nearly 1.4 billion times this quarter. What are they doing with us? You can see that in some of the other boxes. While they do transactions, they also use them for communication. They\u2019re using their digital services to set appointments in our financial services for their convenience, rather than just drop in. This assures we have the right teammates to serve the customers well. We had a half million digital appointments this quarter, but that\u2019s still a lot of room to grow when you think of the 50 million customers we have that walk into our great stores every day, so it\u2019s critical to have just both the digital and physical. As you can see in the roll-out of Erica, our digital assistant, you can do some tasks hands free or text, and that increases your flexibility. You can see Erica has grown nicely to over 2 million Erica users from only starting a few months ago. Customers are doing more of their regular deposit transactions on their digital devices. This quarter, we saw more deposit transactions by a person taking a picture of the deposit and sending over mobile phone than we did by a person handing their check to the teller. In fact, 76% of all our deposit transactions are now through ATMs and mobile deposit. This allows for more meaningful relationship management activities to take place in our centers as we invest more and add more teammates to do that. Customers just aren\u2019t transacting and researching with these capabilities, they\u2019re using them for sales. Digital sales now make up 24% of all our sales in our consumer business. This compares favorably with all sectors, including general retail in terms of digital sales. As we move to Slide 5, you can also see that the adoption rate is moving faster for these newer products. New capabilities are taken up much faster by the customer base who is completely digital enabled. On payments, you can see the early adoption of Zelle has grown. In the recent quarter, we processed 35 million Zelle transactions or more than $10 billion in principal amount - that\u2019s twice the pace of a year ago. We believe we account for about 25% of Zelle and this activity will continue to grow as the industry continues to drive this as our standard for P2P payments. Overall, consumer digital payments have now overtaken non-digital payments, more than $368 billion in digital payments at the bottom of Slide 5 you can see. Over 52% of total payments have come in this quarter. This is growing 12% on average for the past four years. As you can see on sales, 24% of sales are executed digitally and we continue to expand that through other products and services. Digital auto was launched a year ago and now more than half our retail auto volume. Digital mortgage, which is a true end-to-end digital experience just brought out recently, you can see is growing fast; and on investments in the lower right hand side, you can see the Merrill Edge platform growing assets 20% in the past year to $191 billion and 2.5 million accounts. We have parlayed that and our capabilities for our automated Merrill Edge guided investment platform, that you can see the statistics. These examples are just a set of examples about how the sustained investment coupled with the change in customer behavior coupled with the process improvement coupled with the operating excellence allows us to drive positive operating leverage while driving up customer delight. There are many other examples across our company, including Cash Pro in our commercial set of businesses, which has 475,000 commercial users. We\u2019ll continue to make these investments and continue to drive the operating leverage of the company, and that will provide good utility for you, our shareholders. Now let me turn it over to Paul to handle the financial results. Paul? Paul Donofrio : Thanks Brian. I will start on Slide 6. Bank of America reported net income of $6.8 billion or $0.63 per diluted share. Net income was up 33% from 2Q17, EPS grew 43%. Once again, our earnings growth was driven by strong operating leverage and continued strong asset quality in addition to the benefits of tax reform. Before I review comparative period performance, let me remind you of a few select items which I think are helpful in understanding our operating performance. In 2Q17, we had a net after-tax gain from the sale of our U.K. card consumer business of roughly $100 million, which included a revenue benefit of nearly $800 million in other income mostly offset by a tax cost of nearly $700 million, so revenue was $22.6 billion on a reported basis, down 1% versus 2Q17, however excluding the impact of the U.K. card gain, revenue was up 3% year-over-year driven by NII improvement and better sales and trading results. Another notable item in 2Q17 was in expenses. We had a $300 million impairment charge associated with the sales in data centers, so expense of $13.3 billion on a reported basis was down 5% from 2Q17, but excluding that charge, expenses declined 3% or nearly $400 million. After excluding both of the 2Q17 revenue and expense items, operating leverage was 6% and pre-tax income improved 11%, as Brian noted. I would also note two items in our 2Q18 results which had a combined negative pre-tax impact of roughly $160 million in other income; however, these items are not part of the select items adjusted for on this page and in our release. The first item was a charge of $729 million from the redemption of some trust-preferred securities. The second item was a gain of $572 million from the sale of some non-core mortgage loans. Net DBA negatively impacted the quarter by $179 million. Provision expense was $827 million, $101 million higher than 2Q17 driven primarily by the seasoning of our credit card portfolio, loan growth, and a modestly lower reserve release. Brian already covered the significant improvement in returns seen on this slide. The effective tax rate for the quarter was a little more than 20%, which includes the ongoing benefit from the Tax Act. We would expect the tax rate to be roughly 21% in the second half of 2018, absent unusual items. Turning to the balance sheet on Slide 7, overall compared to the end of Q1, end of period assets of $2.3 trillion decreased $37 billion, driven by lower global markets assets as well lower deposit levels, primarily due to seasonal customer tax payments. Liquidity remains strong with average global liquidity sources of $512 billion and a liquidity coverage ratio of 122%. Total shareholders equity decreased $2 billion from Q1. Preferred equity was down $1.5 billion in the quarter. If you look at the first half of the year, we issued $3.5 billion of lower yielding preferred stock ahead of redemptions of $2.8 billion of higher yielding preferred stock, and note we have called another $900 million that will settle in the third quarter. Given a billion dollar decline in the value of AFS securities, which impacts OCI, common equity decreased by half a billion dollars as we returned 90% of net income earned in the quarter to our shareholder via dividends and repurchases. In Q2, we repurchased 166 million shares for $5 billion and paid $1.2 billion in common dividends. Turning to regulatory metrics, this is the first quarter in which our RWA under standardized exceeds RWA under advanced. Standardized RWA increased $8 billion from Q1 due to lower trading exposure on global markets and continued runoff of legacy mortgages. CET1 capital was flat from Q1 as net income and lower DTA disallowance was offset by share repurchases, dividends and OCI. Our CET1 standardized ratio improved to 11.4% and remained well above our 9.5% requirement. The supplementary leverage ratio remains well above U.S. regulatory minimums. Turning to Slide 8, on an average basis total loans increased to $935 billion. Note that the 2Q17 sale of U.K. card impacted the year-over-year comparisons by nearly $6.5 billion. Adjusting for the U.K. card balances, which we recorded in all other, average loans were up $26.6 billion or 3% year-over-year. Total loan growth continued to be impacted by the runoff of non-core consumer real estate loans. On the other hand, loans in our business segments were up $45 billion or 5% year-over-year. Our consumer loans grew 6% year-over-year as clients grew card balances 5% and mortgage originations across both consumer banking and wealth management were equally strong. While we are seeing good growth in originations of home equity loans, they continue to be outpaced by pay-downs of older loans. Commercial loans grew 5% year-over-year. Consumer optimism carried over into small business as we originated $2.3 billion in loans and grew balances 6%. Strong year-over-year growth in structured lending with wealth management clients also contributed to commercial loan growth. Competition for commercial loans remains intense. We are seeing aggressive terms and structure; however, we remained disciplined. From a consistency standpoint, as you can see on the bottom right chart, loan growth in our business segment has been mid single digit consistently for several years now. This chart compares year-over-year growth over the past five quarters. Our growth has been led by consumer, which is consistent with what we\u2019re seeing in the economy. The recent moderation in the consumer growth rate is driven mostly by auto loans given our decision to focus on organic growth and rely less on third party flow. On the other hand, growth in consumer credit card has ticked up recently, and also note the modest increase in the growth rate in commercial. This has been driven by improvements in both small business and structured lending. Before turning the page, I just want to mention deposits as we think about funding this growth. Average deposits grew $44 billion or 3.5% year-over-year. Consumer banking once again led with growth of $35 billion or 5%. Deposits in wealth management declined in Q1, reflecting seasonal income tax payments and shifts to investments. Global banking deposits were strong, growing 8% and included movement from non-interest bearing to interest bearing. Turning to asset quality on Slide 9, total net charge-offs were $996 million or 43 basis points of average loans, and increased as expected. We saw seasonally higher losses in credit card. Note that we are now more than 180 days past the storms which impacted many U.S. areas. The small storm-related card losses which came through in this quarter were previously reserved for. Provision expense of $827 million in Q2 included a $169 million net reserve release. This reflects continued improvement in our consumer real estate and energy portfolios. The increase in net charge-offs versus 2Q17 was due primarily to credit card seasoning, loan growth and the storm-related losses. Compared to 1Q18, the increase was driven by commercial bouncing around the bottom. Our reserve coverage remains strong with an allowance to loan ratio of 1.08% and a coverage level 2.6 times our annual net charge-offs for the quarter. On Slide 10 we break out credit quality metrics for both our consumer and commercial portfolios. With respect to consumer, net charge-offs of $830 million were flat compared to 1Q18 and up $79 million from 2Q17. As mentioned, the driver of the year-over-year increase was credit card, which increased to 3.17% due to seasoning and growth, as well as storm-related losses. Excluding the storm-related losses, the credit card loss rate increased 22 basis points from 2Q17. Consumer NPLs of $4.6 billion declined 5% from Q1 and 47% of our consumer NPLs remain current on their payments. The commercial loss rate, excluding small business, remains strong at 9 basis points. While up from a low level in 1Q18, commercial losses continued to remain low. Other commercial asset quality metrics continued to improve as reservable critical exposure was down $1 billion from Q1 and NPLs declined 5%. Turning to Slide 11, net interest income on a GAAP non-FTE basis was $11.65 billion, $11 billion on an FTE basis. Compared to 2Q17, GAAP NII is up $654 million or 6%, reflecting the benefits of higher interest rates as well as loan and deposit growth. This growth is even more impressive given 2Q17 included $140 million of NII from the U.K. card business which we sold in June of last year. Note we have presented the interest yield excluding the impact of net interest income and related assets associated with our global markets segment. These assets resulting from client financing and trading activity generally are shorter term and have a lower net interest yield than core banking assets. The net interest yield excluding global markets increased 12 basis points year-over-year to 2.95% driven by broad improvement in asset yields relative to funding costs. Moving back to total NII, Q2 GAAP NII increased modestly versus Q1 as the benefits of higher interest rates and one extra day was offset by seasonal client activity in global markets and seasonal pay downs of credit card loans. An increase in three-month LIBOR rates from 1Q18, which impacts the cost of our long-term debt, also negatively impacted the comparison. With respect to deposit pricing, rate paid on total interest-bearing deposits rose 7 basis points from Q1 and is up 32 basis points versus 4Q15, which was the beginning of this Fed rate hike cycle. That compares to an average Fed funds rate which is up 27 basis points and 151 basis points respectively from 1Q18 and 4Q15, so to date in this cycle we have passed through on interest-bearing deposits roughly 21% of the increase in Fed funds. Turning to asset sensitivity, as of 6/30, an instantaneous 100 basis point parallel increase in rates is estimated to increase NII by $2.8 billion over the subsequent 12 months. This is modestly lower than our sensitivity on 3/31 driven by cash deployed to securities, which increases future NII. Note that the short end represents about 70% of this sensitivity. Turning to Slide 12, we had another solid quarter of expense management, extending our record of year-over-year quarterly decreases in expense to 14 out of the last 15 quarters. Non-interest expense of $3.3 billion was down $698 million or 5% year-over-year. As I mentioned earlier, 2Q17 included roughly $300 million in impairment associated with data centers that we sold, so excluding that charge, expense still declined nearly $400 million or 3% with broad improvements across most categories. I would emphasize that we achieved this reduction while continuing to invest in new technology, new financial centers, and sales staff. With respect to sales professionals, we continue to add relationship bankers in consumer, business banking and commercial, as well as financial advisors in wealth management. Notably, despite adding sales professionals, our headcount is down roughly 3,000 from last year as we reduce non-client facing roles by streamlining how we work and deliver for customers. During the quarter, we also on-boarded more than 2,500 summer interns. These interns were selected from nearly 50,000 applicants. This year\u2019s class is our most diverse group ever; for example, women make up 45% of these interns and 55% are ethnically or racially diverse. Turning to the business segments and starting with consumer banking on Slide 13, another great quarter for this business as client balances grew, revenues increases, and expenses were down. Key metrics suggest a healthy consumer and a strong U.S. economic growth. Jobs and wages are improving, tax reform put more money in consumers\u2019 pockets, and equity markets are healthy and creating wealth. These types of improvements are fueling higher spending and more borrowing, and we believe we are gaining share and deepening relationships in this growing economy. Earnings in consumer banking increased to $2.9 billion, returning 31% on allocated capital. This is the 12th consecutive quarter that earnings in consumer banking have increased year-over-year. Consumer banking created over 850 basis points of operating leverage this quarter as revenue grew 8% while expenses were down. The efficiency ratio has improved more than 400 basis points in the past 12 months and is now below 48%. Year-over-year, average loans grew 7%, average deposits grew 5%, and Merrill Edge brokerage assets grew 20%. As rates rose and given our solid growth in client balances, the value of our deposits drove an 8% improvement in revenue year-over-year. Cost of deposits, which reflects non-interest expense as a percent of average deposits, improved to 155 basis points. Rate paid remained at 5 basis points. Net charge-offs increased $105 million from 2Q17 as our credit card portfolio grows and continues to season. Net charge-off ratio remained low at 128 basis points, up only 7 basis points from 2Q17. Provision expense increased $110 million from 2Q17, in line with the increase in net charge-offs. Turning to Slide 14 and key trends, looking first at revenue, we believe relationship deepening is driving improvement in revenue, predominantly NII. This quarter, our revenue growth of 8% year-over-year included 11% growth in NII as well as higher revenue in card income and service charges. Spending levels on debt and credit cards were up 8% year-over-year, driving the increase in card income. Service charges grew modestly. Customer satisfaction in consumer banking reached a new high with roughly 81% of our clients rating us 9 or 10 on a 10-point scale. Focusing on client balances on the bottom of the page, we continued to grow deposits, loans, and brokerage assets. With respect to loans, in addition to growth in residential mortgage, card balances grew 5% year-over-year and Merrill Edge assets grew 20%. Edge offers customers a lot of value and is a great way for us to deepen relationships. Whether it is access to one of our 4,000 licensed advisors and a world-leading research platform or how integrated Edge is with other banking needs, we think customers are noticing and giving us more of their investment dollars. Expenses were down slightly compared to 2Q17 as productivity improvements more than offset the continued investment in financial center renovations and technology initiatives. We continue to modernize financial centers and add new ones. This quarter, we opened 13 new financial centers and renovated another 65. Turning to global wealth and investment management on Slide 15, GUM produced another quarter of solid results, nearing the record $1 billion of net income earned in Q1 and producing the second highest pre-tax margin ever at 28%. Strong client activity and a healthy equity market coupled with solid expense management all benefited results. Growth in households and deepening of relationships is helping offset industry dynamics driven by consumer behaviors. Strong AUM flows and market appreciation increased AUM balances, driving a 10% increase in asset management fees. This was offset by lower brokerage revenue and modestly lower NII. The NII reduction from 2Q17 reflects lower deposit levels as well as higher rates paid on deposits. Additionally, brokerage revenue decreased as volumes declined and mix shifted toward fee-based products. As a result of this shift, the percentage of GUM revenue derived from annuitized revenue streams has increased over the last year to more than 85%. The business managed costs well, creating operating leverage. Moving to Slide 16, we continue to see strong overall client engagement in Merrill Lynch and U.S. Trust. Our local market strategy led by 93 market presidents is helping to better integrate our lines of business and deepen relationships, especially in wealth management. Merrill Lynch advisors reacted constructively to our 2018 compensation program, which incentivizes household and other types of responsible organic growth. Merrill Lynch\u2019s organic household acquisition has not been this high for at least five years. Competitive advisor attrition remains near historic lows. Year-over-year, client balances rose to record levels of nearly $2.8 trillion, driven by higher market values, solid AUM flows, and continued low growth. AUM balances, which have climbed to over $1.1 trillion, are up $110 billion versus 2Q17 with flows contributing $74 billion of that increase. Average loans of $161 billion grew 7% year-over-year with continued strength in consumer real estate and structured lending. Turning to Slide 17, global banking earned just over $2 billion, growing 16% from 2Q17 and generating a 20% return on allocated capital. Revenue was down 2% from 2Q17 as an increase in NII from traditional corporate banking activities and higher rates was more than offset by lower investment banking fees and the impact of tax reform with respect to tax advantaged investments. Absent the impact of tax reform, the business would have created modest revenue growth and operating leverage. IB fees of $1.4 billion for the overall firm declined 7% year-over-year driven by lower advisory fees from a record quarter a year ago. Expenses were relatively flat versus 2Q17 despite our continued investment in additional client-facing professionals to enhance local market coverage. Global banking average loans grew 3% and deposits 8% year-over-year. Looking at trends on Slide 18 and comparing to Q2 last year, with respect to average loans, 3% growth was led by corporate banking lending in international regions. Core loan portfolio spreads were down 5 basis points year-over-year and 1 basis point versus Q1. Loan growth was solid and reflects the current economic environment but remains very competitive. Average deposits rose $23 billion or 8% compared to 2Q17 as we maintain a targeted pricing approach to acquire and retain high quality deposits. Switching to global markets on Slide 19 and 20, I will talk about results excluding DBA. Global markets generated revenue of $4.4 billion and earned $1.3 billion, producing a return on allocated capital of 14%. Earnings were up 35% as revenue growth outpaced expense increases from higher revenue-led costs and continued technology investments. Sales and trading grew 7% versus 2Q17 to $3.6 billion. Our equity business led the improvement with revenue of $1.3 billion, up 17% year-over-year. The equities business benefited from increases in client financing activity, reflecting investments made in the business over the past 18 months. Equity derivatives also benefited from increased client activity driven by volatility in financial markets. Fixed sales and trading of $2.3 billion increased 2%. In general, improved performance across macro-related products was partially offset by weakness in credit products. On Slide 21, we show all other, which reported a net loss of $247 million. This is an improvement from 2Q17 of $98 million. All of the selected items reviewed at the start of this presentation except DBA and global markets were recorded in all other, and therefore impacted both revenue and expense comparisons. If you remember the two items in 2Q18, the TRUPS and the gain from the sale of non-core mortgages netted to a negative $160 million, while the sale of U.K. card increased revenue in 2Q17 by nearly $800 million. This nearly $1 billion year-over-year swing drove the $1.2 billion change in revenue. Non-interest expense improved $760 million year-over-year and includes the 2Q18 data center impairment charge as well as broad improvements across other expenses. Remember, when comparing income tax expense between periods, the tax expense in 2Q17 included the nearly $700 million tax impact of the U.K. card sale, which offset the revenue benefit. Let me turn it back to Brian for a couple of closing comments before we open it up for Q&A. Brian Moynihan : Thanks Paul. Just a couple thoughts to close and then we\u2019ll take your questions. We continue to operate in a strong business environment led by consumer health, corporate profits, and a view of growth in the future. We\u2019ve performed well in this environment and feel we are getting our fair share of the business. We continue to drive strong operating leverage for the 14th quarter in a row and we grew, but we did it in a responsible manner, keeping our risk in check. Customer balances, earnings, they all grew as we cited earlier. We report earnings which have been stronger and more consistent for many years now, and with that consistency and stability, we continue to produce that operating leverage, which plays to your benefit as shareholders. With that, let me turn it over for questions and answers. Operator : [Operator instructions] We\u2019ll take our first question from John McDonald with Bernstein. Please go ahead, your line is open. John McDonald : Hey guys. Wanted to ask about expenses, which came in a little better than expected this quarter. Brian, how should we think about the $500 million technology investment that you mentioned in the press release over the next few quarters, and what\u2019s it mean for the target of approximately $53 billion in expenses this year and also your ability to keep expenses flattish into \u201919 and \u201920, which you\u2019ve previously talked about? Brian Moynihan : Thanks John. We, along with a lot of other companies, announced $1,000 bonuses, we announced a share for success plan, and then on top of that we\u2019ve stepped up investment in opportunities that we have. It\u2019s basically $75 million a quarter from now until the end of next year. We expect to manage a lot of that through self-funding, for lack of a better term, by continuing to improve of our expenses what we\u2019ve seen, so you should think in the $53 billion, low $53 billion range this quarter and keeping it relatively flat, and we\u2019re going to work this self-funded. But in any event, it will be $75 million a quarter in expenses, but when you add it all up, it\u2019s a major step in investing in our company due to the benefits from tax reform. John McDonald : Got it, and then beyond this year, kind of staying, like you said, flattish in that same ballpark is the goal for next year and possibly beyond as well? Brian Moynihan : Yes, the idea is for \u201919 and \u201920, we\u2019ve told you on many occasions that we expect to maintain flattish over the next couple years beyond \u201918. John McDonald : Okay. Paul, wanted to ask about the card losses. What kind of pace of seasoning do you see in the credit card book over the next couple quarters as that continues to grow? Paul Donofrio : Pace of seasoning? Look - I guess a couple of thoughts. One, I think you have to remember that 2Q is sort of the highest quarter seasonally for card losses, right? We\u2019re sort of at 3.17, and if you back out the hurricane, we\u2019re at kind of 3.09. So yes, I would expect that kind of a range as your look out the next couple of quarters, and that would reflect seasoning and loan growth in the card portfolio in that number. John McDonald : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Then just more broadly, credit at the top of the house in terms of the run rate around charge-offs and provisions, you also expect stability in the near term? Paul Donofrio : Yes. In Q3, we expect credit to continue to perform well. I mean, we would expect provision to be roughly in line with net charge-offs with reserve releases moderating over time as we continue to build allowance in support of loan growth, particularly in card. As we just talked about, our card portfolio is seasoning and I would expect sort of an upward bias in NCOs; but again, remember as you think about that, Q2 is the highest quarter in cards, usually. I would also remind you that NCOs can be a little lumpy in commercial, since we\u2019re at the bottom, but everything--when you look at all the metrics, NPLs, 30-plus day delinquencies, reservable criticized, they are all going in the right direction, and they are really our leading indicators on the portfolio and they\u2019re all pointing to a very strong environment and a very strong portfolio. John McDonald : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Glenn Schorr : Hi, thanks very much. I want to ask an NII question, and I saw the comments on ex-global markets, the net interest yield being up 12 basis points, deposit betas are good, so the core business that we all focus on is good. I do want to talk about the actual pick-up in wholesale funding costs, because the yield up 49 basis points on Fed funds purchased is big. I know it\u2019s a steeping of the short end, but the question I have is, is that something that we should expect to be with us throughout this rate hike cycle if the short end of the curve keeps steepening? Is it something that you\u2019re able to hedge, because it does make a pretty big difference in NII. Paul Donofrio : Are you talking about the increase in the cost of our long-term debt quarter over quarter? Brian Moynihan : Fed funds, Fed funds. Glenn Schorr : Fed funds, wholesale funding side. Page 9 of the supplement has the average balances. Brian Moynihan : Just think of it--it\u2019s matched book, so it moves together pretty quickly due to the fact it\u2019s all short term, both on the liability side and then they\u2019re long assets, but they price up as the curve moves. But there\u2019s some stuff in the second quarter that we usually have there, that is the dividend transactions and things like that, which affect it, so I\u2019d pay attention to it next quarter. You might see it settle in a little bit more like it traditionally does. Glenn Schorr : Okay, that\u2019s good, because the flattening out on total net interest income is really that, as opposed to the core business, that\u2019s why it\u2019s more important than usual now? Brian Moynihan : Yes. Glenn Schorr : Okay, and then just one question on advisory. Year-to-date, you guys have lagged peers some. I don\u2019t know if you feel that\u2019s a couple of a big deals or a sector or two that you want to deepen coverage in. I\u2019m just curious to get your thoughts on advisory. Brian Moynihan : Oh, the M&A advisory fees? I think it is. It is, just sometimes you get the right side of a deal, sometimes you get the wrong side of a deal, sometimes you\u2019re not in a deal. But even though we performed solidly in line with the fee pools and stuff year-over-year, we know we can do a better job there and the team is working on it. We had a record quarter in the second quarter last year, and so the $1.4 billion level is more in line with quarters across time, second quarters. But the team knows they can do a better job and are after it. Glenn Schorr : All right, thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead. Jim Mitchell : Hey, good morning. Maybe just talk a little bit about loan growth, what you\u2019re seeing. Obviously the [indiscernible] has been showing signs of life. Are you seeing that as well, and how do you think about that going forward in terms of your outlook for loan growth? Paul Donofrio : First off, I guess our perspective is customers are optimistic given tax reform, the economy is strong, and confidence feels high, so customers are going to react differently to those factors near term - some may pay down debt from tax savings or repatriation, but some are going to invest and borrow. In large corporates, growth in any one quarter can bounce around a little depending on acquisition financing, so having said all that, our near-term expectation on loan growth remains unchanged. We still expect total loan growth to be low single digits at the top of the house, if you exclude the headwinds from the run-off of the non-core mortgage book and all other, growth within the business segments should be mid single digits. I would also note in the slide deck, year-over-year growth has been relatively consistent now over the past couple of years. If you look at the different categories, you want a little bit more color, we anticipate modest growth in consumer loans. On car, we\u2019ve seen mid single digit year-over-year growth which has modestly increased over the last couple of quarters. With respect to consumer real estate, originations are solid and balances are growing well, but there are headwinds continuing from the run-off from the non-core portfolio; and remember, we\u2019re booking 90% of our mortgages now on the balance sheet. I mentioned in the remarks that we expect auto growth to be flat to down as we focus on organic growth and rely less on third party, and note that in all of these categories, we\u2019re very focused and remain focused on prime and super-prime. Jim Mitchell : So you\u2019re not seeing any real acceleration yet? Paul Donofrio : I wouldn\u2019t say we\u2019ve seen acceleration. I think it\u2019s been consistent growth. You know, we have a pretty diverse set of clients that we service. In any one quarter, one may accelerate more than the other. If you look at this quarter, we saw really good growth in small business, we saw good growth in structured lending and GUM, so in any quarter we might see growth but it always seems to average out of at that sort of mid single digit level. Jim Mitchell : Okay, and as we think about in that context deposit growth slowing, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a large impact from the TRUPS, how do you think about--and your rates on [indiscernible], how do we think about NII growth going forward given the implied curve today? Paul Donofrio : Yes, well we will clearly benefit from the June rate hike, Q3 is going to have an extra day, and we\u2019re also going to benefit from expected loan and deposit growth, but these benefits are going to be offset by rate increases on deposits. As you know, we\u2019ve been increasing rates in GUM and global banking. The issue is we just don\u2019t know when we will increase in consumer. It\u2019s going to depend on the competitive environment, so it\u2019s probably a little misleading for me to give you all of you some sort of numerical guidance as we just don\u2019t know the timing of any increase in consumer. Having said that, year-over-year we\u2019re up a billion dollars in the first half. Jim Mitchell : Okay, fair enough. Thanks. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good morning. Brian Moynihan : Morning, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : A couple questions. One is on deposit betas and getting a little bit more color there. I know you mentioned in the prepared remarks the overall deposit beta. Can you give us a sense as to where you think you are in the commercial, the wealth, the consumer buckets? I\u2019m just trying to get an understanding of which buckets are higher than others, and do you see an acceleration in any of these specific buckets from here? Brian Moynihan : I think, Betsy, the customer base has performed very differently depending on what the cash is used for. If it\u2019s transactional cash, whether it\u2019s a consumer or whether it\u2019s a wealth customer or a company, they\u2019re using that money and it\u2019s in the flow, and therefore the rate side of it is not as important as you\u2019re paying for service on the commercial side, or the consumer side just the cash flow getting out of the household. If you look at it on the investment side, obviously all segments when they have the access cash that they don\u2019t need to conduct their daily business moves, and so if you look at our pricing strategies across businesses that Paul talked about earlier, you see them differentiated not only by business but also by market and sub-markets within business, and so if you look at the powerful engine and the trillion-plus of deposits, $1.3 trillion, consumer is nearly $680 billion of it, and of that $300 billion-plus is checking, which moves very slowly because it\u2019s transactional. The good news in consumer is we\u2019ve grown number of checking accounts for the first time in the last six or eight quarters consistently due to all the repositioning we\u2019re doing with accounts, and the average balance has gone up and are all checking, so that is very beneficial for us going forward. So without getting into all the numbers, and Paul can hit that, you just have to think philosophically, half that balance in consumer or checking are not going to move much, and the rest of it is money market and will move as the market moves and competition moves. We\u2019ve been able to maintain discipline on that side and generate another $30 billion-odd of year-over-year deposit growth, which is pretty good, and that\u2019s all core market share gains because we\u2019re not doing CDs and other stuff. Then on the institutional corporate side, we\u2019ve moved it, and Paul gave you some of the statistics. For commercial side, obviously the highest end moves fastest, and yet we\u2019ve been able to maintain growth in balances while still maintaining discipline on pricing. Betsy Graseck : Okay, and you spoke to the non-consumer side growing nicely. What about on the commercial side, are you seeing a shift from NIB to fees, or are you holding your NIB in the commercial group? Paul Donofrio : Well, most of the deposit growth in global banking has been in interest-bearing deposits, so we are definitely seeing a shift there from non-interest bearing to interest bearing. Brian Moynihan : But it\u2019s very different by business, so in the business banking segment, it\u2019s five to one non-interest bearing to interest bearing, and then when you get to corporate, it\u2019s more interest bearing than non-interest bearing. So again, it differs by the type of customer it is too. Betsy Graseck : Yes, okay, but I guess part of the point you\u2019re making is that that\u2019s in the run rate already? Brian Moynihan : Yes, and so the point is that you\u2019ll see--that\u2019s the thing. If you go back since the tightening started in \u201915 and think about the global scheme of things here, you can see those tightening moves across, that you see what\u2019s happened with the deposit rates. They\u2019ll continue to move, but you back that all [indiscernible] you still see the asset sensitivity just under $3 billion for 100 basis point rise, 70% is in the short term, and that takes all the stuff we\u2019re talking about and puts it into the forward curve assumptions. Betsy Graseck : The checking accounts that you\u2019re growing on the consumer side, do you see that more in your branch expansion areas or is that more in your, for lack of a better word, legacy footprint? Brian Moynihan : It has to be in the legacy, because the expansion footprint is so small. When you think about it, it\u2019s digital sales, it\u2019s in the legacy footprint, it\u2019s deeper relationship management. But we\u2019ve grown those checking account numbers at the same time the primary percentages kept moving up. We\u2019re now at 91% of the primary checking account in the household and the average balance has grown also, so think about that dynamic - a higher average balance, primary households going up, and growing the number and it has to be in the core franchise. There\u2019s not enough new branches out there to make a difference when you have the size of franchise we do. Betsy Graseck : Got it. Then just lastly, can you remind on the pace of the branch expansion over the next year or two? I know it\u2019s a four-year forward that you announced, but just try to understand rate of change here over the next year or two. Brian Moynihan : About 500 over the next four years has been, and so you saw some of that dynamic this quarter. It picks up because literally just getting locations set and getting a build out, so you\u2019ll see it pick-up over the next several quarters, but it takes about four years to get to them all. Thirteen this quarter, to give you a sense, so it will pick up as we move forward. Betsy Graseck : Got it, okay. Thanks Brian. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead. Gerard, check your mute function please on your phone. We\u2019ll go next to Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead, your line is open. Ken Usdin : Thanks, good morning. If I could follow up a little bit more on that lower right part of the funding side, Paul, can you walk us through the benefits you expect from trust preferred redemption and if you are going to have to refinance that, and what would be the net benefit as you think about that and forward NII? Paul Donofrio : Sure, so just a reminder everybody, these securities are becoming just expensive funding at this point. I think you all know, they no longer count as capital under the fully phased-in rules, nor do they count at TLAC, so while there are a number of things to think about if you\u2019re going to call them, the primary focus was on the one-timer from loss relative to the ongoing lower interest expense that you are alluding to. If you think about that ongoing benefit, we think the savings are going to be roughly $140 million per year or $35 million-ish per quarter. Ken Usdin : Do you have any need to refinance or is that a net of any incremental funding as a swap, or is this going to be a net nice benefit? Paul Donofrio : That assumes we\u2019re refinancing. Ken Usdin : That\u2019s a net? Okay. Paul Donofrio : But again, to be clear, we\u2019re not refinancing with preferreds. We\u2019re refinancing with bank debt or unsecured senior debt. Ken Usdin : That\u2019s what I meant - just the replacement financing for getting rids of the higher cost TRUPS. Paul Donofrio : Yes, that estimate I gave you assumes we refinance in an efficient way. Ken Usdin : Okay. Then also, you mentioned the market impact on long-term debt. Did we see any of that 30-90 day disconnect still come through on average this quarter, and do you expect that to get better as we go forward from here? Paul Donofrio : Yes, we did see it this quarter. There was a quarter over quarter increase in long-term debt yields - they were up, I think, around 38 basis points, and that\u2019s driven by the spot increase in three-month LIBOR from January to April as most of our debt is swapped to floating and resets in the first month of the quarter. So it\u2019s about what the rates are at that moment in terms of understanding the increase in the cost of the debt. We\u2019re thinking about that. We\u2019re working on different ways that we can align what happens on our loans, which are mostly one month LIBOR too, what happens on our liabilities with mostly three-month LIBOR, so more to come on that. Ken Usdin : Okay, because that was going to be my final question, is just what can you do to arrest the increase, to Glenn\u2019s point before, of those three bottom lines on the lower right side of the liability side, which are moving far faster than any deposit beta? Paul Donofrio : Yes. Ken Usdin : Okay, so we\u2019ll wait and see. Thanks Paul. Paul Donofrio : Yes, we\u2019re working on that. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Mike Mayo : Hi. You said the average checking account size is up. It\u2019s gone from what to what? Brian Moynihan : Depends upon a time frame, but it\u2019s moved up over the last three or four years, Mike, from average size of--so if you want to go from \u201914 to now, it\u2019s gone from $5,000 to $7,500, and in the last year it\u2019s gone from $7,000 to $7,500. Mike Mayo : Okay, so does that help keep the deposit betas lower for longer? I guess if you were to offer 1% less in interest, what are we talking about here, $75 a year? In terms of that $75 of what someone might give up, they get all the mobile banking and online checking and everything else? Is that how we should think about it? Brian Moynihan : I think there\u2019s lots of trade-offs consumers make, but this is the money going in and out of their checking account on a given day, so you\u2019re growing the average balance, the $7,500 between our preferred and our retail segment, they\u2019d be different each segment, but this is money in motion, for lack of a better term, Mike, as you\u2019re thinking about it, so to move it around very carefully has implications if they don\u2019t keep the balances there if a payment hits or something like that. It\u2019s pretty sticky in terms of balances, but the key is when you think about the consumer overall, it\u2019s as a percentage of total consumer deposits it is nearing half of that in checking, either interest-bearing checking, which is low cost, or non-interest bearing. That\u2019s the key. That\u2019s what\u2019s driving the checking growth, it\u2019s not coming from CDs or other types of high cost deposits driving the total deposit growth. Mike Mayo : Then consumer efficiency, consumer banking efficiency ratio of 48%, I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s the lowest in history, but maybe that\u2019s good news, bad news. That was our forecast for you to hit three years from now, and you\u2019re here in the second quarter, so is that kind of front-loaded? Should we expect that to stay at 48% or can you improve a lot more, and if so, where? Brian Moynihan : Mike, as you know, we don\u2019t sit there and say 48 is great and let\u2019s stop. We say, how do you improve the operating effectiveness, so I think if you look at that, they\u2019ll continue to work to improve it. They\u2019ve done it as they generate more NII, which drives their business model, as you\u2019re well aware. A little of that on a same expense base makes a heck of a turn, and if you think about, 850 basis points of operating leverage year-over-year matched quarter is pretty effective, so it\u2019s a combination of all those investments I talked about earlier coming true and the efficiency embedded in that, the combination of more sales digital and efficiency embedded in the sales process, because this 48% counts everything, and a combination of continuing to grow in checking accounts and the deposit balances, which are the highest potential revenue growth product forum in the short term with a big business like that. You\u2019ve got to remember, that business made $2.8 billion after-tax this quarter, which makes it one of the biggest companies in America. Mike Mayo : One last follow-up. With all the digital banking expansion, are you looking to ramp up your marketing spend? Your marketing spend did not increase, at least in contrast to some of your peers, and the thought there is as you relate to customers less with branches, more with digital, maybe you want more support from a marketing standpoint, but that at least is not showing through in your expense numbers. Brian Moynihan : Yes, what you see as marketing is a representation of bought marketing, paid for, all that type of stuff. But remember that the integration of the customer information, the platforms we use, is a very efficient way to market, and so especially going for the stair-step deepening on our own clients, we know what we know about the clients and the messages that go out to the branches to set up calls with Brian Moynihan because has a need, etc., are driving it. That\u2019s not expensive and it\u2019s not necessarily what people see in the marketing and line item. It\u2019s comes through the talent and teammates that we have in our data information group, which is thousands of teammates that work on this every day, so it\u2019s more in the personnel line than it is in the marketing line, Mike, if you see what I mean. Mike Mayo : So it\u2019s kind of geography in one sense? Brian Moynihan : Yes, but it\u2019s about, all told, I think 35, 40% of the sales transactions are initiated by a marketing lead, for lack of a better term, driven by analytics into the branch system or into the digital experience. Mike Mayo : All right, thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Matt O\u2019Connor: Good morning. Brian Moynihan : Good morning, Matt. How are you? Matt O\u2019Connor: Good, thank you. Just circling back on net interest income, as we think about the outlook, it seems like there\u2019s some positives in the sense of the lower debt costs and some of the things that you alluded to. Obviously there\u2019s also expectations that deposit betas pick up. When we put it all together, if you care to provide some more detailed guidance on the net interest income outlook, that might be helpful. Paul Donofrio : Look - I guess the best guidance I can give you is our asset sensitivity, which again there\u2019s $2.8 billion for 100 basis point move with 70% of that on the short end. As you know, that modeling includes a 50% pass-through rate, so as I said before, we have some nice tailwinds in this quarter, and going into year end, we\u2019ve got the rate hike, we\u2019ve got the extra day, and we\u2019re going to see loan and deposit growth, but that\u2019s going to be offset by whatever happens on the deposit side. Again, the best guidance I can give you is just look at our asset sensitivity. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay. I mean, I guess the asset sensitivity--you know, we\u2019ve had rates move up more than expected the last few quarters, and obviously there is some one-offs in the net interest income, but it hasn\u2019t been a very good guide the last few quarters. NII has been relatively flat and obviously rates have been quite favorable, so. Paul Donofrio : We\u2019ve grown quarter over quarter $660 million, first half of the year I think it\u2019s $1.2 billion on a GAAP basis. I\u2019m not going to sit here and tell you to double that because we just don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen on rate paid; but to your point, in parts of our business, in the consumer business we haven\u2019t increased rates materially but we are increasing rates in GUM and in global banking. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay. Just separately, if we looked at the credit card fees, those came in better at least than I had been looking for. I know there is, I think, still a drag in the year-over-year comps from the U.K. sale, a little bit there, so just talk a bit about maybe what\u2019s going better there, and I think you had some new product offerings as well that recently came out. Paul Donofrio : Yes, in 2Q17, we did have a small non-operating charge, so I wouldn\u2019t use this quarter over quarter, year over year growth rate as the growth rate going forward. More generally, we\u2019re seeing growth in our card balances and we think that\u2019s going to continue in 2018 as we add new accounts at a healthy pace. We\u2019ve seen combined credit and debit card spend, as you know, is up - I think it\u2019s up 8% year-over-year, but that card line does face headwinds from competition around rewards, and as you know, we are focused on total revenue. We\u2019re not focused on any one line item, we\u2019re focused on total revenue and delivering for our clients. We\u2019re focused on attracting relatively high quality card customers and then rewarding them for deepening their overall relationship with us, and we think that strategy is driving incremental deposit growth, making our deposits more sticky. It also lowers our costs because those people tend to interact less with the bank. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay, thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Saul Martinez with UBS. Please go ahead. Saul Martinez : Hey, good morning. On NII, Paul, obviously part of the lack of clarity around the NII guide is in part due to the uncertainty around retail deposit beta, and on the consumer side where you haven\u2019t seen much, if anything, in terms of deposit rates moving up. But is there anything that gives you pause that we are nearing a tipping point, any changes on the margin in consumer behavior? Are you starting to see, for example, any migration or sense that there will be migration out of non-interest bearing into higher yielding instruments? Just curious if there is anything that gives you pause that maybe we will start to see deposit costs move up, because it\u2019s obviously not showing up in the numbers in any meaningful way just yet. Paul Donofrio : Yes, well the short answer, the very short answer is there\u2019s nothing that gives us pause. The longer answer is as [indiscernible] look at every part of the United States and every MSA and looks at our competitors, so we notice activity, we see people testing this or that in a given market. But so far, we don\u2019t see anything that gives us any concern, and again--I don\u2019t want to go over it again, but I think you all have to remember what consumers value is not just [indiscernible] them, they value the entire relationship, they value the nationwide network, they value the mobile ability, the safety, the transparency. They value preferred rewards - we give them more when they deposit more with us, so the whole thing--you know, that\u2019s part of the whole equation. But the short answer is we just really haven\u2019t seen anything so far that would make us think things are going to change rapidly, but we\u2019ll see. Saul Martinez : Okay. No, that\u2019s helpful. If I could also just ask a follow-up question on the increase in funding costs on the Fed funds, you mentioned--if you could clarify what you mean by settle in. Should we interpret that as remaining at the current 2.15%, or is that to suggest that there should be some sort of normalization in 3Q and a bit of a tick down in the funding cost line there? Paul Donofrio : I think the way you think about--you guys are obviously looking at something in the supplement, but the way I would think about funding costs is in global markets, which I think is what this is boiling into, in global markets when we grow equities, as we\u2019ve been growing equities, the dividends we receive on equities, the fees we receive from trading equities, that\u2019s all in trading com profits. But if you\u2019re growing equities, you have to pay for that, so that\u2019s in the interest expense. In addition if you look at FIC, as rates rise, you\u2019ve got to pay for that as well, your cost to fund FIC goes up, and most o four inventory is bonds which are fixed rate, so your NII does not go up right away until those bonds get replaced. As rates rise, you\u2019re going to see that phenomenon affect our global markets NII, but we\u2019ve seen the improvement in trading and com profits. I mean, equities is up 17% this quarter, year-to-date equities is up, how much - 24, 28%? So you know, it shows up--it\u2019s geography. Saul Martinez : Got it, so it\u2019s trading-related NII, but what we\u2019re looking at is Page 9 in the supplement - you know, the cost went to $1,462 million versus $1,135, and it\u2019s a sequential increase of about 49 basis points. But it sounds like it\u2019s related to the global markets side, as you said. Okay, thank you. Brian Moynihan : That\u2019s where it comes from. Paul Donofrio : Look - the only other phenomenon this quarter is in credit card, right? You have the phenomenon of people paying down their card balances because they get tax refunds, and if you look at the credit card portfolio, that means that transactors, the people who borrow money from us inter-period, they\u2019re a bigger portion of it. So I think those are the two phenomena that impacted NII in the second quarter that are seasonal, that it happens every year. If you go back year after year after year, you saw this phenomenon from 1Q to 2Q. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Nancy Bush with NAB Research. Please go ahead. Nancy Bush : Good morning, gentlemen. A couple of questions for you here, the first one on digital usage. It seems to be sort of accelerating beyond a pace at which even you expected, and I\u2019m wondering if you have the ability to sort of look at digital usage by age, segment, etc. Are there any variations from what you expected early on, are we seeing more usage not just by millennials, and has the pace of digital usage sort of altered your expectations for branch expansion over the next few years? Brian Moynihan : I think, Nancy, what you\u2019re pointing out is the common theory is that this is all young kids, but there\u2019s not enough young kids in anybody\u2019s customer base to drive this kind of activity, so it has broadened out dramatically. When you have 75% of the checks are deposited in ATM or through the mobile device, that is 75% of all the checks written that consumers deposited with Bank of America, so it\u2019s across the board; whereas something like digital - Erica, obviously the cohort is younger just because people, their familiarity with a voice activated, artificial intelligence assistant and the usage of it. By different types of things, you see different activity, but you have sales of mortgage or auto definitely also skew higher in age because the nature of people who are buying homes and cars, so it\u2019s really across the board. I think what you\u2019re pointing out is really the difference between now and five years ago or 10 years ago, where the activity conducted by grandparents on mobile phones is high, and so as I always told the story, we had a 100-year-old person who became mobile enabled a couple years ago, which I think is tremendous optimism, but it\u2019s across the board and that is the difference. Then the usage of it is integrated high touch, high tech, so there\u2019s still people--you know, there\u2019s still talent, teammates taking $50 million business to the branch a quarter and doing a great job with them, and we\u2019re driving people to branches for relationship management at the same time we\u2019re doing other things with their devices, so it is absolutely a combined set of capabilities and you\u2019re looking across all of them. What that means in branch expansion, what we\u2019re doing is retooling and outfitting branches and ATMs, so we\u2019re getting all the ATMs will have the ability to cash checks to the penny, which is important to actually use that as a payment device, and expanding the branches and markets we aren\u2019t in doesn\u2019t cost a lot from marketing. We went digitally first in Pittsburgh, for example, which is a different way to go about it, due to the fact that we already have a nationwide brand and customers there in Merrill and U.S. Trust in the credit card, and mortgage customers from the past, so we can drive that. You would expect that it will have implications for the branches, but remember in the branches, even though we\u2019ve come down another 100-odd year over year, the numbers of people in them are going up, and that means that they\u2019re bigger stores, bigger destinations, less about on the corner transactions. At the same time, they\u2019re tremendously important in the community, so we continue to develop our community-based branches in markets which tend to need more face-to-face help. So all that together, it\u2019s a complex thing, but at the end of the day when you put it all together, we made $2.8 billion after tax, 48% efficiency ratio, deposits grew by $35 billion year-over-year, $26 billion of which was checking, to give you a sense, which relies on all those great capabilities to fuel it and why we think we\u2019re taking share. Nancy Bush : So I guess what you\u2019re saying--I mean, there has been a tendency in the industry to look at digital versus branch as sort of an either-or proposition, and you\u2019re saying that that\u2019s not necessarily correct at this point? Brian Moynihan : Yes, a half million people went to their mobile device, set up an appointment and came into the branch, another million responded to calls, and 50 million people walked in, and yet we had a 1.4 billion log in, so you start thinking about it, it\u2019s an absolutely integrated experience and a competitive advantage to have both. I think that plays out generally in retail and I think it plays out in financial services. All during this time, Nancy, the other key thing to remember is customer satisfaction scores, which you and I have talked about for a long time, continue to go up and are at all-time highs even when we\u2019re making changes in the branches sometimes, which cause customers to recognize a change in the basic system, either closing a branch and consolidating it or how the drive-ups work and things like that. Nancy Bush : Okay. Yes, my follow-on is also on a note of expectation versus reality. There has been an expectation, I think in the industry, that there was going to be a quarter or quarters in which the credit quality environment changed dramatically, and it\u2019s been an expectation about CRE, etc. etc. I guess you said that your charge-off ratio had been under 50 basis points for, what, 15 of the last 17 quarters or something like that. Should we change our assumptions about a change in the credit quality environment? Are we in a new environment that\u2019s something we haven\u2019t seen before, where it\u2019s just consistent? Paul Donofrio : I think we can never--we are a bank, Nancy, as you well know, and therefore the general economy is always going to have an impact. The question is, have we positioned the company through our responsible growth work better than anybody else, and so we think we have. That means even if you hit an unexpected--which we don\u2019t expect to happen, and our consumer activity is the highest it\u2019s been in many years here. Payments by consumers are up 9% for the first half of the year versus last year, so everything shows as the consumer driven U.S. economy is in very good shape. You saw the retail sales numbers today, so all that bodes well for the 12, 24, whatever months, but given that we are creatures of economy, you\u2019re going to see us get affected by the economy if there\u2019s a recession, if there\u2019s a recession that we do not see coming in any near term. The way to think about that, though, relative to peers and relative to the industry overall, is you have the stress test, which is a hit the wall without any prior preparation into a very steep decline in the economy in a very short period of time, and you can see that each year our losses, so to speak, in that scenario keep coming down incrementally because the underlying quality of the credit that we do, and by the way we\u2019re not alone in the industry, we\u2019re better than the industry but we\u2019re not alone, and so I think the industry has done a great job of making sure we maintain--you know, keeping our head on our shoulders relative to credit. The core banking, stress test banks, you can see the statistics. Now, think about the last four or five years - oil and gas was going to be a problem, we put up a bunch of reserves, we ended up taking most of them back through. Commercial real estate was going to be a problem - we ended up going through that with very little loss and great recoveries last year, something like that. We don\u2019t do subprime - we let that play out in other people\u2019s. Auto loans were going to be a problem, you see that we haven\u2019t seen much change there. So are we underwriting to lower loss standards in good times than we did in prior generations? Yes, as our company, a difference in credit card, maybe underwriting at a normal 4% unemployment to 5.5% charge-offs versus now, we underwrite maybe 3, 3.5, and that\u2019s what you\u2019re seeing the normalization get to. That\u2019s the difference that\u2019s fundamentally different, but the real key was also to balance the portfolio so we didn\u2019t have so much unsecured credit card risk if we hit a cycle. So it\u2019s just the way we run the company, and you\u2019re seeing it--and it\u2019s 14 out of 17, not 15, but give us next quarter and we\u2019ll show you again. Nancy Bush : All right, thanks very much. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead. Marty Mosby : Thanks. Paul, wanted to ask you, everybody is talking about the flatness of the yield curve, but if you look at the three-month to two-year, you had talked about the pulling a little bit of your cash, that\u2019s the part of the yield curve that actually is pretty advantageous. You don\u2019t have to go out with duration actually to pick up 80, 90 basis points, so was that part of what your thinking was as you were kind of deploying some of that liquidity? Paul Donofrio : We\u2019re always thinking about the trade-offs between capital, liquidity and earnings, and when we--when securities mature in our portfolio or when we have extra cash to put to work, we\u2019re going to be looking at that yield curve and we\u2019re going to be trying to optimize that trade-off between liquidity, capital and earnings. So the answer is yes, we\u2019ve noticed what the yield curve looks like and we are investing appropriately. Marty Mosby : Then Brian, I\u2019ve got two more philosophical questions for you. One is as you\u2019ve come through all of the regulatory requirements and working through what issues you had coming out of the financial crisis, do you think Bank of America today is better prepared to be able to really fund economic growth as it looks out more than internal? Secondly, there\u2019s been turnover amongst the leaders or the business managers within our sector. When you first came in, you were kind of the new person on the block, and now you see yourself as--you know, you\u2019ve kind of been the one around almost the longest. Do you see yourself as taking more of a role as a pillar or a leader in the sector now that you have matured into your job? Brian Moynihan : I think I might just be getting old, Marty. Marty Mosby : We\u2019re all doing that. Brian Moynihan : I think the leaders of the major institutions, going to the dialog with Nancy just a few minutes ago, we take very seriously the requirement we have to drive the real economy, do it the right way, have it the right amount of capital and liquidity so nobody has to worry about our industry again, and I think a role personally as a leader in that, along with my colleagues, is critical, and we all see it that way. None of us are-we want fine tuning in regulation, we don\u2019t want it taken back to where it was, where people could make serious mistakes. We want the portfolios balanced, we want the capital and liquidity there, because at the end of the day under the FDIC scheme, we are a co-insurance for the activities of our industry and we take it very seriously. We\u2019ve had great leadership in our company with stability, and it\u2019s been a pleasure to serve with the teammates. I\u2019m in the ninth year now as CEO and we\u2019ve very little change for the last seven or eight years, other than people retiring, and we were just recognized as the best bank in the world, which is great for the teammates and an honor to receive it on behalf of them. That\u2019s, I think, the broader philosophical view, that we\u2019ll continue to help shape this industry at Bank of America, but I don\u2019t think my colleagues think differently, and I think we\u2019ve been through a lot to get here and learned a lot of lessons that will continue to apply. Marty Mosby : Thanks. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead. Gerard Cassidy : Good morning, Brian. Good morning, Paul. Brian Moynihan : Missed you the first time, Gerard. Gerard Cassidy : I know, I apologize - telephone problem. Brian, maybe you could share with us, you look at your returns on elevated capital by business line, and if you average them out, they come well over 22%. Obviously your stated return on equity is just over 10%. Clearly, the capital you guys are allocating to the business lines is less than the consolidated capital that you carry, so when I look at your tangible common equity, let\u2019s call it just under $200 billion, and the allocated capital is about $128 billion, have you had discussions with the regulators about--because I know it\u2019s CCAR constrained, you\u2019ve got operating risk as well. Have you talked about them what\u2019s the real need of capital for banks like yours in terms of the new guys that run these agencies, versus what it was like under the last administration? Brian Moynihan : Well, I think one thing you\u2019ve got to remember is goodwill is goodwill, it doesn\u2019t amortize, and so that $70 billion is going to be sort of stuck there. We run off maybe $100 million a quarter or something like that, it used to be a little bit more. The tangible common equity of a company in the mid-7s, Gerard, there was a day in the mid-2000s where we were running under 4 and I think touched 3, and maybe even under 3, so we have substantial tangible common equity. Going to Marty\u2019s question, that means that we will be, and likewise our colleagues, will be pillars of strength, so we obviously have some serious dialog as the right way to keep enterprises capitalized efficiently for safety and soundness. I think that if common equity Tier 1 is 11 and change, those are over-capitalized relative to our standard of 9.5. The problem we\u2019ve got is now you\u2019ve got this [indiscernible] buffer so you\u2019re trying to figure into the stress and capital buffer and all that stuff, and I think we keep needing to have a dialog with the industry and with the regulators to keep to getting to a middle of the road position here, because under-utilized capital is not the right thing. If we can get that capital back out in the system, it can be used to support someone else. That is actually good for the industry and also avoids and recognizes that running a business that has consistent loan growth of 5% really quarter after quarter after quarter versus the year before with the right credit is actually the right way to run it, so to make that all work, you\u2019ve got to let the capital out of the industry that isn\u2019t needed or earned and not needed to support growth. Meanwhile, I forgot to answer Marty\u2019s question. We are driving the real economy. There\u2019s no recently we have to do this - we\u2019ve been doing this for years, so if you look back and look at our commercial loan growth, it\u2019s been mid single digits, and our small business loan growth this quarter was very strong and has been for many quarters, as the team continues to drive it. But all that capital still doesn\u2019t equal all we have, and you\u2019re right - we need to keep that balance going, but let us keep working it now we\u2019ve got sort of a--you know, we\u2019ve sort of got a long term, everybody is at the capital standards, everybody has met them, everybody has met the 19 standards, etc., and we\u2019ve got to get through the last couple rules and then figure out how to manage the outcome to the right place. This company\u2019s industry is so much more strong than any other industry in the world relatively, and that will bode well for our country as we move through the next cycle. Gerard Cassidy : Following up, Brian, on the capital, clearly you had a good ask on the CCAR returns. Can you remind us where you think long term the dividend payout ratio can get to when you sit down with the board? Could it get to a 40% level? Brian Moynihan : Well, we have said 30%, and largely it\u2019s trying to figure out how all the rules and regulations work, and also where you\u2019ll never have to cut the dividend in times of stress and things like that. Let us get it up there and we\u2019ll figure out where it goes from there. Gerard Cassidy : Okay. Lastly, obviously you talked about the value of total relationships on your consumer side. You also talked about you\u2019re adding more customers with credit cards, households, brokerage house clients. Can you parse for us how much do you think you\u2019re taking away from other competitors just versus new people coming into the financial system? Do you have any idea what that is? Brian Moynihan : You can calculate it because the population growth and the shifting demographics, we are taking, we believe especially in the consumer bank, share, but at the end of the day, we\u2019re so big that we just have to grind out the growth through doing a great job. It inherently has to be slightly faster than the economy, slightly faster than the population growth, so we\u2019re taking share. But you\u2019ve got to remember, on the commercial side we\u2019re also increasing call it new logos, new clients through the expansion of relationship managers and the depth of those clients. I think that that takes time to build, and it\u2019s building up because of just the nature of moving a commercial relationship from X to Y company. But the combination of what we can do locally in all the markets with a combination of our global platform, our research team, our ability to talk across the world and our cash management platform, there\u2019s very few of us that can compete at that level and that will continue to play to our benefit. Increasingly with middle market investment banking, we\u2019ve added in the markets 50 of them so far, we\u2019re seeing tremendous--despite the fact that our overall investment banking fees bounce around, you\u2019re seeing the portion of it coming from that middle market client base is strong, and so we think we have a competitive advantage and we\u2019re just continuing to push that hard, including this additional $500 million in investments due to the benefits of tax reform. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll take today\u2019s final question from Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead, your line is open. Brian Kleinhanzl : Great, thanks. I just had one quick one, and a lot of them have been asked already. Is there a way that you could size what the runoff portfolio did quarter on quarter, so we can kind of get back to what the core loans did sequentially? Paul Donofrio : I\u2019m sorry, the run-off portfolio? Brian Kleinhanzl : Yes, within the loan book. You said you were still seeing some of the headwinds from the run-off portfolios coming down, but I didn\u2019t hear any dollar amounts what the size is now for the run-off portfolio. Brian Moynihan : It\u2019s been averaging about $3 billion to $4 billion per quarter, and it\u2019s in--you can actually see it in the deck, I think on Page 8. We break it out for you right there - we have total loans, then the run-off portfolio, then the business segments, and then we added this quarter so you could see the consistent year-over-year growth in loans we\u2019ve been experiencing. Brian Kleinhanzl : Okay, great. Thanks. Operator : That will conclude today\u2019s Q&A session. I will turn the floor back to Lee McIntyre for any closing remarks. Lee McIntyre : Thank you everyone for joining us. Another strong quarter - $6.8 billion in earnings. If you review Page 2 of the slide deck, you\u2019ll see it - we grew loans on a core basis and grew deposits on a core basis. We grew revenue on a core basis at 3% and we brought expense on a core basis down 3% for a 14th consecutive quarter of operating leverage. Returns are strong and we continue to drive it, and we look forward to seeing you next quarter. Thank you. Operator : This will conclude today\u2019s program. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",

Later, you\u2019ll have the opportunity to ask questions during the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this call is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Mr. Lee McIntyre. Please go ahead. Lee McIntyre : Good morning. Thanks for joining this morning\u2019s call to review our 3Q \u201818 results. By now, I hope everybody has had a chance to review the earnings release documents on the Investor Relations section of bankofamerica.com website. Before I turn the call over to our CEO, Brian Moynihan, let me just remind you that we may make forward-looking statements during the call. After Brian\u2019s comments, our CFO, Paul Donofrio will review the details of the third quarter results. We\u2019ll then open up for questions. For further information on our forward-looking comments, please refer to either our earnings release documents, our website, or our SEC filings. With that, take it away, Brian. Brian Moynihan : Thank you, Lee. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us to review our third quarter results. This is another quarter in which Bank of America delivered on the core tenets of our shareholder model. On a year-over-year basis, we grew revenue a little better than GDP. We grew loans in our core business on the same basis and deposits along those same lines. We managed expense as well. In fact, our expenses were down year-over-year by 2%, and we continue to manage risk well. We\u2019ve reached decade lows in credit costs. This allowed us to grow our earnings nicely, our pretax was up 18%, and we returned virtually all those earnings to you, our shareholders. And this cap returned allowed us to reduce our share count by over 5% year-over-year and grow EPS faster than earnings. So, beginning on slide two. During the third quarter, our 200,000 plus teammates did a great job for you, our shareholders. They drove $9 billion of pretax earnings. This is a highest quarter in the Company\u2019s history. And we grew pretax by 18% over the third quarter of 2017. Our operating model continues to deliver. In each of the past 11 quarters, we have grown pretax earnings compared to the year ago period and done so by an average of 15%. We are in operating environment that has a strong growing U.S. economy, low unemployment, growing wage growth and strong consumer spending levels. Client engagement, optimism, and activity remains good. For the quarter, net income was $7.2 billion after tax, an increase of 32% over last year. EPS was $0.66, up 43%. Our return on tangible common equity was 15.5%, improving 450 basis points over last year. Our return on assets reached 1.23% this quarter. Driving that year-over-year improvement was 4% revenue growth. Net interest income led the way here with 6% growth year-over-year. The value of our deposit franchise is showing both in our NII and our net interest yield improvement, and Paul is going to take through the details on that later. Our balance sheet from both a capital and liquidity standpoint remained very strong, allowing us to pay $4 billion in common dividends year-to-date and spend $15 billion to reduce our share count in the same period. $6.5 billion of that $19 billion of year-to-date return came this quarter. On a diluted basis, average shares declined 5% from last year. We now reduced our average diluted shares by $1.4 billion from their peak and outstanding shares fell below a $10 billion market quarter, which is below the level we started at with this management team in 2010. The team\u2019s continued to demonstrate good organic responsible growth this quarter. Year-over-year, we grew loans and average by more than 3% across the business segments. Our commercial loan growth as you\u2019ve seen in the market, moderated a bit this quarter, but keep in mind that many companies came into the year flush with cash. They continue to make good money and they also have cash they are repatriating. And lastly, they continue to benefit from tax savings and they\u2019re using that to keep their debt levels in check. We believe this liquidity position should change as the economy continues to grow and expand as the need for capital expenditure continues to rise. In addition, we grew deposits on average 4%, year-over-year. This marks the 12th straight quarter we have grown average deposits by $40 billion on a year-over-year basis. This growth illustrates our strong competitive position. Of the $40 billion consumer checking contributed $25 billion in those balance growth as they grew over 8% year-over-year. The $350 billion of those checking balances have grown every quarter since 2012; they were up 9% on a compounded growth rate since that time. In addition, Global Banking deposits grew nicely as well and wealth management continued to stabilize. We grew credit cards and checking accounts. We broke the $200 billion asset mark in Merrill Edge online brokerage platform. We have now doubled those assets twice in the past eight years with plenty of room ahead for future growth. Overall, our client balances within our wealth management business, the best business there is in the world, exceeded $2.8 trillion. Annualized net household growth, Merrill Lynch is up nearly 4 times from last year\u2019s advisors with more accounts. In addition, we grew small business clients and balances. Small business originations, key to supporting those communities we serve, this quarter were up over $2 billion -- were $2 billion, up 9% from last year. And we continue to acquire new commercial banking clients. So, we\u2019re optimistic as we continue to add more customers and deepen existing relationships. With respect to credit risk, hereto we maintained our strong credit culture, and yes, we grew responsibly. Net charge-offs and ratios declined from second quarter levels as did nearly every key asset quality metric. Many factors in addition to our disciplined underwriting standards continue to contribute to success here. Our costs, with expense this quarter at $13.07 billion, our trailing four quarters expense equaled $53.5 billion. We achieved this run rate while making investments for shared success, the name we have for our tax reform grants of cash and stock to over 90% of our employees, increased investments in technology, increased investments in infrastructure, increased investments in relationship managers and physical plant. Since we declared in the second quarter 2016 that we would see a 53 billionish run rate in 2018, we have now achieved it. At first, some of you were skeptical of that but we\u2019re here. And I have some good news, we\u2019ll stay here. As we developed our plans for 2019 and 2020, we reaffirmed that expenses will continue to be in line with the trailing four quarter $53.5 billion number. It takes great discipline and strong execution by our teammates. Our team\u2019s ability to invest heavily while driving expense improvements has attributed to this innovation and discipline. This discipline combined with great customer work produces operating leverage. As you go to slide three, in 2015 and 2016, some of you also questioned whether we could drive operating leverage; with expenses attributable to run-off activities, or were they not generating enough revenue. Well, we have done it again. This quarter marks the 15th consecutive quarter of operating leverage, every quarter since the beginning of 2015. And you can see this on slide three with 700 basis points of operating leverage in this quarter. Revenue is up 4% and expenses were down more than 2%. The efficiency ratio fell to 57%, a 400 basis-point improvement from last year. The work the teams are driving is delivering productivity savings that are paying for investments in a franchise at unprecedented levels and offsetting merit and other inflation costs to hold underlying costs steady. As we\u2019ve driven that operating leverage, a question which also gets asked is are we investing enough in our franchise. We are long-term managers with a short-term focus. That is what we call driving sustainable responsible growth. Yes, discipline on expenses can be coeval with investment. On slide four, you can see a sampling of investments made in the franchise, not only in technology which tends to get all the publicity, but also investments made in our people, in our physical footprint and infrastructure. The point here is while we have driven our cost base lower every year for the past eight years, we have been constantly investing in the future of the franchise, and we\u2019ve listed some of these here. On technology alone, since 2012, we\u2019ve invested roughly $20 billion in new initiatives spending alone. That\u2019s a $3 billion a year pace or nearly a third of our current annual technology and operations budget. These consistent investments allowed us to replace almost every major platform the Company operates and now add new and exciting platforms for growth at the same time. In addition, we have reduced data centers, migrating two-thirds of our applications to our internal cloud. We rolled out digital capabilities across our lending consumer online platform. We rolled out to Erica, our digital assistant, our digital mortgage, our digital auto, and on and on. In our wealth management business, we are rolling out a sleeker Merrill Lynch digital platform with more integration between banking and investing, along with adding industry leading capabilities or market data, enhanced document scanning and texting capabilities between advisors and our clients. In Global Banking, we enabled additional cash pro digital capabilities, giving CFOs and treasurers more mobile capabilities and insights to see and move cash at the companies just as our consumers do. Usage and adoption continues at a steady pace, and we\u2019re investing heavily in our capabilities and funding for both domestic international treasury services. In international, we have not only invested expense dollars, we invested in balance sheet, driving outstanding loans from $30 billion in 2010 to nearly $100 billion today. In markets, we upgraded our systems and are allowing faster execution for our customers with enhanced reporting and other capabilities, again to take advantage of our investment not only in expense dollars but also in our prime brokers balance sheet and risk deployment. Across the firm, we continue to use robotics and other automated processes, replace for better than office work, driving operational excellence. And at the same time, we\u2019ve been investing in our financial center network and other infrastructure. Over the last three years, we\u2019ve added 103 brand new financial centers with improved layouts and technology capabilities for customers. This included entering 4 new markets so far and 5 more to come where retail footprint didn\u2019t exist but the rest of the franchise was well established. In that case, we have an installed customer base already and we can serve them more broadly. We also have announced plans to open several hundred more branches across the entire franchise over the next three years, as well as opening new branches we have renovated 700 financial centers over the past couple and have another 1,200 planned in these in a couple of years ahead. So, we\u2019ve finished upgrading nearly every ATM. With regards to our people, we adopted starting wage of $15 an hour in February of 2017. We increased our paid parental leave to 16 weeks for both parents and 40% of those taking that are males. We increased our bereavement period. We invested heavily in learning and development program called the Academy, a tangible investment in careers of over 40,000 teammates to better drive engagements, stability and productivity of our workforce. We have a new Pathways program, with hiring in local neighborhoods, the communities we serve to draw on a diverse employee basis. So, far this year we\u2019ve hired 2,000 people from those communities. And across every line of business, we are hiring client facing professionals. More relationship managers, more Merrill Edge advisors, more Merrill Edge financial advisors, more U.S. trust advisors, more small business bankers, more business bankers, more commercial bankers, more middle market investment bankers and more corporate bankers and so on. We\u2019re using our resource to invest the future of the franchise, the people work and the tool we have to serve our clients, the capabilities our value and the communities we live in. All the while, we continue to reduce expenses. All the while, we continue to produce operating leverage. All the while, we improve the customer experience and brand scores, and our risk remains under control, and that\u2019s what we call driving responsible growth. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Paul. Paul Donofrio : Good morning everyone. I\u2019m starting on slide five. Bank of America reported net income of $7.2 billion or $0.66 per diluted share. Net income was up 32% from Q3 \u201817 and EPS grew 43%. Growth was strong, even if you adjust for the lower tax rate from the Tax Act. Year-over-year, pretax income, as Brian noted, reached a record $9 billion, up 18%. Once again, our year-over-year earnings growth was driven by strong operating leverage and strong asset quality. The 4% improvement in revenue was driven by NII improvement. And with expenses down more than 2%, we drove 700 basis points of operating leverage. Provision expense was $118 million lower than Q3 \u201817. NPLs, reservable criticized exposure and delinquencies all declined while net charge-offs were up $32 million year-over-year, mostly from seasoning of our credit card portfolio and loan growth. The effective tax rate for the quarter was a little more than 20%. The tax rate in Q4 should be marginally higher, absent unusual items. Turning to the balance sheet on slide six. Overall, compared to the end of Q2, deposit growth of $36 billion drove an increase in assets of $47 billion. The deposits were invested in cash, investments as well as reverse repo. Liquidity remained strong with average global liquidity sources of $537 billion and the liquidity coverage ratio of 120%. Total shareholders\u2019 equity decreased $2.1 billion from Q2. We returned 96% of net income available to common through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. Common equity was driven lower by $1.5 billion reduction in AOCI from the impact of higher long end rates on the value of our AFS debt securities. Preferred stock declined as redemptions of some higher yielding issuances caught up with the new preferred we issued in the first half at lower yields. Turning to regularly metrics. Our CET1 standardized ratio was stable with Q2 at 11.4% and remains well above our 9.5% minimum. The small decline in capital driven by OCI that I just mentioned was offset by a small improvement in risk-weighted assets. The supplementary leverage ratio remains well above U.S. regulatory minimum. Looking at deposits on slide seven. Overall average deposits grew 4% year-over-year. We thought it would be helpful to show deposit growth in a little more detail this quarter. A few takeaways that I want to note. First, in total, average deposits have grown $157 billion or a CAGR of 4% over the past three years. That\u2019s an average of $50 billion per year. Secondly, June was down a little over that time period consistent with other wealth managers, for all the reasons that we reviewed in the past quarters around deposit alternatives. Third, Global Banking continues to grow well, up 4% annually since 2015, reflecting the investments we\u2019ve made in our global treasury services capabilities. Also within Global Banking, in addition to the growth, note the rotation from non-interest bearing to interest bearing deposits. But, what I really want to draw your attention too, is Consumer Banking growth in the upper right. Overall, consumer deposits have grown at a CAGR of 7%, but within consumer deposits, focus on the accounts that our customers use to transact every day. These transactional accounts, i.e. consumer non-interest bearing and low-interest checking accounts are the most valuable types of accounts. And these two account categories combined have grown every quarter since 2012; and just since 2015, as shown here, have grown at a compounded annual rate of 9%. We believe this pace of growth and the aggregate level of these account categories is demonstrably better than the market. This leadership reflects the value customers see in not only are deposit capabilities but also their total relationship with us, including preferred relationship rewards, simple transparent products, lower service charges, improved customer service, enhanced mobile capabilities, and improved physical centers. Turning to slide eight. Total loans on an average basis were $931 billion. Total loan growth continued to be impacted by the run-off and sales of non-core consumer real estate loans. In addition to the typical run-off, near the end of this quarter, we sold the portfolio of non-core consumer real estate loans with the book value of $3.7 billion, recording a small gain. Focusing on loans and our business segments, they were up $29 billion or 3% year-over-year. Our consumer loans grew 5% year-over-year, as mortgage originations grew across both Consumer Banking and wealth management, and clients grew card balances 3%. Commercial loans grew 2% year-over-year. While up year-over-year, we did experience a slowdown this quarter in commercial loans. As Brian mentioned, competition for commercial loans remains intense. Accommodating capital markets are receptive alternative to bank loans. Non-bank lenders have likely increased their market share, and companies remain flushed with cash and are generating solid earnings. Having said that, our dollar decline [ph] continues to be robust and the economy continues to grow, which bodes well for continued loan growth. Turning to asset quality on slide nine. Asset quality continued to perform very well. Total net charge-offs were $932 million or 40 basis points of average loans. Net charge-offs were up $32 million from a year ago, as we saw expected seasoning and balance growth in credit cards. Compared to Q2 \u201818, losses were lower by $64 million as Q2 included seasonally higher losses in credit card and some modest 2017 storm-related losses. Provision expense included a $216 million net reserve release, reflecting improvement in our consumer real estate and energy portfolio as well as other more broad-based commercial improvements. Turning to slide 10, we break out credit quality metrics of both our consumer and commercial portfolios. As you can see, the year-over-year change in the net charge-offs was mainly a consumer card story, while commercial was down modestly. And, as Brian mentioned, note the improvement in almost every other asset quality metric. Turning to slide 11. Net interest income on a GAAP non-FTE basis was $11.9 billion, $12 billion on an FTE basis. Compared to Q3 \u201817, GAAP NII was up $710 million or 6%. The benefit of higher interest rates as well as loan deposit growth was modestly offset by higher funding costs in Global Markets. On a linked quarter basis, GAAP NII was up $220 million. Higher interest rates and deposit growth also drove the linked quarter improvement, aided by an additional net interest. Net interest yield improved 6 basis points year-over-year and 4 basis points linked quarter. Note that we have presented net interest yield excluding our Global Markets segment which primarily reflects our trading-related assets, so that you can see more transparency into our banking activities. On this adjusted basis, NII is up $850 million year-over-year and the net interest yield up is up 13 basis points, driven by a broad improvement in asset yields relative to funding costs. With respect to the deposit pricing, we continue to see a slow upward movement in rate paid in total interest bearing deposits. Average rate paid on interest bearing deposits rose 12 basis points from Q2 and is up 44 basis points versus Q4 \u201815, which was the beginning of this Fed rate hike cycle. Turning now to asset sensitivity. As of 9/30, an instantaneous 100 basis-point parallel increase in rates above the forward yield curve is estimated to increase NII by $2.9 billion over the subsequent 12-months. Note that the short-end represents a little more than 75% of this sensitivity. Turning to slide 12. We had another solid quarter of expense management. Non-interest expense of $13.1 billion was down $327 million or 2% year-over-year. For 4 years now, our teams have driven expenses lower every quarter on a year-over-year basis, with only one exception, our efficiency ratio of 57%, improving 400 basis points from Q3 \u201817. The expense discipline was fairly broad-based across personnel, marketing, litigation and other general operating costs. Our headcount fell more than 5,000 from last year, despite adding client-facing associates in several businesses. And I would emphasize that we achieved this reduction even as we increased our investment in technology, in new financial centers, and in our people, as Brian mentioned earlier. In fact, if you recall, Brian mentioned last quarter that we increased our budget for new initiative spending starting this quarter by $75 million per quarter through the end of 2019. Turning to the business segments and starting with Consumer Banking on slide 13. Another outstanding quarter for this segment as client balances grew, revenues increased and expenses were down. This quarter, earnings grew 49% to $3.1 billion, marking the 13th consecutive quarter that earnings in Consumer Banking have increased year-over-year. With 4% year-over-year deposit growth and 8% increase in consumer payments, we believe we are gaining share and deepening relationships. Consumer Banking created nearly 1,000 basis points of operating leverage this quarter as revenue grew 7% while expenses were down 2%. Engagement with customers was strong. Year-over-year, average loans grew 6% and average deposits grew 4%. Primary accounts have now grown to 91% of all deposit accounts. Merrill Edge brokerage assets grew 22%, surpassing $200 billion. The cost of running the business continues its decline as the cost of deposit fell to 152 basis points, while the rate paid remained low at 6 basis points. The efficiency ratio dropped to 46% in the quarter, improving more than 450 basis points in the past 12 months. Provision expenses decreased from Q3 \u201817 due mostly to a smaller reserve build in credit card. The net charge-off ratio remained low at 119 basis points, up only 1 basis point from Q3 \u201817. Turning to slide 14 and key trends. I would make just a few points here. We believe relationship deepening is driving improvement in revenue, predominantly NII. This quarter, year-over-year revenue growth was 7%, included a 10% growth in NII as well as modestly higher revenue and card income and service charges. Customer satisfaction in Consumer Banking reached a new high with more than 80% of our clients rating us 9 or 10 on a 10-point scale. This improvement in customer satisfaction is clearly an important factor, driving the strong growth in customer balance, as I mentioned a moment ago. And we are achieving this growth while lowering expenses. This quarter productivity improvements more than offset the continued investment in technology and financial center renovations and in our sales staff. Brian already viewed our past activity with respect to the significant investments in both new and modernized financial centers. I would just add that this quarter, we opened 9 new centers and renovated another 96. Turning to digital trends on slide 15, a few highlights. As you can see, we continue to grow mobile users, which were up 10% year-over-year. And while total payments were up more than 8% year-over-year, digital payments were up 14%. And by the way, annualizing payment volume equates to $2.8 trillion of payments by Bank of American customers. Within that, Bank of America has now surpassed 4 million users that processed $12 billion of payments in the quarter. Mobile and ATM now account for more than 3 quarters of deposit transactions. And lastly, mobile with all its benefits for both our customers and our shareholders is now approaching half of all digital sales. Turning to Global Wealth and Investment Management on slide 16. GWIM produced another quarter of strong results, earning net income of more than $1 billion which was the second highest quarter ever for the segment. Earnings were up 31% and pretax income was up 10%. The pretext margin improved to 28%. The business created more than 200 basis points of operating leverage, growing revenue 4% while holding expense growth to 1%. Strong client activity and a healthy equity market coupled with solid expense management all benefited results. We are asking Merrill Lynch advisors to improve organic growth and the embedded incentives in our 2018 compensation program to drive responsible organic household growth. Advisors have responded positively and we have seen year-to-date net household on an annualized basis grew 4 times faster than 2017. With respect to U.S. Trust, we\u2019re also seeing good results. Like Merrill, U.S. Trust has grown advisors and households. Moving to slide 17. Trends reflect solid overall client engagement in Merrill Lynch and U.S. Trust. Our local market strategy led by 93 market presidents is helping to better integrate our lines of business and deepen relationships, especially in wealth management. Competitive advisor attrition remained near historic lows. Year-over-year, client balances rose to record levels of more than $2.8 trillion, driven by higher market values, solid AUM flows and continued loan growth. AUM balances, which have climbed to over $1.1 trillion are up $108 billion versus Q3 \u201817 with flows contributing $61 billion of that increase. Average loans of a $162 billion grew 5% year-over-year with continued strength in consumer real estate and custom lending. Year-over-year revenue growth of 4% was led by a 9% increase in asset management fees and modestly higher NII, partially offset by lower transactional revenue. Turning to slide 18. Global Banking earned slightly less than $2 billion and generated a 19% return on allocated capital. Earnings were up 13% from Q3 \u201817. Revenue and pre-tax earnings were both down 5% year-over-year. Growth in NII was partially offset by a decline in investment banking fees and the impact of the Tax Act with respect to tax advantaged investments. Note, this impact on tax advantaged investments affects our segment reporting, but has no effect on the Company\u2019s consolidated results. Expenses were held flat versus Q3 \u201817 despite our continued investments in the business, including the addition of sales professionals to enhance local market coverage. Looking at trends on slide 19 and comparing to Q3 last year. At 2% year-over-year, growth in average loans moderated this quarter while deposits grew 7%. We believe both have been impacted by repatriation of cash. Second quarter data was recently released on repatriation of overseas earnings, through dividends and withdrawals. That data shows that repatriation in the first half of 2018 exceeded the prior two years combined. IB fees of $1.2 billion for the overall firm declined 18% year-over-year. For context, note that the overall industry feel pool declined 16% from last year. The decline in advisory fees this quarter was driven by a decrease in our announced volumes over the past couple of quarters; our pipeline today reflects some pickup in our share of announced transactions since then. Leveraged finance underwriting was another area where we experienced a decline that was a bit more than the industry fee pools as we maintained our focused on the les highly levered deals amid a slowdown in client activity. The bright spot of the quarter was a significant increase in equity underwriting fees. Switching to Global Markets on slide 20, I will talk about the results excluding the DVA. Global Markets grew earnings by 28% year-over-year to just under $1 billion, producing a solid return on allocated capital of 11%. Revenue was stable compared to Q3 \u201817, while expenses declined 4%. Within revenue a decline in sales and trading was offset by a gain on the sale of an equity investment and a trading platform. Sales and trading declined 3% year-over-year to $3.1 billion. FICC declined 5%, while equities grew 3%. The lower FICC sales and trading performance was driven by lower client activity and rates and a weaker environment in municipal bonds. On the other hand, equities benefited from increased client financing activity, reflecting investments made in the business over the past 18 months. Equity derivative also performed better and was offset by weaker performance in cash. On slide 21, I would just point out the chart on the bottom left, which shows the relative stability of sales and trading revenue across the past three years on a year-to-date basis. It also shows the stability and benefit that comes with diversity as growth in equity revenue has made up for the decline in FICC revenue. On slide 22, we show all other, which reported net income of $144 million. This is an improvement from Q3 \u201817 of $90 million. Revenue improvements include the small gain mentioned earlier on the sale of a non-core portfolio and a lower reps and warranty expense. Otherwise, the net impact of lower expense and less provision benefit were offset by less income tax benefit from applying a lower tax rate to a smaller pretax loss in the current period. Okay. With that, let\u2019s open it up for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take our first question from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Steven Chubak : Hi. Good morning. So, I was hoping to maybe start off, Brian, with just a question on the investment banking strategy. There has been a lot of focus in the press on some of the senior personnel changes at the investment bank whether your lack of risk appetite maybe negatively impacted revenue growth? And I was just hoping you can maybe set the record straight. Give us your own perspective on BAC\u2019s performance relative to the peer set across those businesses and maybe how you\u2019re planning on striking out right balance between responsible growth, while maintaining that commitment to risk adjusted returns. Brian Moynihan : I think, Paul actually can speak to this too, because he was a leader in that business. But, the team did a good job across the last several years of repositioning us after the crisis. Tom Montag has brought in a new leader to help carry us through the next level as we look forward. We know we can get our fair share out of that business. We got to keep it balanced, both domestically and internationally across the platform and make sure we are doing a great job in the Unites States because A, the size of the business; and b, our competitive business with our middle market business. And on the other hand, we\u2019ve invested heavily to support the Global Banking business including investment banking and that business earned $2 billion after tax, and we\u2019ve increased the commitments in that business internationally, as I said earlier from $30 billion round numbers after the crisis to almost to $100 billion today. So, we can do better and we\u2019ll just keep pushing away at it. It\u2019s a $1 billion and change of revenue. A lot of it was driven by the M&A environment where we didn\u2019t get our fair share. But, the key is to maintain our dominance in debt underwriting and things like that which we\u2019ve got to make sure we do. Paul? Paul Donofrio : Look, I\u2019m not sure what else to add. I would just say look, if you look at where we can kind of underperformed this quarter, it was in M&A and a little bit in leveraged finance. And M&A, our market share declined a bit this quarter. You kind of saw that in the announced transactions, if you go back a quarter or two. Our clients -- some of our clients -- we were in some of those deals that our clients just didn\u2019t win or our client was not involved or perhaps we didn\u2019t get chosen in some of those deals. But if you look at announced transactions since then, I think you can see that we rebounded a bit. In leveraged finance, you all have written about this quite a bit. Regulatory guidance is out there impacting underwriting leveraged finance in U.S. banks; you\u2019ve got non-bank entries; at the same time, we\u2019ve got terms and structures that are getting a little bit more risky. So, we are staying focused on responsible growth. We\u2019re not chasing the market. We want to make sure we are able to service our customers and clients through this cycle. So, that\u2019s how I think about the areas where this quarter we underperformed a little bit. To Brian\u2019s point, having said all that, I think we know we can do better. I did come from investment banking. I know they have built a great business with great bankers. And we have one of the best platforms on the plant. Very few banks that can do for clients what we can do for them in every major market around the world. So from my perspective, this is just about renewing our focus, reenergizing the teams. There is really no reason we can\u2019t execute on this opportunity. Steven Chubak : That\u2019s extremely helpful color. So, I appreciate remarks from both of you. Just one follow-up for me and I\u2019ll head back in the queue, on loan growth. You\u2019ve talked in the past about mid single digit loan growth being a sustainable target for the core businesses. It\u2019s been a very steady trend that we\u2019ve seen over the last few quarters. The commercial side did slow down a bit. I know you had alluded to that. I\u2019m just wondering whether you\u2019re still committed to delivering that mid single digit loan growth and whether that\u2019s a sustainable target from here in your view. Brian Moynihan : Yes. I think we\u2019re still committed to doing that. You can see, as you referenced, Steven, in slide eight, you can see that commercial slowed down a little bit in the last section. But, the key, the consumer and the GWIM business continues to grow well. We expect to be in the mid single digits. The big debate is if the economy slowed down a little bit from the current growth rate next year, as many people projected, if it goes into recession, that changes the picture obviously. But, if it just slows down, remember, the economy that grew 2% plus or minus for many years, after the recovery settled in, you can see on slide eight, you can see that in earlier things, we grew loans in mid single digits. So, we\u2019re comfortable in a 2% growth economy and we can continue to do that. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Betsy Graseck : I had two questions. One, just on deposits. I know that you spent quite a bit of time going through on page seven the growth rates there. Could you give us a little bit of color around how you are driving that increase in deposit growth, given that your deposit yields are not the highest on the street? You\u2019ve got a very efficient deposit franchise. So, I just wanted to dig into that, as well as on the Global Banking side, increase in deposits, would you deem those to be operating or non-operating? Just wondering. Paul Donofrio : So, on the Global Banking side, these are operating deposits that we\u2019re growing. We are very focused on growing operating deposits, and we have very few, 100% we\u2019re off LCR -- deposit products. There has been a shift between non-interest-bearing to interest-bearing, but they are still operating deposits. In terms of how are we growing deposits across the franchise with as little deposit rate paid growth that we\u2019re seeing. First of all, we are growing -- we are increasing deposit rate paid in GWIM and Global Banking. We and the industry have not increased deposit rates appreciably in traditional consumer bank accounts. I think the reason for that is because Bank of America delivers a lot of value to depositors. We\u2019ve got transparency, convenience, safety, mobile banking, online banking, a nationwide network of financial centers, we\u2019ve got rewards, advice and counsel. This value plus the lack of market pressure so far has allowed us to keep deposit rates relatively flat on traditional retail accounts. Like I said, we\u2019ve been rising rates in GWIM and IB. We\u2019ll just have to wait and see. At some point, rates are going to rise in consumer as well, and our focus is on balancing our customers\u2019 needs with the competitive marketplace and our shareholders\u2019 interest, and we\u2019ll do the right thing. Betsy Graseck : And your branch expansions that you\u2019re planning on doing over the next several years, that hasn\u2019t materially kicked in yet. Is that correct? Brian Moynihan : It\u2019s been material relative to the start to finish and we\u2019ve crossed a $100 million branch for example in Denver within three years, which is very strong, but it\u2019s not material to the $1.4 trillion deposit base or the $680 billion in consumer. So, it\u2019s not contributing; it will over time, but right now, it\u2019s marginally adding. Betsy, a couple things to think about. The amount of investment we\u2019ve made in the global transaction services platform across the last eight or nine years have been over $2 billion. So, those deposits come from the ability to continue to provide better and better services to clients in an investment rate, and that\u2019s the thing. This takes a lot of investment, not only on the consumer side, which is obvious with the mobile and everything that you statistically see, but a lot of people forget on the commercial side, the institutional side, there is this likewise investment going on. So that we think is competitively advantaged and our customers respond to it. Paul Donofrio : And those deposits are up 7% year-over-year. So, we\u2019re seeing the growth. Betsy Graseck : Okay. So, then, just my last question here is on the LCR ticked down very slightly from 122 to 120. And if the Global Banking is not driving that, what was driving the slight tick down that you had in LCR ratios this quarter? Paul Donofrio : I don\u2019t think anything other than maybe just our outflow assumptions, the tweaking of models here or there. We have a significant cushion of LCR at the top of the house. Really, if there is any -- where we manage liquidity is more at the bank level, where we have to be more careful, at the top of the house, we have plenty of liquidity. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from John McDonald from Bernstein. Please go ahead. John McDonald : Hi. Good morning. Brian, you guys delivered on the expense numbers again this quarter, and the commitment to keep the expenses flat at $53.5 billion for two more years is impressive. I know I\u2019ve asked you this before; I\u2019d love to hear it again. You\u2019ve come so far on improving efficiency already and you are doing a lot of investing, as you detailed on slide four. So, how you do all that, the modernization to build out the expansion, and then also keep expenses flat for two years? Brian Moynihan : Well, John, if you look at -- one of the interesting things, just to use the consumer example, if you look at their cost of producing the deposits, in other words, if we take all the costs in the consumer business, put it over the deposit base, you can see that\u2019s dropped 152 basis points, so marginally improving from second quarter to third quarter by 3 basis points last year, 7 basis points this year. That is just all the stuff we are talking about. If you look, there\u2019s a few less branches. The transactions per branch are going up. The sales in branches continue to go up, as well as digital sales. And you can look at all the statistics on page 15 of the digitalization. That we\u2019re taking through the whole franchise. So, specifically, headcount reductions are due to continued applying of technology, branch reductions, bigger branches, more sales and relationship management people, but less number in footprint and more efficient -- more activity by the customer taking to the digital platforms, digital sales at 23%, and it\u2019s just bringing square footage down in the company from 130 million to about 75 million, continued densification beyond that due to not only reduced FTE, but also the ability to densify the space through some of the work we\u2019re doing in new space, for example, in New York. We created an internal cloud. There was an external cloud at the time. People didn\u2019t even talk about the concept. We brought about 80% of our applications onto that cloud. That makes us much more efficiency in our server costs and environment; standardization of platforms. It is every little thing. Frankly, 9,000 less managers over the last three years. To give you a sense, since 2015, we started looking at layers and expanse of control in the Company. And so, it isn\u2019t ever going to be any one thing. Each year, we invest probably $0.5 billion in initiatives to help drive efficiencies. But, the efficiencies not only show up in pure dollars, they also show up in operational losses, and litigation, and other things, which is just -- we strive to be perfect. And if we can\u2019t be that, we\u2019ll be excellent, and that will produce a lot of saved money. If you look back over the last decade or two, we\u2019ve had errors and operational losses, which led to some well-known issues, but -- and all those are costly. Our job is to keep it out of here. John McDonald : Okay. And just a quick follow-up to that. I know you don\u2019t have a formal goal on this metric, but you printed an efficiency ratio of 57% this quarter. If you continue to deliver that positive operating leverage into next year and 2020, which seems likely, is there any reason you shouldn\u2019t aspire to get to that mid-50s over time on that metric? Brian Moynihan : We should keep pushing it down to that level. Yes. John McDonald : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Mike Mayo : Hi. Just to follow up to that last question. So, I know John, who asked the question, said, if you get better revenue growth, are you committing or do you expect to have higher revenues in 2019 and 2020? Brian Moynihan : Given the economy, if we have what are consistent with the economic projections of us and the rest of the people, sure. Mike Mayo : Okay. So, flat expenses with higher revenues for the next two years. I guess, one reason that you just mentioned for that is digital banking. You have 26 million mobile banking users. What\u2019s the total size of the market? What percent of the market do you have in mobile banking? Brian Moynihan : That\u2019s going to be -- I don\u2019t know if I have that off the top of my head, Mike. But, if there is 130, 140 million households plus all the users, I think we have more than our fair share of it. So, we can get to that calculation. I\u2019ll ask Lee to get back to you. I don\u2019t have it off the top of my head. Mike Mayo : That\u2019d be great. And as far as the new markets, can you remind us what are your four new markets and the five new markets yet to come? Brian Moynihan : The four new markets are Denver, Minneapolis, Indianapolis, and Pittsburgh are actually open. And then we have Cincinnati, Columbus, Lexington, Cleveland -- I\u2019m missing one. Paul Donofrio : Out west? Brian Moynihan : I got Lexington. But anyway, we\u2019ve got them listed somewhere here. I\u2019ll send them to you. Mike Mayo : Okay. And then\u2026 Brian Moynihan : Salt Lake City is the other one. Mike Mayo : Salt Lake City? Okay. So, why now? It seems like everybody\u2019s engaging in the national digital banking wars at the same time. And so, you\u2019re not alone in some of this expansion. I guess, your advantage -- your consumer efficiency ratio this quarter, if I\u2019m looking at this right, was 46%. So, maybe that is your advantage. So, why are you expanding in all these markets de novo now? And are you doing enough to press your advantage, if you are indeed more efficient than others? Brian Moynihan : Mike, you have to go back to -- and you can because you\u2019ve been around a long time, but you have to go back to the history of interstate banking. And the reason why we\u2019re not in these markets is a completely historical accident where a franchise wasn\u2019t when we made acquisitions. And so, the idea is that in these markets we have customer bases already there, and we\u2019re putting the branch system in conjunction with the customer bases and the teammates we already have there. So, if you took Denver, we had commercial banking, we had business banking, we had Merrill Lynch, we had U.S. Trust. And we put the branches underneath, and you have a $100 million branch in three years. I think you can look at the competitors\u2019 branch structures that they\u2019ve deployed and they won\u2019t get there for 10 years. So, it\u2019s really a competitive advantage of our brand, our capabilities, and our customer base that we can then get fuller relationships from that already exist. And so, that\u2019s why we\u2019re doing it. It\u2019s not a de novo expansion, i.e., we\u2019d never been heard about. Bank of America\u2019s brand name is recognized and there\u2019s customer base in these markets, and we\u2019re trying to build that high-touch, high-tech service model across all the businesses, including the ability for middle-market and business banking clients to have branches nearby and small business clients to interact with for their business banking needs. And so, it takes both physical plant and digital. A digital-only institution, in our mind, is not the way that you should go. Paul Donofrio : Just one other statistic for you, Mike, that may be helpful. Again, these are our customers who want us to be in these regions because they\u2019re already there. We just don\u2019t have a retail footprint. We have top three deposit market share in 24 out of the top 30 markets in the United States. So, this is about filling out those last six markets to get us in the top three. Mike Mayo : And, last follow-up. Any potential changes in your marketing spend as you engage in this expansion? Brian Moynihan : We increased our marketing spend and our shareholder spend as part of sharing in the shareable side with the communities that benefit the tax reform. So, we increased it $50 million. And on the marketing side, marketing is done differently in this traditional media spend. So, we basically want our customers to be able to answer the question, assess the question themselves, what do you want the power to do. And we\u2019ll keep reminding them that we\u2019re here to provide the services and capabilities they need so they can live their financial lives, and we\u2019ll market that to them. But, with digital marketing, with direct marketing to our own customer base through our -- if you look at that 1.4 billion of mobile channel usage, inherently, there\u2019s marketing built within that and offers and products and capabilities and knowledge. So, the idea is that -- yes, the marketing spend, we did put some more money in marketing to help push some of the expansion that you\u2019re talking about, but it\u2019s relatively marginal. But, at the same time, we\u2019re spending more on marketing that way. We\u2019re also making marketing more efficient. And they self fund a lot of this initiative because they can become more efficient using the modern techniques. Operator : Our next question comes from Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead. Jim Mitchell : Maybe just a quick question on just sort of consumer spend on debit and credit cards, 7% growth felt good, but a little bit of a deceleration from the first half. And I think at your peers, we saw some acceleration in 3Q. Is there anything to read into that in terms of the consumer activity on your cards? Brian Moynihan : The question a little bit that you\u2019re hearing debate, as you see some of the consumer spending numbers come up is they\u2019re very strong. So, the third quarter this year, all spending including cash, all the ATMs, bill pay, everything, it was 8% plus over last year, and last year to the year before that, that number was around 5%. So, it\u2019s still accelerating. We can\u2019t tell whether it\u2019s connected to the days of summer, the dog days and the slowdown, or the hurricanes that affected it, or whether it\u2019s those types of things. But, the reality is, it was running around 9 and 8. There\u2019s one less -- September ended on the Thursday, Friday, or weekends and things. So, all this affects it. But basically, it\u2019s running very strong. Year to date, it\u2019s around 9, third quarter 8. And so, we\u2019re seeing strong consumer spending, no doubt. Jim Mitchell : That hurricane is a good point. Maybe a quick question on asset liability management. Just thinking through on the securities portfolio, yields are kind of slowly grinding higher but obviously, it\u2019s a little bit of a longer duration portfolio. It\u2019s sort of taking its hit on OCI. I think right now, it yields right around where the one-year treasury is. Is there any -- how do we think about that duration and the ability to kind of maybe more quickly reinvest at higher rates, or how do we think about that? Paul Donofrio : Look, we\u2019re always thinking about earnings capital and liquidity when we think about that portfolio. It\u2019s not a -- when you look carefully at it, between the cash we have, between the treasuries, between the mortgage-backed securities, it\u2019s not as -- it doesn\u2019t have a duration as long as one might think. By the way, you can see that in our asset sensitivity. We generally don\u2019t try to manage the NII of the company through adjusting that portfolio. That\u2019s there -- it\u2019s there to take our excess deposits and put them to work if we don\u2019t have the loan growth to absorb all those deposits. As rates rise, we\u2019re going to have an opportunity to invest at higher yields. That takes a little bit of time. The biggest impact as rates rise is you tend to see less premium amortization. But, over time, as rates rise, it\u2019s going to have a meaningful impact. It just takes a little while. Jim Mitchell : You\u2019re shortening that over time, though -- maturities? Paul Donofrio : No, I don\u2019t see us shortening it. Again, we are always sort of thinking about liquidity, capital -- the effect on capital, liquidity and the effect on earnings. You kind of want to go along to get the most earnings, but it\u2019s a pretty flat yield curve. So, you\u2019ve got to really think about that. You want to go shorter -- if you\u2019re trying to protect your capital, we\u2019re just always managing capital, liquidity, and earnings when we think about that portfolio. But having said all that, generally, we don\u2019t make a lot of changes. We have a plan to invest and we follow that plan religiously quarter-after-quarter. And again, we\u2019re talking about the excess deposits, where do those go if we don\u2019t have enough loan growth to absorb the excess deposits. As you know, we\u2019re growing deposits consistently faster than we\u2019ve been growing loans. So, it goes into that portfolio. Jim Mitchell : Okay, great. Thanks. Paul Donofrio : One more thing by the way. I just want to emphasize for everybody who doesn\u2019t know. We don\u2019t take risk in that portfolio. Some other peers will buy different things in that portfolio. That portfolio for us is made up of cash, treasuries, and agency-backed securities. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will be from Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Matt O\u2019Connor: I was wondering if you could talk about the outlook for net interest income dollars, just given a little bit of a backup in long rates. You just commented that it takes a lot of work at sell-through, but obviously that\u2019s an incremental positive. The continued steady march up in short-term rates should continue to be a positive. It sounds like you are optimistic about loans continue to grow. So, maybe just give us a little outlook on the net interest income dollars the next few quarters or however you want to frame it. Paul Donofrio : Sure. Look, we are optimistic. In 4Q, we\u2019re going to benefit from the September rate hike. We should also benefit from loan and deposit growth. I think, the only real question is how much of these benefits are going to be offset by rate increases on deposits. As you know, we have been increasing our rate paid in GWIM and Global Banking. Having said that, so far, as I think about NII growth in Q4, and it\u2019s obviously early, it sounds a lot like Q3 to me. The other thing I would say is, as you think about it, I would really ask you to think about the year-over-year growth instead of the quarter-over-quarter growth. I mean, as an example, year-over-year \u2013 year-to-date, I think we\u2019re up over $1.9 billion. As you stretch out into the future, move into \u201819, we\u2019re obviously going to factor in the day count as you think about each quarter. I would expect NII growth assuming again continued loan and deposit growth as well as a current forward curve. Deposit pricing is the wild card. We can\u2019t predict with certainty what our competitors are going to do. So, it\u2019s difficult to provide much more perspective than that, but we do feel quite confident. Matt O\u2019Connor: And then, just to clarify, I think you said net interest income growth in 4Q is similar to 3Q. Did you mean the growth rate linked quarter would be similar or the absolute dollar is similar? Paul Donofrio : I would think about it -- I mean, as we\u2019ve started Q4 and it\u2019s early, the NII growth we\u2019re feeling feels a lot like Q3 in terms of the movement in rate paid so far. And so, I would think about it as a year-over-year growth being something that feels the same this early in the quarter. Again, year-to-date, NII is up over $1.9 billion. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay. And then, just a little bit related, as we think about the NIM percentage, obviously a nice increase this quarter. I think, you\u2019re past some of the drags as we think year-over-year in terms of the international card business; it was dragging in the first half of the year. Should that trend up as well? I know there\u2019s also been some drag for markets for you and for others. Is your best guess the NIM percent would trend up as well? Paul Donofrio : Yes. I think, you hit all the points. In 4Q, given the September rate hike, again, I would expect net interest yield or net interest margin, whatever you want to call it, to edge up in fourth quarter. But, again, that increase is going to be dependent on several factors, including loan growth, mix shift, particularly in Global Markets, you\u2019ve got the realization of the forward curve, you\u2019ve got the competitive bottom with respect to deposit rate paid. And I would just, again, think about it banking versus the market\u2019s book. I mean, we\u2019re seeing the benefits of our strong deposit base, how we\u2019ve invested in our clients in a rising rate environment, we\u2019re seeing that if you look at the \u201cbanking book\u201d. Obviously, Global Markets is going to impact that number. But if you look at the banking book, I think you get a better reflection of what\u2019s going on at the company. Operator : Our next question is from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Please go ahead. Glenn Schorr : I just want to follow up on some of the comments you made on loan growth. And I hear you on high competition, good capital markets, non-bank lenders, corporates flush with cash. What I didn\u2019t hear is anything about, from the competition, on aggressive pricing or loosening of terms. So, I wondered if you could address, if you\u2019re seeing that, and particularly from the non-bank lending side because there has been a lot more talk about that lately. Thanks. Brian Moynihan : Consistent with what you\u2019ve heard from other discussions over the last few days, the competition from the non-bank is high and the structures -- you\u2019ve seen written about widely, and I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve written about them too, that have gotten away, and we try to play down the middle and we will continue to do that. Having been in the commercial lending business for 230 years, I think we probably know what we\u2019re doing, and we\u2019re trying to make sure that we\u2019re prepared at any moment for what could come next. Glenn Schorr : Does that mean -- I get your responsible growth mantra and I think your shareholders will love that over time. But, do you see cracks in the armor in terms of -- is that just a return on investment that you\u2019re not willing to go down the path or do you think there\u2019s some irresponsible growth going on? Paul Donofrio : Look, I think what we would emphasize is given the strength of our platform, given the bankers that we\u2019re adding, given our relationships globally, we should be able to grow loans the way we\u2019ve been talking about, even with these forces, even with the non-banks, even with whatever you\u2019re seeing out there. We should be able to grow loans we think at mid-single digits at the whole company level even with all those forces. Let me give you an example. If you look at CRE, so, this is when responsible growth kind of helps you. If you look at CRE, I think we\u2019ve talked about in past quarters we transformed our approach to commercial real estate lending. We\u2019re still very selective, focusing on top-tier companies, and we ensure we maintain a diversified portfolio across property type and geography. And if you look at our CRE portfolio as a percentage of our commercial portfolio, it\u2019s probably the lowest of the top 40 banks. Having said all that, we\u2019re starting to see other banks pull back in CRE. And we\u2019re seeing more opportunities now with clients -- within our client selection and risk framework, we\u2019re seeing more opportunities. So, in Q3 alone, year-over-year, CRE growth was up 3%. I think you\u2019re going to see things like that. CRE is going to turn out to be a great example of responsible growth and how maintaining a strong balance sheet and disciplined underwriting standards through the cycle means you\u2019re going to be able to deliver for your customers and clients when others can\u2019t. Brian Moynihan : There\u2019s a lot of discussion there, but at the end of the day, we think we can grow loans in the mid-single digits at 2, 3% GDP growth. And you\u2019ve seen us to that, and we\u2019ll continue to do that. And the ebbs and flows of the competition will come or go, and we\u2019ll be here driving. Glenn Schorr : Loud and clear. I appreciate that. A little quickie on DCM. You mentioned part of it related to slower advisory quarter, rates, competition, Tax Cuts are there too. Should we consider this a more normalish level of DCM as you and the industry are off recent highs? Paul Donofrio : I think, look, there definitely was a slowdown in client activity in the third quarter in DCM. I would not -- I don\u2019t know, but I do not think that\u2019s systemic. People have to refinance their bonds, and in the growing economy they\u2019re going to borrow more money. So, I would answer that question no. But, we\u2019ll have to wait and see. Operator : Our next question is from Saul Martinez with UBS. Please go ahead. Saul Martinez : Hi. Good morning. Can you quantify the impact of the lower provisions for representations and warranties in the sale of the consumer real estate portfolio in all others? Should we just look at the sequential and year-on-year changes in revenues in all other which is something the neighborhood of 300 to $400 million and estimate that that\u2019s more or less the size of the impact? Paul Donofrio : No, I wouldn\u2019t chalk it up to all the reps and warranties. Reps and warranties were down a little this quarter. But, if you look at net income, it bounces around quite a bit every quarter. I would point out by the way, if you look at that, it\u2019s been gradually declining. I think if you look year-to-date, year-over-year, it\u2019s probably down 800 or $900 million. Remember, it includes MBI, which is less relevant and declining now for us since we\u2019re booking 90% of our mortgages on the balance sheet. This quarter, other income rebounded a bit. It had the equity investment gain that we mentioned earlier of a couple hundred million dollars and some other cats and dogs. Saul Martinez : So, I\u2019m just trying to get out -- I know it bounces around a little. I\u2019m just trying to get out what -- I wouldn\u2019t call it a more normalized figure, just trying to clear out some of the noise to gauge where we should be thinking that line could go, but okay. And I guess, to change gears a little bit, where are you in your CECL preparations and when could we expect to see a more formal estimate of what the financial impact could be? Paul Donofrio : CECL. So, we\u2019re not at the point where we\u2019re going to provide an estimate on the impacts. We\u2019ve made a lot of progress on our efforts towards adoption. However, a number of things need to be finalized really before we can disclose the impacts. I would point out by the way that we\u2019re not overly concerned about those impacts and it\u2019s certainly not going to change how we serve our clients in the future. Having said that, there will likely be some increase to allowance upon adoption, but the amount of increase, the impact is going to be dependent on the economic outlook and credit conditions on the date of adoption, and that\u2019s not until 1/1/2020. So, we\u2019ll just have to wait. Operator : Your next question is from Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Marty Mosby : I want to talk first about asset yields. And earning asset yields were up 11 basis points. There looks to be some noise in other earning assets this particular quarter. It was up 55 basis points. So, just curious what was driving that big increase this particular quarter. Paul Donofrio : Say that again, Marty. Marty Mosby : Other earning assets sequentially was up 55 basis points. So, I was just curious why that was up so much this particular quarter. Paul Donofrio : Other earnings assets was up 55 basis points. Do you think it was the margin? Brian Moynihan : Yes. Paul Donofrio : So, in other earning assets, we have some mix shift as some of our margin loans pay down. Marty Mosby : Okay. And then, in consumer loans, you\u2019ve been going up about 6 basis points per quarter over the last three quarters leading up to this quarter; now, it was up 16 basis points. So, it looked like there was another step up in consumer loans, which I thought may have been maybe something in the consumer loan portfolio as well. Paul Donofrio : I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything unusual in the consumer loan portfolio that\u2019s driving those. It\u2019s just a mix every quarter of what we are growing versus -- fixed versus floating or what happens to the rates. Marty Mosby : Which is good in sense that earning asset yields are moving up faster, which is what we\u2019d expect to happen at this particular part of the interest rate cycle, as you\u2019re beginning to reprice some of the longer term assets as well as the short-term assets. If we actually equate that to what\u2019s happening on the interest-bearing deposit rates, you\u2019re only up a little bit less than 50% deposit beta this particular quarter. But, if you take into account your funding which -- borrowing is a little bit more of a fixed rate, as well as non-interest bearing funds, you really have headroom with how far earning assets are going up at 10 or 11 basis points per quarter or per rate hike to increase interest bearing deposit rates somewhere between 85% and 95% before you really see any pressure on net interest margin. So, it seems like there\u2019s some headroom to still see margins expand, even though we\u2019re seeing deposit rates move up. And I just want to see what you thought about that threshold calculation. Brian Moynihan : Yes. You have to step back and say what the constitutions of deposits are, and I think Paul took you through some of this earlier. But, each business has interest bearing deposits and non-interest bearing deposits, but those are very different types of business. So, some people, the money is effectively investment cash, some people, it\u2019s transactional cash, some people, it\u2019s both, depending on the business. But, at the end of the day, we will continue to -- in the second part is you\u2019ve got to remember that loans are basically priced to go through the market in competitiveness. Your deposits have a lot of other services attached to them. So, it\u2019s much more complex. Rate is not the only determinant of what goes on with a deposit account, as you\u2019re well aware. So, I think there is headroom for us to continue to expand that net interest income margin percent over time as we see a higher rate structure lock in the balance sheet for a host of reasons, most important of which is the checking accounts in consumer, which we talked about, will always have a very advantaged place. And that advantaged place had been lost as they hit the zero floors after the crisis, and it\u2019s finally coming back, and that\u2019s going to drive a substantial amount of deposit value, not only the consumer business but in the franchise. Marty Mosby : I thought that highlight of transaction accounts growing was very important. And the whole reason I was asking is there\u2019s so much consternation about margins starting to go down as interest rates are moving up and deposit rates are finally starting to increase. What investors I think are missing is there\u2019s a lot of headroom to still kind of trickle up those deposit rates and still continue to improve net interest margin. Brian Moynihan : Agreed. Marty Mosby : Thanks. Operator : And we\u2019ll take today\u2019s last question from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Brian Moynihan : Good morning, Gerard. Gerard Cassidy : Hi, Brian. How are you? Brian Moynihan : Good. Gerard Cassidy : You have worked very diligently with your team since 2010, bringing Bank of America to this level of profitability that you reported today, 123 basis points on assets and an ROE of 11%. What do you think -- I know you\u2019re not at your optimum mix in terms of your balance sheet. What do you think -- how much higher can you go, whether it\u2019s ROA or ROE? Is this a bank that can do 140 basis points on assets or is that just way too optimistic? Brian Moynihan : I would say, Gerard, you\u2019ve got to be careful because the mix of the business we have versus what people could have been familiar with at different times in our past is with the markets business and the way that business works in terms of ROA and things, but the reality is the team has done a great job of getting this Company back to an earnings level. And we expect to continue to grow that, and we continue to expect to reduce the share count, 1.4 billion reduction since we started. But, as we say to ourselves when we sit down and look at it, it\u2019s a nice start. And so, we\u2019re going to be here every day, pushing to increase all those things. And if it gets to the level you referenced, we\u2019ll be happy, but the idea is how do we get a better tomorrow than it was today? Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And then, following up on a comment you made a moment ago, obviously, national interstate banking changed the lay of the land for the banks. Your deposit market share is over the 10% level that prohibits a bank from making depository acquisitions. Clearly, you\u2019re going with the organic growth strategy, as you pointed out. As we look out into the future, assuming you\u2019re not allowed to do a depository acquisition, should we look at your return of excess capital consistently to be between 70% and 80% indefinitely out into the future -- 70, 80% of earnings, that is? Brian Moynihan : Right now, between the dividends and share repurchases, $6.5 billion this quarter on earnings of $7.2 billion, so it\u2019s pushing to 100%. We have excess capital under any standard on top of that. So, we\u2019ve got to adjust that as we continue to figure out what the future of the CCAR rules are and stuff like that. But yes, you should expect that we can return it all. And if we ever need to retain it, any portion of it is going to be in conjunction with earnings, which are accretive to the returns in the balance sheet, but just between repositioning loans that you can still see, despite all the efforts -- despite 12 years from the last time some of these loans were produced, we still have $60 billion of non-core loans, which continue to run off that we can replace with $60 billion of good credit, which should be another, I don\u2019t know, 6%, 7% growth over the current core business loans. So, there\u2019s a lot of room in the balance sheet to grow within itself. So, the idea is to continue -- one of the core business model attributes, as I said at the outset, is to continue to return all the earnings to the shareholders in dividends and share buybacks, not because we can\u2019t support -- not because any other reason that we don\u2019t need it to support our customers. You can have good returns and support your customers and be contemporaneous with the ability to produce good shareholder returns and good return of capital. Operator : And this will conclude today\u2019s Q&A portion. I will return the floor to Brian Moynihan for closing remarks. Brian Moynihan : Thank you, everyone, for your time and attention this morning. We continue to operate in a good business environment led by the consumer spending we discussed. Commercial clients continue to have good activity. We continue to perform well in this environment. And we\u2019re getting more than our fair share of business. And to do that, we\u2019ve managed expenses well, drove operating leverage 700 basis points for the quarter. When you think about all this, you have to think back to what we\u2019ve been talking to you each quarter, which is we are here to drive responsible growth, and this quarter shows another quarter of that with record earnings across the franchise. Thank you. Operator : And this will conclude today\u2019s program. Thanks for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",

It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Mr. Lee McEntire. Please go ahead, sir. Lee McEntire : Good morning. Thanks for joining this morning's call to review our fourth quarter and full year 2018 results. By now, everybody\u2019s, I am sure had a chance to review the earnings release documents on our Investor Relations section of bankofamerica.com, our website. Before I turn the call over to our CEO, Brian Moynihan, let me remind you that we may make forward looking statements during the call. After Brian's comments, our CFO, Paul Donofrio, will review the details of the fourth quarter results. Then we'll open it up for questions. For further information on our forward looking statements, please refer to either our earnings release documents, our website, or our SEC filings. With that, take it away, Brian. Brian Moynihan : Hi. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to review our fourth quarter results and 2018 results. Before Paul walks you through some of the details of the latest quarter, I want to review what our 200,000 teammates produced for you in 2018. This year, and in fact, this quarter, we are continuing examples of how our shareholder model works for you. So let's start on Slide 2. We grew the top line a little better than the economy. We managed costs and risks well. We invested heavily in our leading capabilities and in our teammates, and that benefited all of you as we returned almost all of our earnings to you. Looking at full year results, reported record earnings for our company of $28 billion after tax or $2.61 per share. Revenue grew a little better than GDP at 3%, and when discussing the growth rate over 2017, we\u2019re increasing 2017 baseline as shown to add back the charges taken to the Tax Act last year. Our client base has expanded; and in our key business, our market leadership positions continue to improve. Deposits and loans within our business segments grew a little better than the economy. We managed expenses well and hit our target for 2018, which we established a few years ago. In fact, our expenses were down 2% for the year, and that helped achieve 6% operating leverage. We also believe we managed risk well as net charge-offs remained at decade lows. Driving these elements allowed us to grow pre-tax earnings at 15%, and we used our capital to reduce shares and that allowed us to grow EPS faster than our earnings growth rate. And importantly, we believe the same focus on responsible growth with a laser focus on controlling what we can will allow us to continue improved results for 2019. As you can see on Slide 3, every line of business contributed to our growth and are well above our company's cost of capital, and each line of business had superior efficiency through a focus on operating leverage. I put three years on this page, so you can see the improvement across the business for multiple years. This is not a recent phenomenon and will continue in 2019. We expect to continue to drive incremental improvement in these businesses as we take advantage of our very strong franchise and the continued investments in digitalization and operating efficiency, as well as our relationship management capacity and core products and services. Let me give you a few examples. In our consumer banking, after a decade of simplifying our products, reviewing our focus on primary accounts, transforming our delivery network, and driving deeper relationship with our customers, we have seen net new checking accounts growing and those are growing with the same strong core attributes of our existing book. Savings accounts and credit cards have seen the same progress. In Merrill Edge investment assets, we had a 21% year-over-year increase in funded brokerage assets and 25 billion of net client flows. In Merrill Lynch, we grew net relationship four times faster in 2018 than 2017. We saw a record number of our experienced, $1 million and $5 million producers in the financial adviser population. In our U.S. Trust team, we grew households by 9% last year. Andy Sieg and Katy Knox who have been recently added to my management team are driving continued success in these businesses. Our commercial and business banking continues to build relationships. Net new relationship additions increased 32% for global commercial banking, our middle market business, and 28% for business banking, comparing 2018 to 2017. And when you go on to the institutional investor side of the house, through our investments in the business and increased balance sheet commitment to our clients, we've seen an expansion in our prime brokerage business; and as a result, we had a record revenue year in our equities business. In the fourth quarter alone, we added 70 new clients for our equities team. As you turn to Slide 4, one of the drivers of an expansion in our client base is the fruit of multiple years of continuous improvement in our franchise. These investments have improved the capabilities and processes used to serve our customers, and we've added this talent and these capabilities without net expense growth. To enable this investment, we\u2019ve driven a culture of expense management as we reduced costs significantly over the past nine years while increasing our customer service scores and capabilities. This is why there\u2019s $30 billion annual reduction in our expense base since 2010. The team has done great work for you here accomplishing significant savings to the bottom line and at the same time industry-leading investment levels in technology and physical platform and talent. We face the same inflation and cost challenges everybody faces, benefit increases, wage increases, real estate cost increases, more investment, everything that we face and we still hit our 2000 [ph] expense target of approximately $53 billion. And as Paul will reiterate in a bit, we expect that - those expenses to remain in that neighborhood for 2019 and 2020; and this year, our efficiency ratio was at 58%. These expense reductions and increased revenue are a result of substantial operating leverage. Now take a look at Slide 5, 16 consecutive quarters of operating leverage, every quarter for four straight years. Even in periods of revenue decline, we were able to reduce expenses even more. During that four-year period, we have invested $12 billion in new technology initiatives, retooled every single ATM in the company, rehabbed 1,500 branches, built hundreds of new branches, added new administrative facilities and added relationship management and sales teammates, and we've also shared success with our teammates. Our shared success program we announced at the end of '17, we also continued beyond '18. The two programs combined added over $1 billion to 95 of the top - all but the top 5% of our team in annual compensation. If you go to the next slide, Slide 6, one of the things that helped us deliver these earnings and growth has been the netted -- increase in net interest income over the last several years. Once a while, I get asked by many - by you, \u201cdid you capture the value of the rate curve normalizing that you told us you would?\u201d The simple answer is yes and you can see it here, but we delivered more than that. On Slide 6, you see the improvement in NII every year since 2015. NII is up $8 billion in the past four years, but what we often miss here it wasn't solely driven by higher rates. It is driven by our business model, a business model which drives strong core deposit growth, coupled with strong pricing discipline, but it's also not just about deposits. Driving core NII takes good core loan growth as well and we can - and we have seen growth in loans across the business. This continues to strongly help NII growth. So you can see these on the right-hand side. Average deposits grew more than $150 billion after the past four years at a 4% compound annual growth rate. Loans in our business grew $140 billion or 6% CAGR over the same four years, but a specific point to demonstrate this. We have grown consumer checking balances at Bank of America for 40 quarters in a row, a stat our consumer team will be proud of, and by the way that was $200 billion in core checking of balances added across that decade. So as you look forward into 2019 and consider the beta where the NII can grow, short term rate increases stop or slow, we\u2019ll drive what we control with loan and deposit growth, and even in an unchanged rate environment, that should produce more NII. One of the areas - other areas for improvement has been a continued increase in the amount of capital we've been able to return to you, our shareholders. Take a look at Slide 7. As we've increased earnings, we have also increased the return of those earnings in the form of both increased dividends as well as share repurchases. This quarter, we crossed an important milestone for our team. Fully diluted shares moved under 10 billion, with more than 1.4 billion shares lower than the peak in 2013 and the lowest since 2009. It's the same great company, has more earnings, more capital, but 14% less shares than the peak and we see much more ahead. So we strive to deliver what we control; more customers, more activities from those customers whether it\u2019s loans, whether it\u2019s deposits, whether it's assets under management, whether it's underwriting fees, whether it's trading revenue, we continue to drive what we control and we control the risk and expenses, and we do this while driving our competitive advantage through increasing investments in people, technology, and physical [ph] plan. What does that sound like? It sounds like another year of driving responsible growth. Now, before I ask Paul to dive in the quarter, I wanted to give you - we're all facing a perceived change in the operating environment with predictions in the year ahead reflecting a range of outcomes from GDP growth in the mid 2's to lower growth to recession. I wanted to give you two perspectives, one from our research team, and the second from what we see in our client base. Let\u2019s first focus on the views of our research team, one of the best there is. The United States economy, largest in the world grew at a rate, the highest rate in the decade, long recovery in 2018. We still have low inflation, rising wages, low unemployment, and despite the increases in rates, interest rates remain at all-time lows. Our research team predicts economic growth to be lower in 2019 than it was in 2018, as do the general economic community. However, it is true these estimates still point to solid growth. For 2019, our research team has global GDP growth at 3.5%, and the research team has the US GDP growth at 2.5%, which is higher than any but one year in the last seven. But the second view is - our view is through our customers, and this strongly supports a solid growth view. In our consumer business, we processed in 2018 more than $2.8 trillion in consumer payments and cash consumption. That's a large sample of the US GDP. That data shows that the consumer spending was 8.5% higher for all of 2018 and 2017. That growth rate remained solid in December and January, even as comparables are increasing due to the strong growth in the end of '17 and early '18. We also see a lot of credit flows as one of the larger commercial and consumer lenders in the United States. Those flows are solid, reflecting customer confidence, responsible borrowing and lending. We talk to a lot of clients, we serve a lot of clients. We monitor their asset quality and we've seen it remain strong as net loss ratios are at record lows. We see no problems in near term horizon and expect charge-offs to remain around $1 billion or so for the next - for the rest of '19. We also see those companies as healthy, making more money and continuing to invest. Our small business clients remain optimistic, and our most recent survey shows that. The geopolitical comment, however, reflects all this. It provides a backdrop of uncertainty, trade wars, government shutdown, China slowdown, EU slowdown, Brexit you name it both here and abroad, impact people's economic growth outlook. We are mindful of those potential impacts, but we see in the US, strong indications of continued growth due to the benisons we have here in our economy. So, given the slowdown - given the slowdown predicted, it does not enervate us, it invigorates us. We look forward to continue to produce strong results in 2019, by driving responsible growth. With that, let me turn it over to Paul. Paul Donofrio : Thanks Brian. I'm starting on Slide 8 and referring to the highlights on Slide 9 as well. Bank of America reported net income of $7.3 billion or $0.70 per diluted share. As you recall, Q4 '17 included significant charges for the Tax Act. All the year-over-year results that I will review adjust for those charges. On that adjusted basis, comparing Q4 '18 to Q4 '17, we grew revenue 6%, pre-tax earnings 22%, net income by 39%, and with a 6% reduction in shares EPS by 49%. This growth was driven by 7% operating leverage and strong asset quality. The effective tax rate of 16% for the quarter included a net tax benefit of approximately $200 million related to a few items. The benefit was driven by updated tax guidance with respect to the Tax Act and international earnings. This benefit was partially offset by charges related to a variety of other tax matters. Year-over-year return on assets and equity improved significantly. Turning to the balance sheet on Slide 10, overall compared to the end of Q3 the balance sheet grew $16 billion, driven by commercial loan growth. Liquidity remained strong with average global liquidity sources of $544 billion and all liquidity metrics remained well above requirements. Long term debt declined $5 billion with maturities outpacing issuances. We are comfortably in compliance with the TLAC rules that became effective in January, especially in light of the recent reduction in our Method I G-SIB. Given our robust funding levels, we expect our parent debt issuances in 2019 will likely be less than maturities. Total shareholder equity increased $3 billion from Q3 as AOCI benefited from increases in the value of our AFS debt securities, given the decline in long end rates. We returned 95% of net income available to common or $6.7 billion, through the combination of dividends and share repurchases in the quarter. Turning to regulatory metrics, our CET1 standardized ratio improved 22 basis points to 11.6% from Q3 and remains well above our 9.5% requirement. The improvement was driven by the increase in AOCI that I just mentioned, combined with a modest decline in RWA. RWA decline was driven by lower global markets RWA and the sale of non-core consumer loans, which offset the impact of loan growth across the businesses. Looking at deposits on Slide 11, overall average deposits grew 4% year-over-year. A decline in non-interest-bearing deposits was isolated to mix shifts and Global Banking given the interest rate environment, while interest-bearing grew across every segment. Consumer banking deposits grew 3% as non-interest-bearing and low interest checking, which account for over half of consumer banking deposits grew 7%. While the aggregate of money market accounts, savings, and CDs were flat. GWIM also grew deposits, 3% year-over-year. GWIM's deposit balances benefited from market volatilities as customers moved from investments to cash. We also simplified client account structures for clients, which moved funds from off balance sheet sweep accounts to deposits. Global Banking deposits continue to grow well, up 9% year-over-year, reflecting the investments we have made in client-facing bankers and global treasury services capabilities. Also as mentioned earlier, in Global Banking, we saw expected rotation from non-interest-bearing to interest-bearing deposits. Turning to Slide 12, total loans, on an average basis, we're $934 billion. Total loan growth continued to be impacted by the runoff in sales of non-core consumer real estate loans. Near the end of the quarter and similar to last quarter, we sold a potential of mostly non-core consumer real estate loans with a book value of $5 billion, recording a small gain. Focusing on loans and our business segments, they were up $25 billion or 3% year-over-year. Consumer loans grew 4% year-over-year led by mortgage and to a lesser degree, consumer credit card. Commercial loans grew 2% year-over-year. As you think about starting loan levels for the new year, note that towards the end of the quarter, we originated several large primarily investment-grade financings, which resulted in loans ending the quarter $13 billion higher than the average for the quarter. While we would not call this a trend, we were pleased with the late quarter growth. Turning to Slide 13, net interest income on a GAAP non-FTE was $12.3 billion or $12.5 billion on an FTE basis. Compared with Q4 '17, GAAP NII was up $842 million or 7%. The improvement was driven by the value over deposits as interest rates rose as well as loan and deposit growth and was partially offset by higher funding cost in Global Markets and lower loan spreads. On a linked-quarter basis, GAAP NII was up $434 million. Linked-quarter growth reflects the benefit of the September rate hike, loan and deposit growth, and lower long-term debt expense. Net interest yield of 2.48% improved 9 basis points year-over-year and 6 basis points linked quarter. Strong improvement in our core banking activities was partially offset by the impact of lower yielding Global Markets assets. Including our global markets segment, which primarily reflects our trading-related assets, NII from core banking activities grew almost $1 billion year-over-year or 9%. The net interest yield on that same basis crossed 3% and is up 14 basis points year-over-year, driven by broad improvement in asset yields relative to funding costs. Average rate paid on interest-bearing deposits of 67 basis points rose 12 basis points from Q3 and is up 56 basis points versus Q4 '15, which was the beginning of this Fed rate hike cycle. Turning to asset sensitivity, as of 12/31, an instantaneous 100 basis point parallel increase in rates above the forward curve is estimated to decrease NII by $2.7 billion over the subsequent 12 months. The decrease since the end of September reflects the continued shift in Global Banking deposits to interest-bearing as well as modestly higher Global Banking pass-through rates. Note that the short end represents approximately 75% of this sensitivity. As you look forward to 2019, keep in mind Q1 has two less days of interest accrual, which will negatively impact NII by about $200 million. Turning to expenses. On Slide 14, we finished the year with another solid quarter of expense management. Compared to Q4 '17, non-interest expense of $13.1 billion was down 1%, continuing our quarterly string of year-over-year improvements. On a linked-quarter basis, expenses were flat as slower FDI insurance costs were offset by a couple of increases. First, we increased marketing in few areas including an investment to reposition our brand. And second, in October, we announced another shared success bonus covering 95% of our teammates. Despite these late-year investments, we reported full year expenses in line with our target, which was established in the middle of 2016 and our efficiency ratio improved to 58%. As we look ahead to 2019, we believe our full year expenses should approximate the 2018 expense level. This expense level includes approximately $1 billion for increased spending in the aggregate in several areas : Normal yearly merit, health care benefits primarily from inflation, marketing and the previously announced new investment initiative spending in technology as well as expansion and modernization of financial centers. On a full year basis, we believe we should be able to offset these investments through lower FDIC insurance and other efficiencies. With respect to Q1, note that expenses seasonally increase compared to Q4. In addition to any increase related to seasonal revenue in Q1, we anticipate that Q1 expense will be higher than Q4 '18 by approximately $500 million due to seasonal personnel costs, mostly payroll tax. We expect expenses should trend lower than Q1 through the remaining quarters of 2019. Turning to asset quality on Slide 15. Asset quality continued to perform very well. Total net charge-offs were $924 million lower than both the prior quarter and the year ago quarter. The net charge-off ratio declined to 39 basis points as losses declined while loans grew. Provision expense of $905 million more closely matched losses this quarter as we had a modest $19 million net reserve release. On Slide 16, we break out credit quality metrics for both our consumer and commercial portfolios. The only thing I would note here is we expect consumer seasoning drove credit card losses modestly higher, but the loss ratio to remain below 3%. Turning to the business segments and starting with the Consumer Banking on Slide 17. Q4 finished a strong year generating $12 billion in full year earnings. In Q4, earnings grew 52% year-over-year to $3.3 billion. We created more than 1,000 basis of operating leverage this quarter as revenue grew 10% while expenses were held flat. The all-in cost of running the deposit franchise was 159 basis points this quarter, which includes both the cost of deposits at 152 basis points and the average rate paid of 7 basis points. This total cost ratio declined from 165 basis points in Q4, '17. The efficiency ratio improved nearly 500 basis points year-over-year to 45%. Credit costs showed a modest increase, but remained low. As we viewed earlier, we grew Consumer Banking deposits 3% year-over-year and the percentage of check-in accounts that are now the primary account of a household increased to 91%. Consumer payments increased 7% year-over-year. Lending was also solid growing 5% year-over-year, and Merrill Edge brokered assets ended the quarter up $9 billion versus year-end 2017, as a $16 billion decline driven by market valuations, masked strong client flows of $25 billion for the full year, and customer activity in the quarter remained solid across all major product categories. Turning to Slide 18, you can see that 10% revenue growth was driven by NII as we realized the value of our deposits through our focus on relationship deepening. You will also note non-interest income improved year-over-year from account growth and higher levels of consumer spending. We experienced modest improvement in card income and service charges. As discussed previously, to promote relationship deepening, we reduced certain fees and we provide rewards and offer discounts when customers to do more with us. This may reduce fees, but overall drives revenue growth, especially NII. We believe this approach to customers combined with our leading capabilities has produced superior deposit growth relative to the industry average. We also believe it is driving customer satisfaction improvement, which is at an all-time high; and given expense declines, it's important to note the significant platform enhancements accomplished in the first half - excuse me, in the second half of 2018. We expanded in 26 new and existing markets in 2018. That included opening 81 new centers and in renovating more than 500. All our financial centers are now equipped with Wi-Fi. Turning to Digital Trends on Slide 19, just a couple of things to highlight. Mobile users continued to grow crossing over 26 million. We processed more than 2.5 trillion in total payments in 2018, and we saw digital as a percentage of all payments continue to grow in 2018, lowering costs, reducing errors, and improving customer convenience. Mobile and ATM now account for more than three quarters of deposit transactions. And mobile with all its benefits for our customers and our shareholders is now approaching half of all digital sales. Turning to Global Wealth and Investment Management on Slide 20, GWIM produced another quarter of strong results, delivering client flows totaling $35 billion, one of the best quarters of client flows in the company's history, which is partially due to growth in net new households. Net income of more than $1 billion was the best quarter ever for this segment, growing 43% year-over-year. Pre-tax income was up 18% and our pre-tax margin improved to nearly 29%. The business created more than 400 basis points of operating leverage, growing revenues 7% while holding expense growth to 2%. Revenue included solid growth in NII and noninterest income, overcoming some of the negative impacts of the decline in the financial markets early in the quarter. Asset management fees were up 3% versus Q4 '17, driven by a solid year of AUM flows, but were mitigated by a decline in brokerage fees. Revenue also included a roughly $100 million benefit from the sale of a noncore asset associated with industry [ph] sublicensing. It is important to note as you look at 2019 that the December drop in equity markets doesn't actually impact AUM fees until Q1 '19 due to the one-month lag in the determination of fees for assets under management. Moving to Slide 21. Trends reflected strong client engagement in Merrill Lynch and U.S. Trust. Strong household growth and continued near record low attrition of experienced financial advisors contributed to the $35 billion in overall client flows this quarter. AUM outflows in the quarter reflected market volatility, which impacted some clients' preferences versus cash and deposits. At the same time, we had $17 billion of positive brokerage flows, which is a record. We saw many of our new households begin their investment - investing relationship with us through a new brokerage account. On the banking side, we had deposit flows of $21 billion as some investors increased their allocation of cash, and ending loan balances grew $3 billion. Turning to Slide 22. Global Banking earned $2.1 billion and generated a 20% return on allocated capital. Global Banking achieved several records this quarter across revenue, net income, loan levels and deposit levels. Earnings were up 25% from Q4 '17, driven by operating leverage and tax rate benefits. Revenue of $5.1 billion and pre-tax earnings of $2.8 billion were both up modestly year-over-year. But this growth is understated given the impact of the Tax Act on tax-advantaged investments in Q4 '18 versus Q4 '17. Revenue was led by 4% growth in NII from strong deposit growth and higher rates but was offset by the small decline in investment banking fees. The business created operating leverage as expense declined 2% versus Q4 '17. Efficiency savings and lower deposit insurance costs more than offset continued investment in the business. Looking at trends on Slide 23 and comparing to Q4 last year. Since we already covered loans and deposits, I'll start with IB fees. IB fees of $1.3 billion for the overall firm decreased 5% year-over-year. For context, note the overall industry fee pool declined 13% from last year. Compared to Q4 '17, modestly improved M&A fees only partially offset a decline in underwriting fees given the significant weakness in financing fee pools as corporations and other participants assessed significant market volatility late in the quarter. Switching to Global Markets on Slide 24, I will talk about the results excluding DVA. Global Markets produced roughly $450 million of earnings in a tough quarter where market volatility increased and credit spreads widened. FICC and equity financial performance diverged with equity achieving record revenue. Overall revenue declined 10% compared to Q4 '17, while expenses declined 3%. Q4 '17 revenue included a small gain from the sale of a non-core asset. Sales and trading declined 6% year-over-year to $2.5 billion. FICC declined 15% while equities grew 11%. FICC's lower revenue was due to weakness in credit and mortgage markets and lower client activity in credit products. On the other hand, equities benefited. Market volatility led to increased client activity, producing revenue and improvements in both derivatives and in client financing activities where we have been recently investing. On Slide 25, I would just point out the chart on the bottom left, which shows at roughly $13 billion in full year revenues, the relative stability of sales and trading revenue over the past three years. It also shows the stability and benefit that comes from a full and diverse set of client solutions as growth in equity revenue has made up for the decline in FICC revenue. On Slide 26 we show all other, which reported net income of $279 million. Comparisons against the prior year are impacted by the charges in Q4 '17 associated with the Tax Act, which reduced revenue by $946 million and increased tax expense by $1.9 billion. As I mentioned earlier, Q4 '18 included a $200 million net tax benefit. Expenses improved $71 million year-over-year. Let me close with a couple of thoughts. Q4 was a solid finish to a record year of earnings. We controlled our costs well and invested in the future. Asset quality remains excellent. Our balance sheet is strong and we returned more earnings to shareholders and while the market may now believe interest rate hikes have stopped, we believe we can grow net interest income without rate hikes assuming modest levels of loan and deposit growth. With regard to things that are more in our control because of all the hard work our employees are doing to eliminate duplicative work and root out inefficiencies, we expect expense in 2019 to be roughly the same as 2018. And as Brian said, we also don't expect any meaningful change in net charge-offs in 2019, based on our years of responsible growth and our view of the credit horizon. So, we entered 2019 positively with a strong balance sheet and market share in businesses that positions us well for better earnings again in 2019. Thanks for listening, and with that let's open it up to questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take our first question from John MacDonald with Bernstein. Please go ahead. John McDonald : I was wondering on the loan growth front what you saw this quarter in terms of demand trends. You mentioned in commercial you saw the late quarter pick up, wondering if you attribute that to capital markets weakening. But underneath that, how is the core commercial demand; and overall, how are you feeling about loan growth prospects heading into 2019? And are you still thinking about GDP, GDP plus a little bit as you think about responsible growth in '19? Paul Donofrio : Yes we did see some late quarter pick up in loans and Global Banking. I'm not sure I can attribute it to the shutdown that we saw in the quarter in parts of the debt markets from a bond perspective, but I wouldn't be surprised if some of that pickup was from that. In terms of loan growth, in our consumer and GWIM segments, loan growth really continues to be solid and well within our expectations. As I said, consumer grew 5% year-over-year; GWIM grew 4%, which importantly is better than economic growth. In Global Banking, loan growth in Q4 was more subdued, but that's also consistent with industry data. Year-over-year loans grew 2%. I guess I would say that we think there are at least two factors impacting our corporate clients. First tax reform has increased cash flow and repatriation has also increased cash available for debt paydowns. But having said all that our near term expectations for loan growth are unchanged. We still expect total loan growth to be in the low-single digits, and growth in our business segments should be at mid-single digits. Maybe depending on economic growth on the low end of mid-single-digits, but we are still - we think we can achieve mid-single digits. John McDonald : And Paul just a follow-up, in terms of deposit pricing, what are your baseline expectations? You\u2019ve been able to hold deposit pricing very nicely while growing. What are your baseline expectations for deposit pricing if the Fed does slow? And just to clarify your NII outlook, as you go into the first quarter, what kind of offsets might you have to the day count headwind in terms of deposit growth and pricing? Paul Donofrio : Let's start with the NII outlook for Q1. The December rate hike and loan and deposit growth are clearly tailwinds, and we just think they'll be offset by two less trading days. I mean that's the best perspective I can give you. In terms of where do rates go from here, look I think Bank of America and indeed the rest of the industry really haven't increased deposit pricing on traditional bank accounts appreciably. And I think, again as I\u2019ve said many times, I think at least for Bank of America, we deliver a lot of value to depositors between transparency, convenience, safety, mobile banking, online banking, our nationwide network of financial centers, the rewards we give our clients, the advice and counsel, all that value I think has helped us keep deposit rates relatively flat in traditional retail accounts. But again, we have been raising rates in accounts in GWIM and in Global Banking. So we pass a lot of value through - in the form of higher deposits to those clients. At some point, the broader retail rates will rise. We just don't know when. So I think we're just going to have to wait and see. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Mike Mayo : Can you elaborate more on the checking deposit balance growth over the last year? It's up 7% or 8%. And I really want to get to the why? And Brian, I know you always say that you have good team members and everything else, but how much of that growth is due to mobile banking and digital banking? And of that component, how much would be due to millennials? Brian Moynihan : Mike to put it in perspective, I think we had $20-odd billion of fourth quarter '17 to fourth quarter '18 checking account growth in consumer. We actually -- as I said earlier, we have been in a decade-long repurposing of that business including focusing on primary accounts. So we're at 91% primary accounts. Accounts we add are accretive and solid. The average balance per account continues to grow. The satisfaction in that business hit an all-time high across the board in terms of customer delight. So it's a good performance, it\u2019s strong performance. But the key among all that is, basically, we are net growing checking accounts a few hundred thousand a year for the last couple of years, which we hadn't been for the last eight or nine years as we reposition the old product lines and did all the consolidations, even sold some branches you're well aware. To go to your question on millennials, there are 50 million households in consumer; 36 million digital households; 26 million mobile households. There are not enough millennials to meet those statistics. So this is a broad-based change going on, and whether it\u2019s people 80 years old, 70 years old, 60 years old, the way people use their capabilities that we have built for them is across the board. So any technology adoption, people often attribute to millennials, but when you think about that kind of penetration of digital practice, a 1.5 billion log-ins a quarter, you have 77% of the checks deposited not at the branch i.e. through ATMs and mobile deposits. You just don't have enough millennials to go around. So this is a broad-based trend that we've been driving and over the 10 years I talked about earlier, we had 6,100 branches, we have 4,200 branches. We have grown checking balances. It's just isn't enough millennials to make that happen. So it's a broad-based thing. I'll give you a - this quarter we crossed five million Zelle users, five million Erica users. Now remember, Erica is not even a year old, and five million Preferred Rewards customers who brought their relationship to get the benefits. That is what's driving this - the checking growth, because you get - if you bring all your relationships through the reward programs, we have that integrated across all products, not just card products that provides a good benefit. And so it's tremendous operating leverage as Paul mentioned, some of the statistics in cost It\u2019s tremendous client delight, it\u2019s tremendous capability, tremendous efficiency. It is broad-based comment. I mean, it's not - I mean, millennials would score high on something like Erica, but that would be expected. Long term it would be broadly adopted in our franchise. Mike Mayo : One follow-up, if I could. I've asked this before, but what is your market share of digital banking users or at least how much of that checking account growth over the last year is due to digital banking? Brian Moynihan : It's always hard to - our market share in consumer deposits we think is around, I don't know, 13% 14%, 15% depending on what you calculate Mike and it's growing. And if you look in the top 30 markets, 30 markets or 40 markets that we play in across the company - the country, excuse me, you can see that if you just follow the FDIC dating, CR deposit base continuing to grow. So, would it skew a little bit that way? Sure. Because younger people are opening up the relationships. I'd say that it's a little - if you look at it, the mobile adoption just to give you a sense, millennials are about 80%-plus, GenX are 72%, and boomers are 50% plus. So, it's across the Board. Operator : Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Please go ahead. Glenn Schorr : So the ROA and the ROTC came in well above where I think a lot of us might have thought a few years ago. So, I know credit is going to pick up some day, but I heard you loud and clear that economy is good; credit you expect flat; expenses you expect flat; and you've seen some modest growth. All that points towards - while you shrink the share count is a lot better profitability, so I'm just looking for your thoughts around where are the balance of where ROA and ROTC can go because we're in good and uncharted territory here. Brian Moynihan : I'm not sure I'd agree - I agree with everything you said until the very last part Glenn when you said good and uncharted. I mean this is - the ROAs are solid and the - if you think about it 100 basis points plus 100 a quarter, those are getting the numbers which are solid performance the ROTC. So, we had to - because of tax reform, those all moved up, we've moved that up to higher level now. And you're seeing us run at a rate which we'd expect to continue. With the economy growing couple of percent, if the economy shrinks or something, that's a different question. But we sort of stick to this model all the things you cited in your opening to your question is the model, right, which is grow revenue a little fast and economy, keep the investments flat, keep the credit risk in check, and drive that operating leverage and bring the share count down. So, you're saying what we're doing and I just - I'm not sure the returns will incrementally move up. There's a fundamental resetting obviously through not only the operating performance but the tax reform, but now they're growing forward a little bit, but they'll be in that range, 14% 15% 16% return on tangible common equity then maybe move up higher than that on a given quarter, but I think we're in a solid place right now. Glenn Schorr : Maybe one question on markets [fixed] particularly, I'll over generalize there too. Spreads widen out and markets does what it does. Volatility becomes bad for a little while when it happens quickly in fixed income as we saw. I know it's early, but spreads have tightened, liquidity's improved, markets are de-thawing. Directionally, can you recoup what was lost without putting numbers on it and if markets normalized? In other words, in the old days, the opposite would happen. Spreads tightened up and flows pick up and you can have great market environments. Has anything changed from the past? Brian Moynihan : Yes. I think the simple way to put it, it's all of two weeks into the quarter or whatever is that it's - we've seen a normal progression that you see from the fourth quarter to first quarter and it's solid out there right now and the equities business is stronger as we referenced earlier. But and all the thesis you had and all the pieces of it, but overall, our trading revenue has been fairly consistent every year. It came about at every quarter and every year differently, but it's basically been $13-odd billion sort of year after year after year with a range - I think a total range of maybe $500 million, $600 million, $700 million just to give you a sense. I don't have numbers right in front of me. So, the model was a moving model. And so there's not a lot of markdowns, markups stuff what you would've seen more in '08, '09. All the stuff marked to moving through at 100 miles an hour. There's no storage going on. So we've seen a recovery in the activity of clients. That's good news and you're probably seen with our clients and that's been good. So you've seen that pick up, but let's - we got to get through some things in the atmosphere out there and make sure that sustains for the quarter. Glenn Schorr : Tiny little follow-up on that is the average trading assets ticked up the last couple of years and your capital base improved. You put up good results and the bars going down while it's growing. Is there anything in that pick up in the trading-related assets that was just year-end parking as opposed to just bigger debt? Brian Moynihan : Remember the team in equities, Fab Gallo and team, they had to retool a lot of the platform, put a lot of technology. And about 24 months ago Tom Montag and the team said they're ready to start really pushing our capabilities out in the market and as I said earlier, we've got 70 new clients in the fourth quarter. Our equities business so the balance sheet growth has been in support of the equities business. And it's - remember it's very low risk, very low RWA, but that's been fairly consistent build over time. It will ebb and flow a little bit by market value because of the way it works. But it's really because the equities business is - with the investments made technology and capabilities and now turned out into providing balance sheet capacity and capabilities is a prime brokerage business. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Betsy Graseck : A couple of questions. One is just a question on how you expect to be managing in the event that the downside happens. So what if some of the negative things pan out and revenues come in a little bit lighter? Can you talk through where you have expense leverage, if you have any or do you keep the expenses flat in a tougher environment? Brian Moynihan : I think assuming an environment of \u2013 was the GDP decline is I think what the base of your question is, you would see - you obviously probably see a market decline that will bring incentive-related compensation down that instantaneously happens. And frankly, if we're not earning as much that's obviously an outcome and so there will be those types of things. But we could always choose not to invest, but I think if you look at what we're investing in and you'd say, 'keep going.' Honestly as a shareholder, it will be a better answer for the company because the technology investments allow us to take long-term expenses down and things like that. So yes, there's always leverage you can pull. But that's - the business model we're operating for many years now has been the constantly pulling those levers with time that allows you to manage a company much more carefully and allows attrition to be a front in terms of headcount. But the key is to just keep driving our operating leverage. So if revenues flatten, you've got to get the expenses down a little bit to make it all work and keep it positive and we're focused on it. So let's see what happens. We'll see - you have to kind of have what the constituent parts of the backdrop are. But mechanically some of the expenses come down just due to pure revenue-related incentives. Betsy Graseck : So even if the revenue environment is a little weaker, you think you can generate positive operating leverage? Brian Moynihan : Well, we've been able to do it. If you look at - go back and look at that chart on quarterly operating leverage, it has come in quarters where revenues fell. And so that - and that's the key is, it may not be as big, in other words the net operating leverage, but the culture we built in this company to operating excellence and simplify and improve and the idea generation, whereas 4200 ideas over the last four-five years. We're continuing to generate them. We're looking at every single process and taking apart mapping and understanding, understand what data flows, how we can automate it? And it's very incremental. Those are not huge spend $1 billion and see if it works. When you add them all up, we do spend $1 billion, but it's a bunch of small projects. So those are always moving down into our benefit as we move through it. And so I think if you look at that operating leverage, yeah if revenues were flat. Just say because of whatever is was going on there we should be able to manage expenses underneath it. Betsy Graseck : And then could you speak a little bit to the investment spend that you're making in the investment bank and in particular in which geographies you're really looking to increase your market share? Brian Moynihan : Right, I think the U.S. being the biggest fee pool as people talk about it by far, we continue to do that. We feel pretty good about the team we have in Asia, we feel - in Europe we're going to add some there, but the real key is to cover deeper in the client base. Outside the United States, we cover the largest companies in the world, the largest investors of the world. Inside the United States because of the nature of the business we cover from small businesses all the way through the largest companies. And the piece that we probably gave up coverage on that we got to go back and is sort of the upper end of the middle market and the broader base. And so, we're adding resources - middle market investment bankers that work with Alastair Borthwick's team with Matthew Koder's team working with them to drive it. We're adding more coverage deeper in the industry groups. And so it's a broadening out of the U.S. will be there - in the North America will be the biggest sort of explicit build you'll see. But a lot of it is just filling in the cracks and making sure that we've got that coverage really owned from - in the United States from the smallest company, the largest company for all their capital markets needs and M&A needs and then outside, it's really picking our industries and our fine-tuning, which we've done. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Steven Chubak : So wanted to start-off with a question on capital return. Capital ratios ended the year flat versus 4Q, '17. It stands at an impressive 11.6%. I think it's fair to say that you're currently operating with substantial levels of excess capital. And just given your strong track record and the stress test, as we look to benchmark against how much capital return you could support or what you're sufficiently comfortable with you did 96%. I think that there was number that was cited in the prepared remarks. Are you in a position at this point, especially given some of the recent decline in the share price to take full advantage and may be exceed 100% pay out in the coming stress test cycle? Brian Moynihan : Well, look let me just start out with a couple of level setting points. We clearly as everyone has seen been growing our capital return to shareholders consistently for many years now. So that's one a point. We increased our dividend 25% last year. We increased our buybacks by $8 billion. And last year, when you put it all together based upon what we submitted, we were at 100% a little over 100% payout ratio. If you look at our CCAR results, which you alluded to, we do have a significant cushion using the fed's results. Considering I guess the severity of last year's scenario and as you point out our cone capital cushion, we would hope expect to have room to, at a minimum, sustain that payout ratio, if not increase it. But we got to see this scenario first. That's the one caveat. Steven Chubak : And just one follow-up on some of the remarks relating to TLAC. Increased issuance of TLAC-eligible debt, while this is may be an underappreciated fact, it's been a substantial dampener of NII expansion over the last few years. And Paul, show me you can update us on where that ratio sits today? Just trying to get - and whether there's a target level that you're thinking about? I'm just trying to gauge what the opportunity is to optimize that TLAC ratio? How you could think about the substantial - the potential benefit from replacing that with cheaper deposit funding? Paul Donofrio : Yes. We are not disclosing what our TLAC ratio is, but I will say that as we sit here today, we have a comfortable cushion and as you also heard in my prepared remarks the debt issuances this year are going be likely to be less than maturities. Steven Chubak : Looking forward to more updates in the future. Just one final follow-up from me on credit loss expectation. Brian, you made an interesting remark at a conference recently in December noting that you expect through the cycle lost expectations that come in well below 90 basis points, but at the same time, didn't really commit to an explicit level of expectation. And given the late cycle rhetoric, the focus on - particularly from loan only is with longer horizons as to what through the cycle loss expectations might be and all the balance sheet cleansing you accomplished, I was wondering if you can maybe provide us with some sort of benchmark or target expectation that we can compare your guys against versus peers just given many have provided at least medium term or through the cycle loss expectations already? Brian Moynihan : Earlier I said what I expected for '19 charge-offs in the range of where they are kind of now. The point that I think we were talking about at the conference is around the construction of portfolio versus what they were last cycle - for this cycle for us. We had a $250 billion unsecured consumer credit card and other types of unsecured debt. So, just sheer volume that is completely different and that took frankly a lot of work to get us repositioned to where we have it. So just using that example and if you look at charge-offs go back in 2010 I think there were $30 odd billion in the year and a big part of those credit card and related unsecured debt restructuring credit card loans. That was due to the fact in the mid 2000s where the best data analytics the best underwriting team in the business we are underwriting with a 5% charge-off expectation and a good economy. And it turned out to be a bad economy, it turned out to be consumer-led problem and that led to much higher charge-offs. So you can then run that same story through home equities and other things. And so, if you look at the size of the consumer book, it's much smaller. Then you turn - flip it over and talk about the quality underwriting. So now our expectations are 3.5%, 4% charge-off rate in a 7%, 8% unemployment type levels versus five 5%, 6% before and moving on beyond there. So that you both the rate and the volume question on home equity in unsecured consumer credit that is much different and then you go to mortgage same story. Then you flip over to commercial credit we've always had wonderful commercial credit experience. Go back the 1990s - the mid-late 90s through the fallen angel crisis go back through the last crisis and we underwrite commercial credit I think better than anybody in the business. And yet we still have balance there and you see us - the ray of risk is across-the-board. We've managed the limits at the industry level, at the country level and all that stuff. And so we expect the outcome to be even better than it was last time there and we watched the snake and all the different things that give us that comfort. But the real test is just look at the stress test. And so if you look at the stress test and say under that scenario with no preparation, no ability to change during that nine quarters, if you look at card, if I remember right at the top of my head, I think the total charge offs for the nine quarters are around, I don't know 11%, 12% something like that. If you de-annualize that, you think of that - under that scenario if unemployment go from four-ish to the pace that goes up then you end up with about a 5% to 6% per year - at a 5% per year. That just shows the difference in the underlying quality, but it was a conscious effort to give up a lot of revenue to get the company more balanced, so that through a crisis it would perform completely different. All that I'm not going to give you a target, because I don't have a scenario, I'm giving the target that will be much better than the last time. Steven Chubak : And despite no explosive target, a very helpful color. So, thank you, Brian for taking my questions and all the insights. Operator : Our next question is from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Matt O'Connor: I was wondering if you could talk about just your thoughts on managing interest rate risk, given the drop in most parts of the curve, lowered expectations for future short hikes and then maybe specifically the securities book. Is it worth, kind of, reinvesting proceeds into securities? Or do you keep it shorter hoping for a backup in rates? Brian Moynihan : So first thing to think about as we look at that securities book we're always, always, always balancing earnings against capital and liquidity. That\u2019s dynamic process that happens daily, certainly weekly. We don't take any credit risk in that investment portfolio. That's the other thing I always like to stress when we talk about it. So, we look at it and we're always trying to figure out whether we should do a little bit more of this or a little bit less of that. If you looked at this quarter by the way we did, we have a little bit less sitting at the Fed because we did some overnight, very high-quality reverse repo because the yields were just higher. So, yeah we're looking at it. We look at it all the time. Matt O'Connor: And I guess from a NIM percent perspective, I realize there\u2019s some puts and takes specifically with the trading book. But in the stable rate environment you did mention you can grow the net interest income dollars, can you get ability in the NIM. So, should we really think about it as the NII being driven by balance sheet or is there some risk that the NIM erodes a little bit in a stable rate environment? Brian Moynihan : We look at it. I mean, if you look at Q1, I would expect NIM to edge up a little bit driven by loan growth funded by low-cost deposits. Longer term, NIM\u2019s really going to depend on the forward curve and our ability to lag deposit rate paid. Matt O'Connor: And then just separately if I could squeeze in, did you guys comment on the tax rate for 2019? Sorry if I missed that. Brian Moynihan : I don't think we did actually. We were expecting an effective tax rate for 2019 of approximately 19% absent unusual items. Operator : Our next question is from Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead. Jim Mitchell : Maybe if you could just talk a little bit about leveraged lending risk, how you think about it, how you manage it? Obviously, that's been a big topic lately given the freezing of the markets in December in particular. Just your thoughts, I guess from here around your own book and maybe the industry? Brian Moynihan : Sure. So the first thing I would say is look we're staying focused and have been focused on responsible growth. So, we are maintaining our underwriting standards and we're staying within, and have now for years stayed within our portfolio limits. Our exposure to leveraged lending is primarily through underwriting and distributing leveraged loans. We have very little, for example, CLO exposure at the company because as I just pointed out, we don't hold that kind of risk in our investment portfolio. Having said that, leveraged finance is a very important part of our franchise, and if it's done well, it supports economic growth. Our leveraged finance franchise does well over $1 billion. So, nothing's really changed for us. If you're going to be in this business, if you're going to be a leader in this business as we are, you've got to be there when the markets good and when the market's not and we are, but we're doing it our way, sticking to our standards. Jim Mitchell : How do you manage sort of size, getting -- just any thoughts and have you taken down the amount you're willing to put on the balance sheet at least in the short term? Or how do we think about how you manage today versus what you did a year ago? Brian Moynihan : As I said earlier to a response to another question, we're in the moving business not the storage business. So, we have limits for the transitory process of doing the underwritings. So, we mark them and move them out and it's gone. And so, this is not how much - as Paul said, we don't - we make lots of commercial credit available to our clients, but in this part of the - in the underwriting part of the business, which is what you're talking about, it all goes out the door. Jim Mitchell : And maybe just a question on CECL. Any thoughts on the impact, and I guess given some of the pushback, do you see any parts of it changing? Just your thoughts on CECL? Brian Moynihan : So, in terms of the impact, we're not at the point yet where we're providing an estimate. We have made a ton of progress on our efforts towards adoption. However, there's still a lot of things that need to be finalized before we're really ready to talk about impacts. I would point out that we're not overly concerned at this point, and it certainly is not going to change how we're going to serve our clients. Having said that, we may see an increase in allowance upon adoption, maybe, maybe not. It's ultimately just going to depend on the economic outlook and credit conditions as of the adoption date in 01/01/2020. The only other issue out there is sort of the double count in CCAR and how it's going to affect capital. And with respect to that, I think the regulators and us are thinking about a lot of things, but the only two I would point out is we just need to understand the implications on capital and how it affects the willingness of banks to extend credit. As I said before, I don't think it's going to change how we operate our company. If CECL is in, the company runs stress test, but not in the Feds, what are the implications of that? There are still a lot of things to work out here between now. And I think that's why they delayed the implementation of CECL in the stress test until 2022? Yes, 2022, I think. Yes. Operator : Our next question is from Saul Martinez with UBS. Please go ahead. Saul Martinez : Most of my questions have been asked. But I'll just follow up I guess on the earlier question on your - what a Fed pause would mean for your NIM and I think you mentioned Paul that it really depends on the forward curve and the ability to lag on deposit rates. But I guess on that point, how much of a risk do you see of a lag that's back on deposits rates, specifically on retail deposit rates, which really haven't moved much in this rate-tightening cycle. How much of a risk do you see that in an environment where because [ph] economy is still doing okay that we do see sort of a lagged effect and you start to see some - a bit more deposit cost pressure on the retail side than maybe we've seen up until now? Paul Donofrio : Yes, what we - so think about it. I think if I got it right, it was two Fed rates three years ago; three, two years ago; and four last year something like that. So if you just sort of noodle in and look at the different movement from the end of '17 to the end of '18 given - and think of it as a live basis, I think that what was embedded in it, there just isn't a lot of movement because they're checking accounts and checking accounts never have high interest rates on them and half of them are non-interest-bearing, so they don't have any interest rate on them. So I think, it really comes down to who the customer is, how they use the cash or is it transactional cash, is it investment cash either short term or long term and each business line is different. But in the consumer business, what is driving our deposit growth is the $20 billion from fourth quarter 2017 to fourth quarter 2018 and checking balance growth, which will always be tremendously advantaged from the perspective you're coming at which is a funding basis. And as they grow, we don't feel - there's not a lot of pressure because half of it is non-interest-bearing accounts. You can just go back and look at the pricing across time in these businesses and see what's happened if you sort of look at it, and I think you'll feel that we should be able to consistently drive that. In the rate sensitive side i.e. where it\u2019s investment cash, the rates have moved up substantially already and we're growing those balances. So we tell our team to price to grow deposits 3%, 4% better than - i.e. better than the economy and they've got to achieve that balance and they've done a great job. Saul Martinez : I guess on the - you may also - just another question. You made the point that the equity market downturn in December will hit fees in the first quarter, and we can obviously do our own calculations and look at the roll forward and the asset values. But is there any way to sort of size up what the magnitude of the downturn in the fourth quarter, the markets could mean for fees in that business? Paul Donofrio : Look it's a good question. I wouldn't hesitate to give you a number because the revenue is based upon a lot of different things besides just what the level of the markets are. I think it kind of would be misleading to come up with a number just based upon the markets to everybody on this call. So maybe if you could call back and Lee and his team can help you think through what the issues are more broadly but we're not going to give a number today. Operator : We do have one final question from Brian Kleinhanzl. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Brian Kleinhanzl : Yes, I hear you on the net charge-off guidance for 2019 relative to 2018, but how are you thinking about reserve builds? I mean reserve releases were $500 million this quarter, are you still thinking about - are you able to release reserves at that pace next year as well? Brian Moynihan : Yes, look we think - just to run through it for everybody, we think that provision, we think credit is going to continue to perform well, and hopefully everybody heard that on the call. And we would expect provision to roughly match net charge-offs depending on loan growth. You heard us talk about what we\u2019re expecting for net charge-offs. The releases are coming down. You saw they're $19 million this quarter. And we just rough - you're going to see our provision much more closely match net charge-offs going forward because we've seen a lot of improvement in that consumer real estate portfolio. So that's the best guidance I can give you. Brian Kleinhanzl : And then just one follow-up still on credit, I mean you did say that kind of the commercial NPLs picked up this quarter. It's been a pretty steady downward trend. And those since 2016, is it just because of market conditions or could you give a little bit more color there as to why the uptick in this quarter? Thanks. Paul Donofrio : Yes sure. Look at 22 basis points, NPLs as a percentage of loans is basically at a historic low here. There was an increase in the quarter driven by a couple or a few names that were downgraded. If you look at reservable criticized exposure, it continues to fall in the quarter. So again we don't see anything suggesting a broad based decline in the overall credit quality. Lee McEntire : Okay. I think that's all the questions. So thank you for joining us again. We had a strong solid quarter in 2018 with a strong year for this company, a record earnings. As we look forward in 2019, as I said earlier, the predictions of potential slowdown in the economy don't enervate us, they invigorate us. We\u2019ve built this company to operate in that setting. We'll continue to drive responsible growth and we look forward talking to you next quarter. Operator : And this will conclude today's program. Thanks for your participation. You may now disconnect and have a great day.",

Later, you\u2019ll have the opportunity to ask questions during the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please note this call is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Mr. Lee McEntire. Please go ahead. Lee McEntire : Good morning. Thanks for joining this morning's call to review our 1Q 2019 results. By now I trust that everyone has had a chance to review the earnings release documents which are available on the Investor Relations section of bankofamerica.com website. Before I turn the call over to the CEO, Brian Moynihan, let me remind you that we may make forward-looking statements during the call. After Brian's comments, our CFO, Paul Donofrio, will review the details of the 1Q results. After that we'll open it up for all of your questions. For further information on forward-looking comments, please refer to either our earnings release documents, our website, or our SEC filings. With that, take it away, Brian. Brian Moynihan : Thank you, Lee and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us this morning to review our first quarter of 2019 results. In the first quarter, we\u2019ve reported $7.3 billion of net income after-tax, the best quarter in the company's history. So let's begin on slide two. This slide shows the building blocks in achieving another record quarter. It also shows our commitment to responsible growth and how it drives our shareholder model. We reported diluted EPS of $0.70, which grew 13% from the first quarter of 2018. This reflects a nice mix of both operating improvements and capital returns. Pre-tax income of $8.8 billion, grew 4%, you could see that in the upper right. And we generated operating leverage of more than 400 basis points, which you can see in the lower right. Asset quality remains strong as net charge-offs remained around $1billion, the same level it have been for several quarters. Provision expenses up year-over-year to match those net charge-offs more closely. And we had a small reserve build this quarter against the net reserve release last year. Through disciplined capital deployment after meeting all the requirements to make loans to our customers and support their businesses, we continue to drive our share count lower. You can see that in the lower left. We are well underway with our goal to bring out the dilution in shares caused by the increased capital build after the crisis. Through share buybacks, our diluted shares are down 7% compared to the first quarter of 2018 and down 1.5 billion shares in the past four years. Turning to slide three, part of responsible growth is to produce sustainable results and part of that is to drive operational excellence, and we did it again this quarter. As you can see on slide three, we extended our positive operating leverage streak to 17 consecutive quarters. As you think across the last four years or so, we've had many different markets out there, many different interest rate environments, many different changes and perceptions in the U.S. economy and the global economy. All those things affect our business in a given quarter. But what has been constant behind that is our ability to drive operating leverage. We achieved it differently in different quarters, but as shown here, we achieved it consistently. When you think of our company, the three broad and diverse buckets of revenue, two which has annuity like characteristics, and one is more susceptible to prevailing market conditions. The first bucket to spread revenue from loans and deposits, and the second bucket is recurring fees, like our cash management fees in our commercial business or consumer account fees or interchange and things like that. The third bucket of revenue, which are more market related would be the sales and trading revenue, the investment banking fees and asset management brokerage revenue, which are both dependent on market levels at a given moment and market activity given rise to those levels. So if you think about this quarter versus last year, our market related types of revenue was down 12%. The other two non-market related revenue sources were up 7%, that shows you the diversity in this company and all-in that ended up with flat revenue growth. However, our laser like focus on expense management came to the table again and resulted in the year-over-year expense decline of 4%, which resulted in the 400 basis points of operating leverage. All you can see as you move to the right hand side of slide three. When you think about how we're driving the company, while managing expenses we continue to invest in the future. Our expenses have come down from $57 billion to $53 billion and change over the last four years or so. And we've been driving the operating leverage in each quarter, during that time, but we also continue to invest deeply in our franchise. And why do we do that, because it is working, we're getting more business as we add relationship management capacity, increase our marketing and drive deeper penetration of U.S. markets through the full franchise entry and more and more markets across United States. We also continue to invest in our people, with industry leading benefit plans, in both in health and retirement, with industry leading capabilities and universities to train and reskill our teammates, and plus deploy the Pay Plan we announced recently, where we\u2019re going to increase our minimum wage over the next 26 months from $15 an hour plus to $20 an hour. We need to do that because we need the best teammates to make this great company work and work for our clients. Across the company, we added 500 new sales professionals this quarter, more consumer relationship bankers, more wealth advisors, more commercial bankers and more business bankers, more small business bankers and more investment bankers. And as we had discussed many times, our initiative of spending for technology has been running around $3 billion for many years now, but is currently due to savings from tax reform expected to be 10% higher in 2019. We continue to enhance both our physical network for delivering products and services to clients as well as the facilities we operate in communities and countries around the globe. All in Bank of America invest around $2 billion a year in capital expenditures to build out and enhance our buildings, facilities and infrastructure. As it relates to our financial centers, our ATMs and other physical build out. The point is we haven't just announced what we'll do. We're halfway through the broad based build out in our consumer business. We're executing plan we laid out several years ago. But importantly for you, the cost to complete the work is already embedded in all our expense guidance. It's in fact embedded in our current run rate. So we drive operating leverage and we invest and we see returns on that investment. One of the ways that we get our return on that investment is through our digital capabilities. Each quarter we show you the charts on slide five of our digital customer statistics. Because as I discussed them with many of you, we sometimes miss the obvious, what is driving this trend, is the change in our customers\u2019 behavior. We will continue to serve our customers in every manner possible. The customer can have their cake and eat it too if they could have digital, physical 24 hours a day cash and electronic payments, checks and wires and ACH, a loan officer an online application to fulfillment of their mortgage. It is their choice. 37 million digital users now with 27 million of those mobile, and we now have 27% of our sales transacted digitally. 77% of our deposit transactions are now done through digital means. This means more of our financial centers teammates and their time can be devoted to important events in the client\u2019s financial wise. We welcome 800,000 customers a day into our financial centers, and they remain very important to our capabilities. And we continue to invest in those financial centers, upgrade them and make them more modern. And while consumer payments goes slowed from 8% to 9% pace of a year ago to the 3% pace in the first quarter of 2019 over the strong quarter in first quarter of 2018. That's still amounted to over $700 billion in payments in the quarter. An example was part of those payments you can see in the Zelle uses have grown to more than 5 million active users and we processed $16 billion of payments for them this quarter. So if you look at the drivers of our income, let's go to slide six. We'll spend a couple minutes on client activity on these matters. Average total deposit grew $63 billion on a year-over-year basis. This is our 14th straight quarter of growth of $40 billion or more organic deposit growth versus the prior year. Global banking grew deposits in the 8% pace as did wealth management. Consumer banking deposits grew by 3%, consumer core checking grew 7% from last year, showing more households are choosing us to be their core bank. Our pace of growth has consistently exceeded the industry's growth rates, customers value the capabilities rewards of their relationship and continue to see lower attrition and 90% plus primary bank status. In addition, wealth management also saw a strong growth of deposits in new relationships. Our Global Banking team continues to benefit from strong customer demand as we continue to deploy bankers and treasury officers across our franchise. Within Global Banking, you will note that commercial customers move balances from non-interest bearing to interest bearing as a treasury credit rate we give them for their balances to pay for their services rises, they [indiscernible] with us, non-interest bearing balances. However, this change stabilizes when the rate curve stabilizes as it has. As we go to slide seven, let's talk about average loans. The good news is the average impacted late fourth quarter growth we spoke to you about last call was complemented by further good growth during the first quarter. Particularly promising was a strong rebound in our middle market customer base, where we saw growth and line usage increase. This means middle market companies are increasing their loan activity as they draw lines to finance raw material purchases, payrolls and other investments. Overall, from a corporate top of the house level, we grew loans 1%. However, looking at across our business segments, core loans grew $33 billion or 4% on a year-over-year basis. That's consistent with our responsible growth model. The lower left hand chart shows the core business growth has been consistent across the last five years or more; consistent growth, consistent with the responsible growth for several years. And the growth rate improved this quarter. In fact, this quarter our ending balances in commercial banking shows the highest linked quarter growth rate in the last six years. As we move to slide eight, you can see the highlights for the quarter. I've covered a lot of the core points here, but I want to focus a little bit on returns. Despite a modest increase in the average balance sheet our return on assets in the company was 126 basis points and improve both on year ago and sequential quarter basis. Our return on tangible common equity was 16%. Our efficiency ratio continued to move down to 57% from 59.5% last year. With that, let me turn it over to Paul to walk you through more details of our first quarter results. Paul? Paul Donofrio : Good morning, everyone. I'm starting on slide 10 since Brian already covered the P&L. Overall, compared to the end of Q4; the balance sheet grew $23 billion, driven by the equity financing business. Liquidity remained strong with average global liquidity sources of $546 billion and all liquidity metrics remained well above requirements. Long-term debt increased $4 billion, common shareholders\u2019 equity increased $1.7 billion from Q4, as the value of our AFS debt securities benefited from the decline in loan and interest rates, thereby increasing AOCI. Partially offsetting the increase was the return of more capital than we earned this quarter. We returned $7.7 billion, or 112% of the net income available to the common through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. Turning to regulatory metrics, total loss absorbing capacity rules became effective in January, and at the end of March our TLAC ratio comfortably exceeded our minimum requirements. Our CET1 standardized ratio was flat at 11.6% from Q4 and remained well above our 9.5% regulatory requirement. The ratio was flat, because the increase in AOCI mentioned earlier was offset by higher RWA primarily in global markets. Turning to slide 11, I want to spend a few moments on NII given the changes in the rate environment. Net interest income on a GAAP, non-FTE basis was $12.4 billion; $12.5 billion on an FTE basis, compared to Q1 2018 GAAP NII was up $606 million or 5%. The improvement was driven by the value of our deposits as interest rates rose, as well as loan and deposit growth, partially offset by lower loan spreads. On a linked-quarter basis, GAAP NII was down $128 million. In Q1, we benefited from yields rising on our floating rate assets as short-term rates rose. We were also disciplined with respect to deposit pricing, and we benefited from loan and deposit growth, particularly commercial loan growth. However, higher short-term rates also increased the cost of our long-term debt and other global market funding costs. Additionally, lower mortgage rates muted the benefits from increased short-term rates. The net of all these things was still a benefit in the quarter. However, this net benefit only partially mitigated the seasonal impact in Q1 from two less days of interest, which costs us roughly $180 million. Net interest yield of 2.51% improved 9 basis points year-over-year, but was down 1 basis point linked quarter. Deposit rates in our Wealth Management and Global Banking businesses increased however, we saw minimal movement in our consumer business. Overall, the average rate paid on interest bearing deposits of 160 -- of 76 basis points rose 9 basis points from Q4 and is up 40 basis points versus Q2 2018. That compares to an average increase in Fed funds of 97 basis points year-over-year. Turning to the asset sensitivity of our banking book, the drop in long-end rates increased our assets sensitivity, compared to year-end. In addition, we are now modeling modestly lower deposit pass-through rates given our experience in this rate cycle. Given the recent moves in rates, I thought, I would provide some perspective on NII for the rest of the year. On a full year basis, NII grew 6% in 2018, in a rising rate environment and an economy that grew approximately 3%. The economy is expected to grow more moderately in 2019. And rate expectations have been lowered. Plus, we have some seasonal headwinds in Q2. But through loan and deposit growth, and picking up two additional days of interest over the next couple of quarters. We would expect growth in NII to be consistent with or slightly better than growth of the general economy. More specifically in Q2 typically sees higher funding of client activity in global markets related to the European dividend season, which aids trading revenue but reduces NII. We also typically see less benefit from loan growth, driven by paydowns on year-end credit card balances in Q2. Finally, long-end rates have fallen across Q1 and remain lower, this should drive higher prepayment of mortgage backed securities, which will cause bond premium write-off. These headwinds will be partially mitigated by one additional day of interest accruals. Across the second half of the year, we expect NII to benefit from growth in loan and deposits as well as an additional day of interest in Q3. Ultimately, we expect NII for the year -- for the full year of 2019 to be up roughly half the pace of 2018. This perspective assumes today's forward curve and loan and deposit growth consistent with the current economic environment. Turning to expenses on slide 12, we continued to improve efficiency at $13.2 billion, we were down $618 million or 4% compared to Q1 2018. This reflected efficiencies from a full year of work across the enterprise to simplify and improve our processes, as well as lower FDI insurance costs. We also reduced managers and management layers over the last year, cutting bureaucracy and complexity. By the way, in terms of headcount, we are replacing many of these managers with sales professionals. We also saw an end to some intangible amortization in our Merrill business related to the merger 10 years ago. Compared to Q4 2018, expenses are up $149 million, due to seasonally elevated payroll tax expense, partially mitigated by timing of marketing and tech initiative plans. In addition, 4Q was elevated by the mismatch between accounting for certain deferred benefit programs and the accounting for related hedges as the overall market declined in Q4, this went the other way in Q1, with the market\u2019s rebound. Our efficiency ratio improved to 57%. I would also note that we filed an 8-K earlier this year, in which we reclassified some expense to revenue resulting in an approximately $200 million reduction in full year 2018 expense. With respect to expense levels for full year 2019 and 2020, as you know, we increased for 2019 our planned level of initiative spending, supporting both physical and digital expansion and we made announcements of further investments in our people like our minimum wage increase, despite these increases, we still believe we will meet our target of reporting expense for the next two years that approximate our reclassified 2018. However, please note, that the quarterly progression of expenses in 2019 may look a little different than the past years, as it will be impacted by the timing of planned technology and marketing spend. Turning to asset quality on slide 13, asset quality continue to perform well, driven by long-term adherence to responsible growth and a solid U.S. economy. Net charge-offs were $991 million, $80 million higher than Q1 2018 and $67 million higher than Q4. Comparing to Q4, we saw typical seasonality in our credit card portfolio. Compared to the prior year, we continued to see modest seasoning in our credit card portfolio. In Q1, there was also one charge-off related to a single utility client, which increased losses by $84 million impacting comparisons against both periods. The net charge-off ratio was 43 basis points. The loss ratio has now been below 50 basis points, in all but three quarters of the past five years. Provision expense was a little more than $1 billion and closely matched losses this quarter. Provision included a modest $22 million net reserve build. Looking forward, we expect net charge-offs to approximate this quarter\u2019s $1 billion level for each of the remaining quarters in 2019, assuming current economic conditions continue. On slide 14, we broke out credit quality metrics for both our consumer and commercial portfolios. Here you can see both the seasonal increase in consumer losses as well as the impact of the commercial charge-off, I mentioned. With respect to consumer metrics, both delinquencies and non-performing loans trended lower, which we believe is a good indicator of future asset quality. In commercial, we did have a modest increase in non-performing loans and reservable criticized exposure, but as a percent of loans, both metrics remain near historic lows. Turning to the business segments and starting with consumer banking on slide 15. Earnings grew 25% year-over-year to $3.2 billion.Q1 reflects continued strong momentum from 2018 as deposits grew $23 billion or 3%, revenue grew 7% and expenses were down 4%, creating operating leverage of 11%. Despite the expanded physical footprint, the all-in cost of running the deposit franchise declined 6 basis points year-over-year to 1.64%, which includes both the cost of deposits as well as rates paid. The efficiency ratio has now declined to 45%, credit cost remain low. The net charge-off ratio was 128 basis points, increasing only one basis point year-over-year. With respect to client activity, we continued to increase the number of accounts, while maintaining primary account status above 90%. More customers enrolled in preferred rewards, more customers use our digital channels for service as well as sales and more customers use our expanded and enhanced physical delivery network. We remain healthy growth and consumer spending has slowed to 3%. This seems quite natural following two years of spending growth above historical averages, especially given the backdrop of an economy, which has modestly slowed. And remember, growth in spending in Q1, 2018 was fueled by confidence following tax reform in late 2017. Consumer lending was also solid growing 5% year-over-year. The recent dip mortgage rates has improved momentum in the mortgage market on both refinance and purchases originations were up 22% from Q4. With respect to small business owners, we've been investing in our capabilities. For example, we've streamlined underwriting, enhanced credit card features and added specialist. Loans to small businesses are quickly approaching the $20 billion level, up 6% year-over-year. Solid activity with consumers is also evident in the growth of our investment assets. Investment assets in the Consumer segment, ended the quarter up $29 billion from Q1, 2018 on solid flows and a Q1, 2019 market rebound. So, customer activity remained solid across all major product categories. Okay. Turning to the slide 16, note the year-over-year real improvement in consumer banking NII, which drove our 7% growth. As we realized the value of our deposits through our focus on relationship deepening, card income was down 3% year-over-year, driven by higher rewards. Higher rewards were impacted by a number of factors. First, we saw more customers sign up for preferred rewards. Second, as some clients deepen their relationship with us, the amount of their rewards increased. Lastly, we added features that made it easier for customers to earn and view the rewards. While, these types of improvements increased rewards, we believe they also deepen relationships across multiple products, improving retention and profitability. Service charges were 2% lower year-over-year, as we continue to make policy changes to reduce certain overdraft fees for customers. Lower ATM volume also had an impact. Turning to Global Wealth and Investment Management on slide 17, GWIM results were impressive, particularly given the revenue impact of the market\u2019s decline at the end of December. Relative to 2018, the business continued to gain momentum growing net new households, which not only added to solid AUM flows, but also drove another strong quarter of brokerage flows. Net income of just over $1 billion grew 14% from Q1, 2018. Pre-tax margins remain strong at 29%. The business created 360 basis points of year-over-year operating leverage as expense declined 4%, while revenue was down only modestly. Within revenue, positive impacts from the banking activities and AUM flows were not enough to overcome lower market valuations, declines in transactional revenue and general pricing pressures. The expense decline of 4% was driven by lower FDIC insurance costs, lower revenue related to incentive costs and merger related intangibles, which are now fully amortized. Moving to slide 14, Q1 results reflect continued strong client engagement in both -- at both Merrill and the private bank, strong household growth in both businesses and continued low attrition of experienced financial advisors contributed to the $17 billion in overall client flows. On the banking side, deposits were up $20 billion year-over-year, which included inflows of about $8 billion from the conversion of some money market funds to deposits near the end of 2018. We also saw deposit outflows of about $8 billion as the market recovered. Loans are higher by 3% year-over-year, reflecting strong mortgage growth given the decline in rates. We also saw growth in custom lending. Okay. Before discussing Global Banking and Global Markets separately, I know many of you look at these segments together. So for comparison note that on a combined basis, these two segments generated revenue of $9.3 billion and earned $3.1 billion in Q1, which is a 16% return on their combined allocated capital. Looking at them separately and beginning with Global Banking on slide 19, the business earned $2 billion and generated a 20% return on allocated capital. Earnings were up 2% from Q1, 2018, driven by operating leverage. Revenue was up 3% year-over-year, we saw positive impacts from loan and deposit growth, as well as higher interest rates. We also saw higher leasing revenue. These increases more than compensated for a decline in investment banking and loan spread compression. The business created more than 400 basis points of operating leverage, as revenue growth was matched with a 1% decline in expenses. Lower deposit insurance costs more than offset continued investments in technology and bankers. Lastly, provision expense increased year-over-year, driven by the single name charge-off mentioned earlier, as well as the absence of the prior year's energy reserve release. Looking at trends on slide 20, and comparing to Q1 last year, let's focus on IB fees. We and the industry felt the impact of the government shutdown as the SEC was closed for some period of time in the quarter. IB fees of $1.3 billion for the overall firm decreased 7% year-over-year. This was relevant to a global fee pool that is estimated to have declined 14%. Year-over-year, we saw good performance in advisory fees, up 16%. This was more than offset by declined in both debt and equity underwriting fees, within debt underwriting leverage finance rebounded from a tough -- from tough conditions in Q4. But primary additions remained slow and in investment grade we saw lower than expected offerings to finance share repurchases, fee pools in ECM were also down year-over-year. Switching to global markets on slide 21, as I usually do, I will talk about results, excluding DVA. Global Markets produced $1.1 billion of earnings and generate a return on capital of 13%. While Q1 saw a seasonal rebound from Q4, we were down from the first quarter of last year. Q1, 2018 was a record for the equities business fueled by higher client activity and a spike in market volatility. In Q1, 2018, the equity business included a large client derivative -- client driven derivative transaction. Overall, revenue declined 10%, while expenses declined 6%, sales and trading declined 13% year-over-year to $3.6 billion, FICC declined 8%, while equities fell 22%. The decline in equities was more modest, adjusting for the one large client trade in the year ago period. Much lower market volatility this year results in less client activity and weaker performance in equity derivatives. FICC\u2019s lower revenue was due to lower client activity and less favorable markets across both macro and credit related products. Investors remained cautious from the quarter, given geopolitical concerns and market volumes were light for both primary and secondary trading. We had no days with trading losses in the quarter. The year-over-year expense decline was a reflection of lower revenue related costs. On slide 22, you can see that our mix of sales and trading revenue remained weighted to domestic activity where fee pools are concentrated, within FICC we remain more oriented towards credit products than macro. All right, finally, on slide 23. We show all other, which reported a net loss of $48 million, which was relatively unchanged from the prior year period. Given the recent changes to our financial statements that enhanced certain allocation methodologies, we believe the ongoing profitability or loss in this unit should not be much different from Q1, absent unusual items. This quarter, there was the normal seasonal tax benefit associated with stock-based compensation of about $200 million. This moved the tax rate in the quarter from our expected full year rate of 19% to the reported 17% rate in Q1. Okay, with that, let's open it up to questions. Operator : [Operator instructions] We'll take our first question from John McDonald with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead. John McDonald : Hi, good morning. Paul, I was hoping that you cloud clarify the outlook for the net interest income, it sounds like you expect NII to be down sequentially in the second quarter on a few of those pressure points that you mentioned? And then to grow some in the back half as loan and deposit growth and day count get more favorable? Paul Donofrio : Yes, that's right. I mean, as we said in the prepared remarks, we've got some near-term headwinds. Some of them are seasonal; some of them recover long-end rates are down. But as we move to the second half of the year, we expect to benefit from continued loan and deposit growth, plus another day of interest in Q3. So ultimately, we think the full year 2019 NII is going to up roughly 2% year-over-year. By the way, when I gave the -- in the prepared remarks, when I gave the net charge-off with that single credit, I transpose the numbers I said 84 it was really 48. John McDonald : Okay. Just -- and on that outlook for 3% NII in 2019, is that assuming no rate hikes and still a pretty flattish curve. Paul Donofrio : Yes, that assumes the curve as we sit here today, which is flat. John McDonald : Okay, no hikes. Paul Donofrio : Correct. John McDonald : And then in terms of rate sensitivity, you mentioned that that had gone up, how do you think about managing rate sensitivity at this point in the cycle? And actions to potentially protect NII in a flattening curve environment from here or a rate cut scenario from here, how do you think about how sensitive you want to be? Paul Donofrio : Well look, we\u2019re not a hedge fund, we're a bank and so we're customer driven and our asset sensitivity is driven by our loans and our deposits and the activity that our customers do with us. Having said that, we have limits on how much asset sensitivity we want, on the upside and the downside, we're within those limits. There may come a point in the future, where we would do something to modify the asset sensitivity of the company. But, remember when you're doing that you're basically placing a blood on the future rate of -- future change in interest rates, what if you're wrong. So, again, we're a bank, we're serving our customers. That's what creates the asset sensitivity in the company. There may come a time we\u2019ll adjust that, but right now we feel comfortable. John McDonald : Got it. Okay, thanks. Operator : We'll take our next question from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Glenn Schorr : Thanks. Appreciate it. I know it's within the NII construct that you just gave. But I'm curious, you made a comment on in the quarter the non-interest bearing to interest bearing shift in deposits continued, but you thought it would stabilize as rates to it. I'm just looking for some color on how real time is that? In other words, if we get no hikes for this quarter and next quarter, do you think you see an almost immediate stop in that shift? Paul Donofrio : I think, Glenn what I was saying was that the -- you got to look at the -- what drives the value of the consumer deposit franchise in a company and that's a consumer side. And what you're seeing is consumer deposits grew $26 billion and checking grew $24 billion. And so between non-interest and very low interest checking. So that's what drives our account, we have $0.5 million more checking accounts than we did a year ago to give you a sense in a book of $34.5 million went to $35 million. On the non-interest bearing side the reference was in the commercial side, which because the way cash management services are priced when rates rise people have to hold less balances to get the fees, it's credit rate goes up when rate stop rising, which really has happened that stabilizes and we have seen that and expected that to continue. Glenn Schorr : Okay. Maybe that ties into my follow up maybe small, but that the service charges especially at the deposit related fees are down 4% or 5% year-on-year. It seems like a steady trend down is that a customer behavior thing or has Bank of America changed anything on how it charges fees? Paul Donofrio : We continue to think about and continue our change our policies on overdrafts, which has a downward effect on it, but the real driver of that is the fact that we have primary households. So the people are above the limits of free checking for lack of better term and if you get $250 a month in direct deposit then you can get free accounts free those fees are waived if you have $1,500 average balances et cetera, et cetera. And so, the profitability of consumer franchise is a combined profitability of the deposit value and the fee value. And together you saw that revenue growth of 7% year-over-year. So, it is not -- we price on a relationship basis. So you have to be careful to look at this thing in parts. Glenn Schorr : Understood. Thank you. Appreciate it. Operator : We'll take our next question from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Steven Chubak : Hi, good morning. Wanted to ask a question about some of the remarks in the context of an operating leverage line. So a core tenant of the investment case has been your ability to deliver sustained positive operating leverage. I think slide three actually showcases that quite well. Just given the current outlook for loan and deposit growth and expectations for expenses to increase year-on-year at least for the remainder of 2019 are you still confident given the NII guidance and your ability to continue that momentum and deliver positive operating leverage even in the absence of higher rates? Paul Donofrio : Yes, I mean, look the way I would think about it we've given you guidance on expenses. We've told you that in 2019 and 2020 we expect that our expenses will be approximately what they were for full year 2018 on an adjusted basis. And so we're going to create operating leverage if we grow loans and grow deposits and grow revenue. It's simple as that if we're holding expenses flat. Steven Chubak : Okay, fair enough. And just one follow up for me on TLAC. Paul, since you gave some incremental color this quarter, I think I asked it on the last call. But I was wondering if you could provide some more details, since you noted more explicitly that you're operating comfortably above the required levels. Given the much higher interest expense associated with long-term debt, I was hoping you could actually size that excess TLAC cushion. And whether there's any appetite to optimize your TLAC ratios to maybe help reduce that interest expense burden, especially given the tougher operating rate backdrop that we're currently operating in. Paul Donofrio : Sure, there's obviously appetite in interest and optimizing. We'll be disclosing in the Q, a lot of detail around the TLAC -- the different TLAC ratios. I guess, a couple of things, as you see those. Remember, we received approval of $2.5 billion of additional buybacks in February. We've also been setting up a new bank entity and a new broker dealer for Brexit, plus, we're creating a new broker dealer as part of resolution planning. So, our funding needs are a little bit elevated right now. We need to optimize that over the long-term. And, we'll sort all that out. Steven Chubak : All right, that's it for me. Thanks very much. Operator : And our next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Good morning. Paul, can you give us some more color, if I heard you correctly, you mentioned that the equity business included a very large derivative client driven transaction. Can you give us some more color on what that was? Paul Donofrio : I'm not sure I would give you more color on the specifics of the relationship or the client. We don't like to comment on individual clients. But look it impacted, I think if you backed it out, equities would have been down how much 13% -- 12% instead of the 22%. So it was a meaningful transaction last year. Gerard Cassidy : Okay. And then second, you guys have done an obviously very good job in holding the line on expenses. Can you give us some color on where you think the efficiency ratio could eventually get to and you can operate consistently at that level? Brian Moynihan : Well, Gerard, I think it just -- as we said it continues to drift down where it stops, we don't ever try to give people a number for fear they'll stop there and not keep pushing. And so our job is to continue to drive it down. So with flat expenses in a rising NII that like Paul described. You're going to see -- that all just obviously falls to the bottom-line. But remember the NII component this is really very marginal from standpoint of happening and checking accounts on $35 million a consumer $20 billion more investment assets to Merrill Edge. The wealth management business grows on a very leveraged platform. So if you look across the efficiency ratio, or the pre-tax margin, wealth management 29% efficiency ratios, they\u2019ll continue to get better, all in that will help in a quarter where markets are up, you'll see that number drop down quickly in the quarter where market activity is less which year-over-year the market activity was less than last year. So we saw a little deterioration that side even though we made 250 basis points of improvement overall. So I don't -- if I say to you guys on this call my team will say we've made a goal so the goal is to continue to drive it. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good morning. Couple of questions, just on the expense question one more for 1Q. You came in with an extremely low expense ratio this quarter, do you see that more as a one-off due to the fact that the revenues were a little lighter in the capital markets for the reasons you mentioned earlier? Or is this a good number that, as we look forward year-on-year to 1Q, 2020, you could improve on? Brian Moynihan : Well, again, let me just take one step back. We've given our perspective on what we think 2019 and 2020 is going to be we said, with all the investments we're doing the increase in technology, the merit, health care, everything we're doing. Adding bankers, adding financial centers, we think because of digitization, because of all the efficiency. We think we can hold expenses at that 2018 level. So that's how I would think about it. If you just think about Q1 expenses, they were up, approximately $150 million from Q4. Q1 obviously included the normal $400 million-ish of seasonality of elevated payroll expenses. This was sort of partially offset by the timing of some tech initiative spend and marketing costs, which combined were kind of down about $200 million quarter-over-quarter. But we expect both of those to be up for the full year of 2018 as we continue to invest. We mentioned in the prepared remarks the deferred comp issue, which had a quarter-over-quarter effect. We mentioned the Merrill Lynch intangibles, which was about $75 million. But having said all that for the year is what I would focus on, we think we're going to be at $53 billion in change. Betsy Graseck : Okay, that's helpful. And then can you speak a little bit to the loan growth side, because we got the NII overall and understand the NIM trajectory here. But can you just give us a sense as to what's in your outlook there for loan growth. And if there's any variance between the different buckets, that'd be helpful too? Brian Moynihan : I think, Betsy just to give you -- look for our company and for U.S. economy, especially where we saw some relatively strong performance was in our middle market business this quarter and our small business. In those -- that's good, because that means the core tens of thousands of customers in the middle market and the millions of small businesses are using their lines and line users went up by a percent middle market, small business, so I think originations were up 7%, 8% year-over-year in the quarter. So I think the -- if you think about the thing overall, either, that's good news. And so as we think about it long-term the run-off, if you go back to that page and look at the non-core portfolio, it's gotten to a point now where it's small enough, the impact is muted. So the 1% overall growth and 5% core growth we'd say the 5% core growth is in line with our expectations. The 1% overall ought to frankly start to mitigate, because that number of non-core loans is really just down to a much smaller number. And frankly, we sold -- this quarter we sold off some of the toughest loans just to kind of get ourselves position in case no matter what happens next. So expect us to do see the core loan growth in that mid-single-digits and expect maybe a little bit more of it to come through the bottom line as the non-core runs off. That's just a follow up on your question to Paul on expenses. We are driving the company hard to continue to reengineered on a constant consistent basis. So the digitization that you saw in the consumer business which we talked a lot about is swinging through the commercial businesses fairly consistently. And the cash pro product the cash pro mobile product and things like that are growing. And so there was a very digitized business from sending a cash is a little different to consumer, but the activity between us and the customer, the paper to electronic, any one form of electronic to another form of electronic frankly, saves us expenses but also put some pressure on revenues even though the treasury services revenues you can see are up nicely. So, expect that we're going to do everything we can on expenses, we're going to make the investments of $3 billion in technology. We're going to continue to drive the physical plant rejuvenation and continue to add people because it's working. But don't ever think that we're trying to -- we're not overspending here we're going to spend what we need to do to drive this company forward. Betsy Graseck : Got it. Yes, I mean at one point you mentioned something like $5 billion spent annually on storing and moving cash in check. Is that, still kind of the lag line for that? Brian Moynihan : We\u2019re chipping the weight is still high. Even, check deposits continue to go down in our franchisee year-over-year. In the first quarter, they went from about $145 million in last year first quarter, $125 million to $130 million -- $127 million I think it was this quarter. But if you look at it the -- and just that change the mobile deposits were up 15 million units in a single quarter where the financial center are down -- the mobile were up 1 million units in a single quarter where the financial centers are down about 1.5 million units, 1.25 million unit. So each year, we're driving that incremental change. So that's just checks deposit, that's not even cash distributed and stuff. So just that it is a big cost a lot of it's on a commercial side too. And we continue to drive it down. Collecting all that core in currency for the small businesses and people and that collect cash as part of their operations we continue to digitize that, too. Betsy Graseck : Okay, that's great. And just one last question for me, I know you've been planning on increasing hiring in the investment bank, especially around the middle market. And I'm wondering, do you feel that you are fully baked there with your head count? Or is there still some more room to ramp that and thinking about what the impact is going to be on the loan growth as you indicated earlier? Brian Moynihan : So if you look at it, think about this time last year and into the summer, we continue to look at our position we've been adding people, we still have room to go to add. It's all in the numbers you see. So as expensive came down we added more people in that area in both middle market bankers filling out the franchise in various areas, and investment bankers dedicated to that area. The team's has been building up, and then frankly rounding out our general teams in investment banking. And so, Matthew Carter [ph] came in and picked it up. We're seeing market share sort of improvements even in markets which are not as robust as we like, from our standpoint. Then -- but we expect that the middle market one has been growing very fast it is a matter of just getting more capacity. If you look at some of those numbers are up 25% in fees over the last couple years, we just got to keep driving. Paul Donofrio : And just to give you a sense on progress, if you look at hiring year-to-date versus last year in investment banking and capital markets commercial bankers. It's that 3 times of the pace as it was last year and attrition is down. So we're definitely making progress. Betsy Graseck : Okay, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Saul Martinez with UBS. Please go ahead. Saul Martinez : Hey, good morning guys. On the interest rate sensitivity, you gave the reasons for why the sensitivity moved up long-end rates and deposit assumptions, but at a point in time, what is the breakout of the $3.7 billion between short and long-end right now? Sorry if I missed that you broke it out. Paul Donofrio : Yes, 75% on the short end, 25% on the long end. Saul Martinez : 75-25 still, okay. Also, you've been under -- so you've had some pressure obviously with higher short-end rates on the sales and trading NII. I assume your 3% growth, does that assume some easing of pressure as rates stabilize here? Paul Donofrio : Well, as rate stabilize we shouldn't see much change in NII in that business. Saul Martinez : Okay. So it's assuming no rebound because as assets reprice and funding costs remain stable. Paul Donofrio : That's right. Brian Moynihan : That stuff moves pretty quick through the system. But it -- the 3% it includes that part of the balance. Paul Donofrio : There just isn't a lot of asset sensitivity in global markets. Saul Martinez : Okay, fair enough. Just to change gears, on cards, income was down 2% year-on-year, volumes were up only 2% year-on-year. Can you just give a little bit of color, what's going on there? Paul Donofrio : Yes, sure. Look, the first thing I would say is, again, Brian said it, but remember we're focused not on products, but on increasing and deepening relationships and remember consumers revenue was up 7% year-over-year and profits were up 25%. To your question, purchase volume growth has slowed, but it was still up 2% year-over-year. We've got higher rewards also pressuring revenue. But again, higher rewards are also driving higher deposit balances, which help NII as well as client retention. We continue to add more than a million new cards each quarter although this is down moderately as we focus on profitability and reevaluate applications that are looking to play the rewards game. Saul Martinez : Okay, got it. Then just one final thing, CECL, if you can just give us an update where you were in the process and how you're thinking about when you'll give us the day one impact? Paul Donofrio : Sure. So we've made a lot of progress and our efforts are continuing, we did a parallel run in Q1, which we\u2019re still analyzing, but based upon the early estimates from that parallel run we do expect CECL reserves to increase. I think it's important to point out, there's still a lot more work to do.But we would currently estimate the impact to be an increase in our reserves of up to 20%. I want to emphasize that sort of any adjustment to reserves will be based upon the composition of our portfolio and the forecast of economic conditions at that time, which is going to be year-end. In addition, we haven't finalized their methodologies. And look, if you're thinking about drivers, it's obviously credit card is the primary driver. Relative to others, you got to look at commercial real estate, those are the things that are affecting reserves. Saul Martinez : Got it, that's really helpful. Thank you. Paul Donofrio : Just so that equates to that 20%, that up to 20% equates to a reserve increase of about $2 billion. Saul Martinez : Got it. It's not material for your capital. I get it. Okay. Paul Donofrio : Yes. And from a capital perspective, it's going to get phased in over three years. Saul Martinez : Yes. Understood. Operator : And our next question from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Matthew O\u2019Connor: Good morning. Any thoughts on the NIM percent going forward, obviously, there could be some quarter-to-quarter volatility, but just as we think about the underlying direction in NIM, can you hold it stable or might it bleed down a little bit? Paul Donofrio : Look, longer term I think NIM is going to depend on the forward curve. I mean, that's the best answer I can give you. In Q2, I guess I would expect, NIM to decline a little bit because of all the items I mentioned earlier, in those prepared remarks. It's up year-over-year nicely. I think if you look at the banking book, you can really see the power it's up to sort of 3.03%, which is up 10 basis points year-over-year. Matthew O\u2019Connor: Okay. And then if we just take the forward curve, which is what\u2019s in your net interest income dollar guidance, would that imply some underlying pressure beyond 2Q as well? Paul Donofrio : No, I think again, I think it's going to be -- it would apply flat I think is what I would say. Matthew O\u2019Connor: Okay. And then just \u2026 Paul Donofrio : Over the whole year. Matthew O\u2019Connor: So what do you mean by that, so down a little bit in 2Q and then up a little bit in back half of the year to get back to 1Q. Paul Donofrio : That's right. Matthew O\u2019Connor: Okay. And then just bigger picture question, obviously, not just a concern for Bank of America, but as we think about exiting this year, and we just take everything at face value that rates stay here and all these other assumptions, they'll probably change but let's just hold all that and it does seem like revenue growth is going to flatten out as we get into 2020. And I'm just wondering like What you're thinking in terms of levers that can be pulled? You had a lot of discussion around expenses. Are there new products or customer segments that you can go after? Essentially other revenue opportunities that you can control independent of the macro, if the expenses are kind of lined up and flatten there's not too much more to do there. Brian Moynihan : I think if you think about a growth rate in economy of two percentage points or so, and you think back about the last decade, we've been at that level more than we\u2019ve been at any other level. And what did we do we grew loans mid-single digit, we grew deposits 3%, 4%, 5% faster, now kind of growing at that rate. That adds basically very advantaged cost of funds and loans that are well priced to our core clients in both the consumer and commercial side. And that then grows the net interest margin a lot of talk about over the last few years about what was the contribution rates, half of it came more or less than rates and half of it came from hard work and we expect the half that came from hard work to keep coming. And that leverage in the platform with expenses being flat is pretty good leverage. And then the markets, will be what they are but as I said earlier, remember that the revenue from those two activities year-over-year is up 7%. Paul gave you the NII view of that. The fees side of that revenue was down deeply, but even with what's happened during the quarter to think about the wealth management business from the way the particular prices off in December, into January and things like that, think about the recovery either the fee income even it stays flat from here, it will be substantial in wealth management business. So we feel good just driving out more customer relationships and more loans and deposits and more wealth management business from them. And that will give us a pre-tax -- ability to grow pretax in the mid to upper single digits. And then the share count through their capital management. So that's the model of the 2% growth economy. If you tell me, you're predicting a recession, we\u2019d handle the company differently as what everybody else, but that's not what we think. And then, as I think about it overall, just this is a great franchise and we're just grinding out the growth that's embedded in it. And that will produce as we've said mid-single digit, mid-upper single digit operating earnings increase, combined with share account will get you in double digits, and that's pretty good. Matthew O\u2019Connor: Okay, all right. That was clear. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Nancy Bush with NAB Research. Please go ahead. Nancy Bush : Good morning. Brian, this is a question about your program to lift the minimum wage from $15 to $20 over the next 20 months. And I can see how this is necessary, as you said to quote get the best people in an economy that has the unemployment rates that we do right now. But can you just kind of generally flush out what kind of productivity improvements you're seeing in the workforce, and whether this $5 raise will be paid for by productivity. Brian Moynihan : Yes, it's going to be -- well it has been I think, in the last several years, we've gone from probably sub $10 an hour to over $15. And it's been paid for every year. So I think our ability to continue to drive productivity is really driven by the change in customer behavior and the digital capabilities we have. So more of the activity that would have been done a decade ago or two decades ago, person handing a check for deposit to branches would have through a person's hands and now goes through a mobile bank deposit, mobile check deposits, and the cost of that is 10 fold different. And yet, we still have in this quarter alone $50 million odd deposits at the financial centers to work on. So the productivity will increase, we've been able to pay for those kinds of increases, we've been able to keep the healthcare costs for the lower compensated teammates flat since 2011, after we cut it in half. And this is all to really have great teammates working with our core customer base. And that's what we are focused on. And our average compensation of our company is $120,000 or something like that. So this is not -- this is to really help drive in the branch and the call centers and the operations groups to continued efficiency. But overall, we continue to manage head count down to make it happen. Nancy Bush : Okay. Also have a quick question about the credit cycle. Marianne Lake [ph] said on Friday that I think there were sort of 5 loans that came on non-accrual -- 5 material loans that came on non-accrual at JPMorgan Chase. And that was the second quarter that that had happened. And she characterized these credits as idiosyncratic, not belonging to any particular industry, et cetera. I guess my question is this, has the nature of credit cycles really changed due to the low rate environment? And how will you know, if we are entering a new credit cycle? Brian Moynihan : We continue to -- those are great questions, Nancy, when you think about it in a broader context. But I think the major differences with our company is that the geographic distribution in the United States means that we're not susceptible to any regional issues dominating our discussion, as it would have been 20, 30 years ago, or even a decade plus ago. I think that the balance in the company from a consumer and commercial has come down -- has changed substantially, so we're 50%, 50%. I think the secured portion of consumer is the dominant part as opposed to going in the last crisis. So all that sort of gives us a different feel for what we think the credit cycle be like. When you go to the commercial side, the underwriting capabilities of the team have been proven through cycles as being very strong. The ratings integrity is strong, when we go through with all the reviews whether it's SNC [ph] or whether it's internal reviews. And so yes, a company like the charge-off we had in the fourth quarter can have an idiosyncratic event that causes some damage. But will it be wholly different, it will really depend if the economy stays bumping along it goes into slight degradation, you're going to see some across the board distress. But I think so far as we've seen pieces pop-up oil and gas a few years ago. We put up reserves, we took most of them back in. The retailing business, we were a major lender in it we've been able to work through the credits there because the nature of the collateral and stuff like that that has consumer side, the charge-off rate stays low. We've worked through, as you know a lot of mortgage credit that was just still with us and we've been getting that down and that's brought our charge-off some mortgage back to where we thought they'd be. So I'm not sure, I would ever say you have to take any credits that happen and say there's no -- you have to say it's completely isolated one-off events, because you got to be careful not to fool yourself. But on the other hand, what we see is right now the fundamentals of the economy in the U.S. on a global basis and the fundamentals of consumers and unemployment being low as you mentioned, means that credit is in good shape and we just don't see that changing a lot. Nancy Bush : Thanks. Paul Donofrio : I just want to add one thing; I know you're asking how will we know? But the one thing, I do want to stress is how much we've transformed the company over the last 10 years by sticking to responsible growth by changing the mix between consumer and commercial by focusing on prime and super priming. And again, the best place to see that is in the Fed stress test results, where you can see that our loss rate over multiple years and we'll see what it is this year has been lower than all peers. And almost 50% lower than the worst nine quarters we experienced during the financial crisis. So the company is just fundamentally different. Nancy Bush : Okay, all right. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Alevizos Alevizakos with HSBC. Please go ahead. Alevizos Alevizakos : Hi. Thank you for taking my question. You have already mentioned about GWIM, but it was a really impressive performance. When I'm looking at the numbers, clearly, the outperformance except for the solid revenues, just coming from the expense line and you mentioned a couple of factors during your prepared remarks, including the FDIC and the lower intangible amortization costs. I was wondering, as a first question, whether you would be able to quantify like what was the lower expense coming from the intangible amortization cost and then from FDIC, especially in that division? Paul Donofrio : So those lower intangible is about $75 million per quarter. And FDIC, I think is a little over $100 million per quarter, for the whole company. Yes. Alevizos Alevizakos : So not only for the wealth management just for generally all the company? Paul Donofrio : Yes, and that's -- Merrill intangibles is $75 million. FDIC for the whole company is sort of like $150-ish million. Alevizos Alevizakos : Okay. Paul Donofrio : So Merrill is going to be half of that. So you obviously don't get the whole thing. Alevizos Alevizakos : Yes. And as a second question, I think I missed you at the end when you were talking about the all other segment. You guided basically that the Q1 is actually a good indicator for the future, but you also mentioned that there was this tax benefit of $200 million. So what is actually the run rate? Is it the $50 million loss or the $250 million? Paul Donofrio : Yes. There was a sort of normal seasonal kind of tax variability that I expect most people had in their models. So if you adjust for that a good for modeling purpose I would suggest to use around a loss of around $200 million per quarter. That's a good base. Alevizos Alevizakos : Okay, thank you very much. Operator : Our next question is from Vivek Juneja with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Vivek Juneja : Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Couple of questions, I hear you on the card purchase volumes and the rewards expense. Your card outstanding growth has also slowed substantially, it's gone from up 5% year-on-year last year in the first quarter, then it was in the 4-ish percent over the course of the year and it was flat year-on-year in this quarter. Can you talk about -- I heard you say that you're trying to avoid customers who are gaining the rewards side. What about the card outstanding growth why has that slowed so much? Paul Donofrio : In term of Card balances. Vivek Juneja : Yes, card balances, Paul, that slow to flat year-on-year. And if you look over the course of the last five quarters that's a slowdown from where you've been coming over the last year. Paul Donofrio : Yes, look I would expect low-single digit year-over-year growth to sort of continue. Right now we are experiencing a little bit of an uptick in the portfolio payment rate that's affecting growth. Vivek Juneja : Okay. And that's just you think just temporary that what's driving that that it would only be temporary? Paul Donofrio : Look, I just think it's good economy, and we have high quality customers in our card portfolio and they're taking some of their excess deposits and paying off the balances. Vivek Juneja : Okay. Shifting gears, Brian, a question for you in western banking. If I look at your -- I hear you on the fact that you've been hiring more bankers, Paul, mentioned that too. When I look at your IB fees this quarter at least based on the results you have better come out thus far, it seems like you've slipped now to number five. Any color on why, you used to be number two few years ago and it's gone, -- it slipped further and further. Is it a risk issue, is it an expense issue? What is the issue and what should we expect as we look out, Brian? Brian Moynihan : I guess, we'll end up four or five on fees paid depending on what is going on at the time. It will ebb or flow. If it's more that capital markets driven, typically we do better if it's more equity capital markets we do a little bit differently and if it's advisory, we sort of depends on sort of what the deals are. At the end of day, if the team continue to work on driving it, we feel good if the progress is being made and we\u2019ll continue to make that progress in the future. But I always tell people to keep in mind, the Global Banking segment in our company are $2 billion $700 million of which was investment banking fees. So the key for serving corporate clients is to have a full robust broad relationship and drive the cash management and drive the lending and the investment banking and not get overly focused on 2% of our revenue. Vivek Juneja : Thanks. Operator : And we\u2019ll take today's last question from Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead. Brian Kleinhanzl : Yes, thanks. So, one quick question on the commercial, I guess, that is still kind of construct upon commercial growth. But can you point anything specifically that you're actually seeing an improvement on the commercial side is like line utilization up year-on-year, are you seeing more CapEx spending? Brian Moynihan : There has been a lot of talk. If you think about the last couple years of the economy and the last year and half in economy and commercial loan growth and I don't get the fantods all over that and that the sense it\u2019s things ebb and flow by what's going on. And so I think what you saw this quarter really a combination of probably three things for us in the core commercial business, commercial loans across the board. One is, in terms of the business banking segment, which is a smaller end we've hit sort of an inflection point we were managing some of the credit risk in that portfolio. That\u2019s kind of hit the base and that's a smaller book, but it does impact year-over-year that was down like over $1 billion and that's now flattened out in terms of linked quarter impact. Second thing as the small business continues to grow it does a good job in that and you can see that separately. But the third most important thing is, we deployed more middle market bankers, they continue to deepen relationships and as we did it, we basically not only did we took down the number of accounts per person, so that they could deepen the relationship to spend the time that's why we've seen the treasury service and other revenue grow. But importantly also even pushing harder on the loan growth side, and that benefit us. And then, frankly, for years we were kind of running down a little bit of our commercial real estate on a relative basis, you would have seen other people grow faster as the market settled in and we like the credit risk better, we've actually seen a little better growth in the commercial real estate segment very high and very strong quality that's helped us a little bit too. And then the last thing, which I think is good news to the economy overall is the line usage went up about a point in middle market which is -- which means that, that's across a lot of lines obviously, but what that really means is that people are using the credit\u2019s the right word. So there are task of driving commercial loan growth is really down to literally thousands of people out there every day doing the job that Matthew and Alistair [ph] and Acer and Sharon Miller [ph] and the team push them to do and we're seeing the benefits of that. And that ought to be compounding in the future. Brian Kleinhanzl : And then just a separate question on the card income,. I know it has been asked a couple of different ways, but typically there is some seasonality in the first quarter. Was the seasonality impact greater than the rewards impact in that linked quarter decline in card income and consumer banking. Brian Moynihan : The impact of -- if charges were up and fees were down, obviously impacted the rewards credits and other credits both the merchant and everything else exceeded the growth in the revenue. And so I think that's given. So we were up 3% in charge volume, something like that and then overall declined slightly. You remember that we're running our credit card relationship management business different than a lot of people. We run it as an integrated business. And so when you see that $26 billion in deposits growth in consumer remember a lot of it's coming in large deposit relationships in the context of general consumers and not wealth, affluent wealth management people to customers. It's coming because they're bringing to us $10,000 or $20,000 in balances to that is helping drive our deposit balances and a relationship size in order to get the reward system. And so when you look at that you got to be careful about looking any one line item that we have and look at it in total growth and that's a 7% consumer overall and the risk adjusted margin on the card product, I think we show is over 8%. So it's very high credit quality and the fees included in that. So, I think it's one of the differences, we're going to look a little different. And so, yes, the amount we rewarded our customers to do business with us, exceeded the rate of growth than their charge a little bit, but combined with their deposit balances and how they get the rewards. You saw a consumer deposit level growth of mid-single digits, you saw $26 billion which is the size of a good bank right there, just in consumer. And it was all in check, the total other growth other than checking was like $2 billion. So it's all checking growth and all really what we do for people in the card as part of that payments, debit card, credit card and checking are really linked accounts now. Brian Kleinhanzl : Good, thanks. Brian Moynihan : All right. Well, thank you for joining us again, we appreciate your interest, another quarter record earnings, strong client activity we continue to see a good strong, solid U.S. economy. We deepen those relationships, we had strong asset quality. And again, at the end of day, we delivered a 16% return on tangible common equity, 126 basis points return on assets. And we did that by driving operating leverage of 400 basis points. So thank you look forward to talk to you next quarter. Operator : And this will conclude today's program. Thanks for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, everyone and welcome to the today's Bank of America Second Quarter Earnings Announcement Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, you will have the opportunity to ask questions during the question-and-answer session. Please note this call is being recorded. I will be standing by should you need any assistance.It is now my pleasure to turn today\u2019s conference over to Lee McEntire. Please go ahead. Lee McEntire : Good morning. Thanks for joining this morning's call for a discussion of our 2Q 2019 results. I trust everybody has had a chance to review the earnings release documents which were available on the Investor Relations section of the bankofamerica.com website.Before I turn the call over to our CEO, Brian Moynihan, let me remind you that we may make forward-looking statements during this call. After Brian's comments, our CFO, Paul Donofrio, will review the details of our second quarter results. We'll then open up for questions. For further information on any forward-looking statements, please refer to either our earnings release documents, our website, or our SEC filings.With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to you Brian. Brian Moynihan : Yes, thanks Lee and good morning everyone and thank you for joining us to review our second quarter results. Many of you discussed, written about and engaged in debate about the perceived change and the forward environment that we all saw this quarter. However, we saw in our client base during the second quarter 2019 with solid consumer activity pointing to a continued growing economy in the United States this year albeit at a slower pace.In that environment our company reported the best earnings quarter in the company\u2019s history. That was made possible through the hard work of my 209,000 team-mates who are driving responsible growth. We reported $7.3 billion in after tax net income and $0.74 per share. Both these items increased on a linked quarter and a year-over-year basis.Revenue on an FTE basis was $23.2 billion and grew 2%. We increased our return on assets to 123 basis points. Our return on tangible common equity was 16.2% And in the end, responsible growth continued to prove strong earnings, returns and shareholder value.As we look at Slide 3, we start to highlight how we achieve these results. Revenue grew 2% and expenses were basically flat year-over-year. We generate operating leverage of more than 200 basis points; our credit costs remained low and stable, so that resulted in year-over-year net income growing 8%, and during the past year we bought back 7% of our shares, this reflects the model of combining solid operations with strong capital returns and then thereby driving strong core EPS growth.This quarter, diluted EPS grew 17% from the second quarter of 2018. All the way along, our capital and liquidity positions are very strong and continue to strengthen. Book value per share grew 10%. We also had important client growth and market share gains in our businesses.Client activity showed $75 billion of deposit growth, a growth rate of 6% year-over-year. We also had $37 billion of that deposit growth came from people, consumers. At the same time we saw a strong investment flows from those customers.Loans in our businesses grew $34 billion or 4%. Importantly, we saw progress in other focus areas as well. A year ago, I told you we\u2019d continue to drive to regain our position in investment banking, as a nice start we saw market shares across many of the products, and investment bank in the first half of this year. One example is IPOs we're number one in volume for U.S. IPOs in the first half. [Matthew Koder] [ph] and the team have done a good job and off to a good start driving this business.All in, we're pleased with the results this quarter. We grew. We did it the right way. We stayed with our risk parameters, and we continue to invest heavily in our franchise -- franchise adding salespeople, more technology, increasing our marketing spend and improving and expanding our physical plant in all dimensions.This results also led to the highest first half earnings in the company's history. So as we look at Slide four, we show you the last five years results of the first half. For the first half of 2019, we generated nearly $15 billion in after tax earnings. Compared to the first half of 2018, EPS was up 16% and you can see that growth has continued for the last five years.In those years we have driven operating leverage. You can see that in the lower right. This year we saw that operating leverage continue in the first half. This led to a 57% efficiency ratio. We use the excess capital beyond the need for growth and investments in our company to buy back shares, a trend which has accelerated and you can see on the lower left here.Now primary goal of driving responsible growth has been to produce sustainable results even if the environment changes. This requires us to drive operational excellence in all we do, so that we can drive operating leverage. And we did it again this quarter.As you move to Slide 5, you can see our -- we've extended our positive operating leverage streak to 18 consecutive quarters. In those 18 quarters, you've seen many different market environments; changes in interest rates, economic growth has sped up or slowed down, but we still manage to drive operating leverage for four and a half years and successively.Generating operating leverage doesn't get any easier after four plus years. However, with that strong expense discipline, we remain focused upon it. Now one of the things that you don't see here and you see in our results is the improvement we're starting to see in some of the categories especially consumer fees as you go through the quarters the last four quarters.Over the last decade, we faced service charge headwinds and consumer from reductions in accounts, and in other fees related accounts for many years. This was based on our consumer strategy to strive to have the best-in-class franchise, were lower fees because of the changes in overdraft policies, but also most importantly the drive we've had towards being the core relationship bank for an American consumer.Now in the recent past, from offsetting those [rate][ph] fee reductions by increasing the growth in the actual accounts, the number of accounts we have that are primary household relationships the past last few years, we have much higher retention than we've ever had and we're improving client satisfaction to levels that hasn't been seen before.But most importantly, that focus and relationship depth has resulted in 92% of our households with primary with an average balance of $7000 plus. In card income, we are seeing the consumer debit and credit card spending at a 5% plus level year-over-year. This seems consistent with us to a 2% plus growth U.S. GDP environment. We\u2019re still -- fighting the headwinds of the reward impacts that go on in that business and you see that in us and our competitors, but in the end of the day, we are providing great value for consumers. In the end of the day, when you look at the total relationship and those consumers, it's great economics to our shareholders.Now next couple of slides we're going to do something we\u2019ve done in each of the earnings reports for some time, but we're going to add a piece to it. We always have talked to you about our consumer business -- banking digital usage which you can see on Slide 6. But importantly on Slide 7, we'll talk about how that impact is now being driven across our corporate and global transaction services business.So first let's start on Slide 6 with our consumers. Each quarter, we've shown you these charts. In the second quarter, in its broadest context we had 2.4 billion interactions in the second quarter alone with our consumers across all our channels. To show you how dominated it is by digital, 2.3 billion of those interactions were digitally or automated base. This explains why we have to be, and are excellent both high touch and high tech. If you looked at our digital only clients, meaning customers have not used a financial center in the past year, we have 30 million consumer customers across our platform who are primarily digital, who have more than $400 billion and balances with us today. Their entire relationship is managed digitally and the balance and activity continues to grow strongly. But, that's not our business. Our customers want both, physical and digital access. This is why we continue to invest heavily enhancing our number one ranked digital platform, while at the same time enhancing our best-in-class financial centers.And again this quarter, you see the interaction of those two in the lower left hand side of the slide with a record number of appointments that were set up. 580,000 times a person took their mobile digital device, set up an appointment to come into a branch in the quarter, and you can see that on the lower left.To better serve the three quarters of million customers that come into our centers every day. This quarter we added another 17 financial centers to help drive the growth in our consumer business. We then renovated 45 more, bringing over 1200 that we've renovated in the last few years, and we remain on track to not only hit the three year targets we established 18 months ago of adding 500 new financial centers, and the targets we established to renovate over 3000.We also are adding many more relation managers in these new centers and refreshed a lot of centers to bring them up to our modern high touch environment. Now one of the things that we hear a lot about is the millennial customer and the Gen Z customer. Our digital capabilities are one of the things that attract millennials to our platform. Today, in our customer base, we estimate that we have 16 million millennial customers. Those are customers between the ages of 25 and 41. These millennials are very important for our growth, and they hold nearly $200 billion in deposit investments with us. It's a powerful platform to all segments of the U.S. consumer population.Now turning to Slide 7. Well many of us focus on the consumer digital trends. I think it's also important to recognize a significant activity of the digital transformation in our commercial space. Over the past decade, we've been investing continuously in our global transaction services platform and on Slide 7 we start to show the digital capabilities as part of that investment.We focus on making the business easier, faster, cheaper and more secure for clients and make it more convenient to access and be in business 24 by 7. We now have nearly 500,000 cash PRO Online users with double digit growth in mobile usage attached to that. Mobile payment approvals by these users were 123 billion in the past year, doubling year-over-year and it's growing very fast obviously. One of the latest enhancements, the type of thing that shows innovation we have is to have mobile tokens delivered through an Apple Watch to help corporate treasurer\u2019s process payments. And at the end of the day the people who work with our companies, in our companies, want the same convenience that our consumers want to be able to deliver the services.So let me end up here by addressing a few questions which are on your mind. Number one, many of you asked, what -- what we see if the expected forward yield curve comes true, i.e. the reduction in interest rates is in the curve. I asked Paul to lay out our thoughts on that and he'll do that shortly.The second question is can you -- strong asset quality continue to last? Assuming the economic conditions continue to move along, we think the net charge-offs should remain low for some time and we've told you that for many quarters in a row. This is not because something we're doing in the second quarter of 2019, it's because the work we've done over the last decade to continue to maintain our risk profile on a consistent basis and drive towards it. We see no immediate credit concerns as evidenced by the volume or additions in non-performing loans or delinquencies or any of the statistics around credit that you can see it in the documents.The third question is, okay, given an environment where you may see a slowdown in economy do you have further expense levers to pull? Well one of the questions we get is because we manage expenses so well, is there more of things you can do? We believe that it's important to continue to invest in the future of franchise. Paul is going to talk to you about near-term expense guidance a little later, but importantly, the reason why you're investing is to produce these investments presumably meaning result -- meaningful results.But our 2019 expenses are projected to be lower than 2018. And that brings us to every year in the last decade we've had declining expenses except for one. But we as managers you want us to be, agree with you that if there's severe economic issues ahead, we have the flexibility to continue to reshape this expense base, obviously starting with revenue related costs, which would adjust quickly and automatically and then changing our investment strategies.I considered these areas we focus on and are on our minds just as they are on your mind. So with that, let me turn it over to Paul for a few more details on the quarter. Paul? Paul Donofrio : Good morning, everyone. I'm going to start on Slide eight since Brian already covered the P&L. Overall, compared to the end of Q1, the balance sheet grew $19 billion driven by loan growth, which ended the quarter more than $20 billion higher in our business segments.Liquidity strengthened in the quarter, global -- average global liquidity sources of 552 billion remained well above requirements. Shareholders' equity increased $4.4 billion as we issued $2.4 billion in preferred stock ahead of planned calls announced in July, and common equity increased 2 billion, versus Q1, the $2 billion dollar increase in common equity reflects an increase in AOCI as the value of our AFS debt securities rose given the decline in loan and interest rates.In total, we returned $7.9 billion in Q2 through common dividends and share repurchases, 112% of net income available to common. As a reminder, we recently announced plans for a 20% increase in our quarterly dividend, as well as an increase in our share repurchases to more than $30 billion over the next four quarters.With respect to regulatory metrics, our key lock ratios remain comfortably above our minimum requirements. Our CET1 standardized ratio increased to 11.7% remaining well above our minimum requirement of 9.5%, higher capital levels drove the increased AOCI excuse me higher capital levels were driven by the increased AOCI, improved the CET1 ratio while higher loan balances and commitments mitigated some of that improvement.Moving to client activity and starting with average deposits on Slide nine, average deposits grew nearly $75 billion or 6% year-over-year. This was the 15th consecutive quarter in which we grew deposits more than $40 billion.Global banking alone brought in more than $39 billion. Global Banking continued to benefit from strong customer demand, reflecting the additional bankers we have deployed over the last few years in the middle market franchise. We also continue to see a shift from non-interest bearing to interest bearing deposits in global banking.Deposits with consumers grew $37 billion or 4%. Within that, Global Wealth Management was up $18 billion year-over-year reflecting client growth with a preference to hold cash amid market uncertainty as well as inflows of about $8 billion from the conversion of some money market funds to deposits near the end of 2018.Consumer banking deposits grew by $19 billion or 3% year-over-year. More importantly, checking balances grew while more expensive balances declined modestly. In fact, checking balances grew $22 billion or 6% year-over-year to $374 billion while rate paid remained low at 9 basis points, up only 5 basis points year-over-year.Turning to average loans on Slide 10, overall our loans grew a little less than 2% year-over-year. Our all other portfolio is down to $45 billion and has been running off at a pace of approximately $2 billion per quarter excluding loan sales. Looking at loans across our business segments, core loans grew $34 billion or 4% year-over-year.Consumer, wealth management and global banking segments each grew at a healthy year-over-year pace. As you can see in the bottom right chart, we continued to demonstrate a fairly consistent pattern of responsible loan growth.Growth of loans to consumers was led by an increase in mortgages, as lower interest rates stimulated more originations, and allowed many of our customers to lower the cost of owning their existing home or buying a new one. Within global banking, we saw increased activity for middle market clients, complementing the continued activity from large global corporate borrowers.Turning to slide 11. I'll not only review the drivers of our net interest income this quarter, but also find a few perspectives on the future given the expectation of lower rates embedded in the forward interest rate curves.Net interest income on a GAAP basis -- on a GAAP non-FTE basis was $12.2 billion, $12.3 billion on an FTE basis. Compared to Q2, 2018 GAAP NII was up $361 million or 3%. The improvement was driven by the value of our deposits as interest rates rose in 2018 as well as loan and deposit growth.On a linked quarter basis, GAAP NII was down $186 million. In Q2, we benefited from an initial day of interest as well as loan deposit growth, which was more than offset by three factors. First, lower long term rates resulted in higher prepayments of mortgage backed securities, which cause higher write-offs of bond premiums.Second, Q2 included higher funding costs from growth in non-earning trading assets and other global markets assets. And then lastly, lower short term rates reduced yields on floating rate assets such as commercial loans.As a result of these impacts, net interest yield of 2.44% declined seven basis points linked quarter, but was up three basis points year-over-year.With respect to deposit rates, we remain disciplined and saw minimal movement in total deposit repaid at 57 basis point it increased just three basis points from Q1. With LIBOR rates lower than Q1, and the forward curve predicting further declines, we would expect client deposit rates to begin to move lower over the third quarter.Turning to asset sensitivity of our banking book, we remain asset sensitive given the nature and size of our deposit base and the type of loans our customers have sought from us. Our asset sensitivity in a rising rate scenario increased compared to Q2. This was driven by the decline in mortgage rates, which increases the likelihood of mortgages -- mortgage payments in the baseline.The lower current forward curve also caused increased asset sensitivity in the falling rate scenario. In the second half of the year, we expect an NII to benefit from growth in loans and deposits, as well as an additional day of interest in Q3. However, lower rates are expected to have three primary negative effects.First, yields on floating rate assets should continue to decline from short term rate reductions. Second, lower long term rates may continue to stimulate mortgage refinancing\u2019s causing increased right off of bond premiums, and third reinvestment rates on securities and mortgages will dilute current portfolio yields. However, lower labor rates should reduce the cost of a long term debt and other funding partially offsetting these headwinds.Last quarter on our earnings call, we reviewed our expectations that net interest income could grow roughly 3% for the full year of 2019 over 2018. That was based on a relatively flat forward curve at the time of our earnings call. Since that earnings call on a spot basis, the 10-year rate has fallen more than 40 basis points and short term LIBOR rates are lower by 10 basis points or so.From here, if we were to assume stable rates, we think our NII for 2019 would now be up approximately 2% compared to 2018. Additionally, the forward curve anticipates two Fed funds rate cuts in 2019 and another in 2020.If rates follow the forward curve, and the Fed funds rate were indeed to be cut twice this year starting this month, we think it would likely shave another 1% off NII growth for 2019.Turning to expenses on slide 12, we have now been pacing at our targeted level of non-interest expense for several quarters, and our efficiency ratio has improved 100 basis points year-over-year to 57%.At $13.3 billion, we were basically flat compared to Q2, 2018 with expenses up less than $50 million. While holding expenses roughly flat, we increased investment in our people, our brand, in technology and in office space. And as you know, we are adding and renovating financial centers, which serve not only consumer clients, but also commercial and wealth management clients.Investment in people included adding more sales professionals, increased merit and benefit, as well as the shared success bonuses which we have awarded for two consecutive years now, since a portion of shares of tax bonuses best -- best over time we are now covering those programs and our ongoing expense base.Also in the expense space is the increase in early Q2 of our minimum wage to $17 an hour. And as you know, we announced our intention to continue to raise our hourly minimum wage until it reaches $20 in 2021.Compared to Q1, expenses are also up modestly as Q2\u2019s decline from the seasonally elevated Q1 payroll tax expense was more than offset by the increase in investment in initiatives and marketing in Q2.In the second half of 2019, we expect our expenses to roughly equal our first half expense of $26.5 billion. We expect increased technology investment in the second half plus the cost of adding new client facing professionals to be roughly offset by the seasonally lower incentive costs.We previously projected that we could hold 2019 flat with our 2018 expense of $53.2 billion inclusive of these planned investments. However, as you heard Brian say, we now estimate expense in 2019 will be modestly lower than that.Turning to asset quality on slide 13, asset quality continued to perform well driven by our disciplined approach to underwriting and a solid U.S. economy. As you know, the industry received annual stress test results this quarter and once again our loss rates in stress scenarios were lower than our major peers.Total net charge-offs in Q2 were $887 million a little more than $100 million lower than Q1, and the year ago quarter. The client was driven by the sale of $700 million of home equity loans, which resulted in $180 million of recoveries from previously charged-off loans.Absent this recovery, net charge-offs were just over $1 billion or 43 basis points of average loans and consistent with the net loss of rate ratio in Q1 and the prior year quarter.Outside of the normal expected Q2 seasonality in our credit card portfolio, we had a modest increase in commercial driven by a couple of single name losses.Provision expense of $857 million, excuse me provision expense was $857 million and included a modest $30 million net reserve release. Our guidance on net charge-offs from many quarters now has been roughly $1 billion per quarter and that remains unchanged. This guidance assumes current economic conditions continue.Okay on slide 14, we breakout credit quality metrics for both the consumer and commercial portfolios. With respect to consumer metrics, delinquencies trended lower, which we believe is a good indicator of future losses. Additionally, non-performing loans continued to improve even after taking into consideration the loan sales this quarter.And in commercial, we also saw a modest decline in non-performing loans, while resolvable criticized ratios remained near historic lows.Turning to the business segments, and starting with consumer banking on Slide 15, consumer banking produced another strong quarter earnings grew 13% year-over-year to $3.3 billion. Revenue grew 5% and we've created operating leverage of more than 400 basis points. The efficiency ratio also improved year-over-year to 45%.Even as we invest in new markets and renovate financial centers, the all-in 162 basis point cost of running the deposit franchise was relatively flat compared to Q2 2018 as the decline in the cost of deposits component offset the increase in rates paid.Client activity remained strong with loans and deposits showing solid growth. Mortgage originations clearly benefited from lower rates. Customer satisfaction improved, asset quality remains strong as a net charge-off ratio was 124 basis points, decreasing 4 basis points year-over-year.And I would note that much of the loan growth that we have added to our balance sheet is high quality, consumer real estate loans. We continued to add sales people for consumer lending, investment advice and small business lending. And we also increased our spend in marketing via campaign, where our 91 local market teams around the country asked their customers what they would like the power to do.Turning to Slide 16, note that the 5% year-over-year improvement in revenue was driven by NII. While card income was down modestly year-over-year, card spending grew 5% more than the prior year, which on its own was a strong quarter given elevated spending driven by tax reform last year.Versus Q1, we saw improvement in card income driven by solid purchase volumes. We continue to expect higher rewards to dampen card income, but would also remind you, that we use awards to deepen relationships with a focus on total customer revenue not just fees.Enrollment in preferred rewards increased to $5.7 million and now represents 65% of the eligible opportunity and our retention rate of these customers is now 99%.Balances with these customers grew 11% versus Q2 2018. With respect to service charges, they were also down modestly year-over-year. Again this quarter, we faced the headwinds from actions we took in previous quarters that reduced customer penalty fees.However, as with card versus Q1, we saw a modest improvement in service charges.Turning to Global Wealth & Investment Management on slide 17 strong results were driven by new investment accounts and more traditional banking products, as well as the markets rebound in the quarter. Referrals from across the company also gained momentum. Net income, which approached a record level was just over $1 billion and grew 11% from Q2, 2018.Pre-tax margin was a record 29%. The business created 240 basis points of operating leverage year-over-year as revenue increased more than 3% and expenses grew 1%. Within revenue, positive impacts from banking activities and higher rates drove NII higher while fee improvements from AUM flows and market valuations more than offset general pricing pressures.With respect to expenses, higher revenue related incentives as well as continued investment in new advisors, technology and brand were modestly offset by lower intangible amortization and deposit insurance costs.Digital use by affluent clients continues to gain momentum as mobile usage once again grew double digits year-over-year. For example, GWIM clients used E-signature twice as much as they did only a year ago.Moving to Slide 18, GWIM results reflect continued solid client engagement in both Merrill and the private bank. Strong household growth in both businesses contributed to the 2.9 trillion in client balances. AUM flows were $5 billion in Q2 or $24 billion over the past four quarters, contributing to record AUM balance, balances which rose 6% year-over-year to $1.2 trillion.On the banking side, deposits of $254 billion were up $18 million or 7% year-over-year driven by client growth and the desire by some clients to hold more cash amid the market uncertainty.Linked quarter deposit outflows reflected seasonal tax payments by our customers. Loans were 3% higher year-over-year reflecting strong mortgage growth given the decline in rates.We also saw good growth in customer lending. With respect to client activity one thing worth noting is the increase in client referrals both to and from Merrill and the private bank advisors.This quarter we had nearly 15,000 referrals, two advisors from other parts of the company and advisors made more than 58,000 referrals back to our other LOBs. In Q2 these introductions added 7 billion to client balances in GWIMs and help us grow households.As you turn to slide 19, I know many of you look at global banking and global market on a combined basis. So to help you with your comparisons, I know that as I did last quarter, that on a combined basis these two segments generated revenue of $9.1 billion and earn $3 billion in Q2 which is nearly a 16% return on their combined allocated capital.be a lot lower, GWIM and Global Banking would be a lot higher kindLooking at them on a separate basis and beginning with global banking on slide 19, the business earned $1.9 billion and generated a 19% return on allocated capital in the quarter. Earnings were strong but down 9% from Q2 2018 driven by the absence of reserve releases for energy exposure in the prior year.Revenue was down modestly year-over-year as loan spread compression and ALM activities offset the benefit of loan and deposit growth. Strong deposit and loan growth reflects hundreds of bankers we've added as well as continued investments and how we deliver our loan product and treasury services.With respect to expenses, lower deposit insurance cost mostly offset continued investment in technology and bankers. Looking at trends in slide 20 and comparing to Q2 last year, as you heard Brian mentioned earlier, we have made steady progress in investment banking over the last few quarters.We saw a nice finish this quarter with IB fees of $1.4 billion for the overall firm down 4% year-over-year, but up 9% in Q1. This performance has to be put in the context of overall industry fees which according to Dealogic were down roughly 20% year-over-year. In fact using Dealogic data our market share has improved across most major products comparing the first half of 2019 to the first half of 2018.Switching to global market on slide 21 as I usually do, I will talk about results excluding DVA. Global market produced $1.1 billion of earnings and generated return on capital 12%. Overall revenue declined 6%, while expenses declined 2% year-over-year.Within revenue, the year-over-year decline and sales and trading was partially offset by a gain on the sale of an equity investment. Sales and trading declined 10% year-over-year, FICC was down 8% while equity fell 3%. Decline in equity to $1.1 billion reflects weaker performance and EMEA derivatives compared to a stronger year ago period.Fixed lower revenue was due to a weaker trading environment with lower overall client activity across most products. The 2% year-over-year expense decline was a reflection of lower revenue- related compensation. On slide 22, you can see that our mix of sales and trading revenue remains heavily weighted to domestic activity where global fee pools are centered. Within FICC, revenue mix remained weighted towards credit products and we have no days with trading losses in the quarter.Finally, on slide 23, we show all other which reported a small net profit $358 million better than Q2 2018. There are two primary reasons for the improvement. First, provision benefit increased to $136 million from Q2 2018 driven by the non-core loan sale which as previously resulted in a recovery of $180 million.Second, we had an improvement in our tax rate compared to Q2 2018, the tax rate for the company was 18% in the quarter, a little lower than our expectations. We expect the tax rate in the back half of the year to be approximately 19% absent any unusual items.Okay. I think with that we're ready for some Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And we'll take our first question from Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead. Jim Mitchell : Hey, good morning, guys. Brian Moynihan : Good morning. Jim Mitchell : Just might as well as ask the question on NII, appreciate the guidance for this year. How do we think about I guess number one, the impact of just one rate cut is it sort of half? Is it linear? And I guess number two, as we think about next year the forward curve is realized over the course of the next 12 months. How do we think about that impact into next year? And given the strong loan growth you guys have seen kind of accelerated in 2Q, is there enough asset growth that you can still grow NII in this environment next year? Thanks. Paul Donofrio : Okay. So in terms of just isolating in on a 24 basis points cut on the short end. I guess the crude approximation is the $3 billion impact over the 12 months of a 100 basis points down rate shock on the short end. The quarterly impact of that is a little more than $175 million. But it will be even less than that because that $3 billion is measured relative to the forward curve, which already includes rate cuts, plus that analysis is just on our banking book. If you include our markets book, which is modestly liability sensitive, you get to the approximately $100 million level that I discussed in the prepared remarks.In terms of 2020, look, I would say it's a little early to be talking about 2020. We don't know what rate cuts we're going to get. We don't know why we're going to get and which is important. So I think as we get a little closer we'll be more likely to be able to talk about that. Jim Mitchell : Okay. Thanks. Brian Moynihan : Jim, I'd add one thing. Remember, if you think about the industry's thought process over the last three years basically as rates rose, that was one thought process and how people price deposits and other things, and as that changes you'll see a different thought process take hold at least in our company. And I think if you look at some of the statistics in the material on the \u2013 especially on the corporate GTS type business that the necessary increase for the highest balanced customers et cetera, that's occurred, will slow down and come back the other way and that frankly is just the nature of a change in the rate environment which the pricing is still catching up to. And so I think, so as you think about it, as you get out the longer term in 2020 you have to think about that situation sort of reversing back to a different framework than the framework we had literally 200 plus basis points of short-term rate increase. Jim Mitchell : Okay. Thanks. Operator : We'll take our next question from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Please go ahead. Glenn Schorr : Hi. Brian Moynihan : Good morning, Glenn. Glenn Schorr : Good morning. One quick one on follow-up on cards. You mentioned spending up, margin compressed and the reward costs continuing to be there, but obviously producing some growth. Can you talk a little bit more about the reward dynamic? How long the current environment you think last? And how you know that it's going to continue to fuel that growth maybe something a little bit more of growth coming from current customer base versus new ones, things like that? Thanks. Brian Moynihan : So just to start at end of your question working backwards,, we generated another million plus cards this quarter. We've been fairly consistent doing that. What has really happened in our card business over the last few years has been, they continue repositioning it, it's really over now and now you're starting to see it start to work its way up and grow just in terms of balances and numbers of cards and things like that.If you think about on the rewards question generally, remember that you mentioned it, Glenn, it's a relationship pricing piece. So our cards come with a relationship pricing across the whole relationship including deposit. So you could have $20,000 deposits from these customers and so you reward them with a card because that's the way you can do it, but you're actually getting the deposit. So, we'll keep working that. But if you look at the more recent quarterly trend you're going to see that you're seeing the impact decline. Although it still going to hit, but you're seeing that help fuel our deposit growth and checking deposits especially 6% year-over-year in consumer and that is a huge payback for the reward price.So, you'll see the dynamic continue. We haven't seen big breakage fees and that's not so volatile. It's kind of study. But the industry dynamics and how people are using rewards not only for the card activity but also more broadly as I don't expect to change, but in the Bank of America context we've been using it for the broadest part of the franchise and that's why you see the good growth in the other parts of the business. Glenn Schorr : Appreciate that. One other one, a follow-up on wealth management. You mentioned new household growth up 45% year to-date. Are you doing anything specific on incentives to spur that growth? That seems like a big number for such an already big business. And the related question is, do you think of there being a ceiling to margins because they're already huge at 29%? Brian Moynihan : Couple of things. One, on just on the way the incentive system, works. Andy and the team going back two years ago now, basically added to a modifier for lack of a better term and the incentive compensation construct for requirement bonus. If you grew your households on the numbers and obviously inverse that if you did not, and that just led to the activity that you've seen in the pick up and Andy and team has done a good job.On the private banking side, we been adding sales teammates and Katie and the team have been driving that. It's been -- it's up dramatically year-over-year and that's critically important because that business profitability and inventory are much -- are even higher. And so it does come from modifying the system and also comes from the way we operate in the markets on a referral business that is in Paul's comments you heard that. There's a huge flow between the FSAs that operate the Merrill Edge platform at the branch to the financial advisors. So somebody comes in, has the amount of assets and desires financial advisors, we move them to the platform that happens a lot.And then off the business banking, small business banking, commercial franchise, the entrepreneurs behind those businesses referred over and you saw, I think 15,000, I think it was Paul's number towards Merrill and we track that in every market. We make sure that they get executed on the [capital] [ph] success rate, and that energy creates \u2013 it\u2019s gold in every market every year and this year we will do 7 million referrals across all the businesses in the markets that we're doing. And so -- and then on the margin we move to 29. As you see NII type activities, as loans to deposits continue to grow, that margin will continue to grow.We're fighting the fee compression on the pure asset management business that you seen go on for years in this industry. But we have lots of advantage of scale and capabilities on the digitization of the operational side of that business and platforms and statements and things like that. We're getting to 50%, 60% digital statement in consumer. We're not anywhere near that in wealth management. And all that is not some snap your fingers and overnight it happens, but all the grind to make the business more efficient. So our industry-leading margin we think we can keep pushing it up. Glenn Schorr : Thanks. Appreciate everyone. Operator : We'll now go to Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Mike Mayo : Hi. I was intrigued by your comment about 16 million millennial customers, $200 billion of deposits and I think that's the first time that you've disclosed that information. So, I guess what's the growth rate profitability of those customers? And as you look at the millennial customers set what your assumption for how long they'll be customers with you since they are younger and you have more digital banking. Do you now assume that they'll be with you say 20 years instead of 10 years? And if so, how do you change the pricing of the product for that millennial customer set? Brian Moynihan : One of the things and I don't want to sound perspicacious in terms of people's use the big banks, don't do business with millennials, it just to set the tone, we put the 16 million to give you [in one sense] [ph], it's $400 billion of client balances with us. But if you look at our checking sales, Mike, and you look at the population representation millennials and the population, Gen Z and the population, you look above 18 years old and millennials about 24% and people between 18 to 24 is 11%. But if you look at the rate we sell to that class of our sales, to millennials its 40% of our sales. So it's basically one and a half times the rate and the population we're selling to.And if you look at their holding and balances today just pure checking, nothing -- not into savings or investment, the millennials hold about $70 billion of checking balance with us and its growing quickly. And so we are gaining share in that class. It's because of the digital capabilities and all the things we talked about. Are they profitable? All our consumers basically are profitable. They represent the big part of our business today. The representation is currently outstanding. Checking account is about 40% just for millennial. So, we're gaining the share in that segment. We got to be on our toes at all times and it's very valuable. If you think you like you've been around this business long time you think about just those checking balances alone provides tremendous value.Will they stay with us? The answer is they have in the past and we expect in the future as long as we keep driving the great experiences we have. And going back to the comments on the page 6 of the slide deck on consumer strategies, just look of the activity levels and those are generally would have a stronger cohort to younger below 40-year-old people. But on the other hand across the platform it wouldn't work. But if you look at it with Zelle, the activity volumes if you look at with Erica in the year, 50 million plus customer interactions and if you look at it in terms of digital interaction at 2.3 billion in the quarter, mobile log-ins 1.5 billion. This is as advanced stage as anybody and so we are very pleased with team's work in this area.And then if you go to Merrill Edge, if you look at the millennial balances, again, they represent twice the rate of the population and we're cumulating those balances which when we compare them with other competitors, 64% of our new clients are in the millennial categories for Merrill Edge and our preferred clients and things. So it's very good. We're driving it. But it\u2019s a competency of the team's capabilities in those categories that drive it. Mike Mayo : And the other question that I had, how long you assume these customers to stay with you and how does that compared to the past? The reason I ask that, you look at some of the offers out there you can get $400, $500, $600 simply for opening accounts at certain banks. And the assumption is that once you get these customers maybe they'll stay with you longer than they would have say 10 years ago? Brian Moynihan : Well, that goes back to your colleague question about the rewards and things like that. Our preferred base of customers in the consumer business is 99% plus retention rate. And so, they really all stay with this. And so, that's extremely powerful dynamic. So the assumption, I don't have, that top off my head that the team puts in our models and stuff like that, but if you're retaining 99%, it's a pretty long duration. Mike Mayo : All right. Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from John McDonald with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead. John McDonald : Good morning. Core loan growth continues to remain solid at 4%, Paul. Are you seeing some improve momentum in middle-market and small business? And also the 2% reported has closed some of the gap to that core number, I guess, as you think about the run down pace, could we continue to see a narrowing, so that your overall balance sheet growth looks closer to that core? Paul Donofrio : I guess, I'll do the second one first. The answer is yes. I mean, we have $45 billion in the non-core portfolio. Of that $45 million half I would say is sort of legacy home equity and residential mortgages that will run off and/or depending on market conditions we may see some more sales. The other half is you know mortgages that are previous Treasurer or CFO bought many years ago, its \u2013 they're good mortgages. They're going to run-off as well. Together they're running off at about $2 billion a quarter. So yes, I mean, you can just do the math. It's becoming a smaller component of the overall picture.And as you point out, look, when you look at our LOBs they were up 4% year-over-year this quarter. And we are seeing I think good growth in small business. In fact I think we are the largest lender to small business companies in the U.S. now surpassing a competitor recently. We're seeing in middle market. This quarter we saw pickup in growth that really complemented the consistent growth that we've been seeing for many quarters now from large global corporations. I mean, we don't see anything on the horizon that suggest that we can continue to grow, kind of what we been telling you which kind of the low mid-single digits for the company from the business segments. Brian Moynihan : I'd just add two thoughts to that. One is, Sharon runs our small business for us and the consumer business and Alastair Borthwick runs middle market. They got their team\u2019s sort of moving along and as you said, growing at a consistent 5%, 6%, 7% depending on the product set. Type of what's real estate slower versus core middle market. And so we feel very good about that. Remember that the runoff pace and that All Other book has been has accelerated by the sales over the last few years and that was to reduce our potential credit risk and stress and you've seen that we've reflected including last year asking for the extra capital return based on selling a bunch of loans during the year which had higher charge-offs in the CCAR process as you might expect.And then secondly operating risk of the company comes way down because those loans would have a tendency and we sell them servicing release. So, we're getting to the bottom of the barrel, its now 4% of the -- 5% of the portfolio. It used to be 8%, 9% of the total portfolio and maybe 10%. So, we feel good about that impact really narrowing now. And the sales are largely -- we always chipping away. This quarter was a relatively modest balance, but the sales are largely through. The money and stuff we have now is actually 12 years current pay and the thought on these loans were made since the crisis. So we forget about that. And the last thing is think about in the Merrill side in terms of -- in the private banking side in terms of loan growth we're seeing solid performance there and the integration in middle market investment bank and we feel good. John McDonald : Great. Brian, and then you touched on this a little bit, but could you talk about your feelings or your ability to maintain the strong checking account growth that you've had given the stance on rates paid. What your outlook for that checking account growth to continue maybe relative to GDP or to the industry? Brian Moynihan : If you look at it we have maintained that pace. If you look at retail deposit growth since beginning of 2016 I think our gross of balances has grown about 20%. The peer groups grown about 12% and so that's significant difference. We've been pretty consistent growing 20 odd billion dollars in checking. That is the core transaction account. So if you look at the \u2013 what we're seeing now is the average balance in our checking accounts I think are $7.57 billion \u2013 seven point five thousand, seven and half thousand, seven point 7 some like that. 90% current, yet we're still in the last couple years starting to net accumulate. And so we feel good that we can keep that checking balance growth.It's not depending on rate pay because of the core transactional account. So even though there's some payments to either interest-bearing checking, the dominant part is non-interest-bearing and just the core transaction account. If you look in the money market and stuff and see the rate that's where the people get paid for the excess balance. But this is the money that's flowing through the household on a daily, weekly, monthly basis and then we feel very good about it and feel that we can continue it because we have and all the environments and all the rate changes. John McDonald : Great. Thank you. Operator : We'll now go to Saul Martinez with UBS. Please go ahead. Saul Martinez : Hey, good morning guys. Couple of questions. First, I wanted to key in on something you said, Paul, on the rate sensitivity. You mentioned, I know its crude approximation, but 25 basis point cut on the short end, it's about $175 million a quarter, but that's just the banking book and your liability sensitive in your trading book. And I think you mentioned it's $100 million if you kind of net that out. So should we \u2013 is my math right in suggesting that you get something in the neighborhood of a $75 million benefit per quarter for every 25 basis point cut in your trading book? Because obviously in the past sometimes we've kind of looked at your NII growth and expansion in the rising rate environment, and maybe it hasn't grown as much as we thought because of the headwinds in the trading portfolio, but as short-term rates move down should we see the opposite side of that also occur and some of those headwinds get mitigated by expended margins in your trading book? Paul Donofrio : I think you're close, but the one piece you're missing is that in addition to being modestly liability sensitive in the trading book. When you look at those disclosures about the impact of a 100 basis point shock on the down rate scenario on the short end, remember, that's below the forward curve. Saul Martinez : Right. Paul Donofrio : So you're looking -- you're literally talking about a scenario where short end rates would be shot down to 75 basis points and long end would be at one percentage point. So that 3 billion obviously, you know it get \u2013 you have more and more impact, but the lower and lower rates go. That first 20 basis points is not going to be 3 billion divided by the [Indiscernible]. Saul Martinez : Great. Paul Donofrio : So you've got to factor in both of those things. Saul Martinez : No. Understood there, but is the logic right, I guess, is my question that you'll get an offset and that offset is sort of in that magnitude of for every 25 basis point something in the neighborhood of $75 million on the trading book? Paul Donofrio : I don't think we're prepared to give too much guidance on how liability sensitive the trading book is, but when you put all the factors together you kind of get to roughly 100 basis points, I mean, 100 million on the first rate cut. Saul Martinez : Okay. Paul Donofrio : And you know remember when I went through the script and talk about how that we'll still end up growing year-over-year 2019 versus 2018, you get a factor in loan and deposit growth. We've got the day coming in the quarter, so all those things impacted. Saul Martinez : And you're also baking in a little bit of a benefit, little bit of an offset than from expanding margins and trading book on the rate cut in that guidance? Paul Donofrio : Yes. In that guidance, we're putting in a little bit, yes. Saul Martinez : Okay. Changing gears, and apologize if I missed it, but did you disclose the size of the gain on the sale of the equity investment? Paul Donofrio : We didn't disclose the equity investment, trading, yes. No. It was $200 million. Saul Martinez : 200 million. Okay. Awesome. Thanks so much. Paul Donofrio : Thank you. Operator : We'll now go to Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Steven Chubak : Hey, good morning. So I wanted to start off with the question on the investment banking business. So it's pretty nice to fee share increasing in the quarter. We had seen some share loss in some of the more recent quarters. And I was hoping you would speak to some of the factors that maybe driving some improve business momentum whether its leadership changes or anything else that you could attribute it to? Brian Moynihan : Sure. So just a quick review, year-over-year the market fees according to Dealogic were down I think 21%. Our reported fees were down only 4%. And if you look at Dealogic fees for us, maybe 11%, so clearly we've picked up at least in this quarter meaningful I would say market share. I think this is a result of all the things that we said we were going to do, not that we ever had a problem in investment banking, but we think we should be top three and there was a little bit of slippage there. And so we just reinvigorated the focus. We decided to add more bankers particularly to cover on the middle market.Remember, we have an army of corporate -- our commercial bankers out there. They have great relationships. They've been making loans to clients for years. And there's certainly opportunity when those companies need do something, need to use investment banking product for us to be there. We just needed to probably add a few more bankers dedicated to that segment. We've done that. We've got regional bankers now all around the U.S. We're going to be adding more. They're in the market with the commercial bankers. And that and I think just the reinvigoration from the leadership team across global corporate investment bank and commercial bank and business banking, I just think is having an effect. Steven Chubak : Helpful color. And then, Paul, just one more from me and it's on the topic of NII, I mean a slightly different tack. There's obviously pretty heavier lines across the industry on the 10-Q disclosures, which I know are inherently flawed, it's a very static snapshot. Also maybe you speak to some of the doctors that are driving more benign impact in terms of the rate sensitivity that you cited versus what explicitly disclosed in the 10-Q whether it's volume growth, some issues relating to your comparing it versus the forward curve, deposit offsets or anything else you can speak to? Brian Moynihan : Just one thing to be precise, Paul said a couple of times that gets lost sometimes, and I'll let Paul get into the broader statement. When we disclosed 900 basis points shock down to 100 basis points across the curve that is on top of what the forward curve has in it. And so sometimes people get confused by that because they think its from the current rate and by stable rate environment we see today minus 100, its actually in the case of forward curve having the rest of the year two cuts and its 50 off and then another 100 off. And so that dynamic, Paul has mentioned twice that sort of make sure people don't get ahead of us. But Paul can take you through the broader factors. But just be careful that you're not making that miscalculation which we've seen other people. We're not saying you have, but other people have. Paul Donofrio : Sure. Look, I'm not sure what else I can add. I mean if you think about our clients, right, you've got GWIM clients, we've got Global Banking clients where if rate change, the pass-through rate on those clients are going to be roughly the same up or down, right. And you got consumer clients where because of the great job we've done on rate paid in the cycle, there just isn't lot of room on the downside, but if rates go up they probably be a little bit more pass-through. So that's the dynamic we're living with.On top of that you've got to factor in when long term interest rates go down, the quarter later or the month later you're going to see an impact. That doesn't continue forever. It's only an impact when the rates go down you get a lag effect on some increase in write-off of premium, and so that what's going on. Brian Moynihan : Paul, just on that this quarter a couple of basis points of the compression due to the amortization in the premium which goes away next quarter if the tenure doesn't fall by 50 basis points again during the quarter, so and another basis points sort of seasonality. So, when Paul talk about some of these sort of spot issues early on, of that seven basis points, three of it is really just literally a quarterly effect that goes away. And that's where you think -- as you think about it and go back to all the factors, listed loan growth, deposit growth, deposit pricing, loan pricing. But then the twist in the market when things change instantaneously can have a quarter affect and go away next quarter as long as rates don't move the same velocity that they move this quarter. And those are \u2013 that's why that we are always careful about these estimates to make sure people understand the online basis.Now, one of your colleagues said earlier the clue of this is we've got to grow loans and deposits. We grew $70 billion in deposit year-over-year. We grew $30-odd billion in loans. The rest of the deposit is going to securities. That is the core business and that would drive the earnings power this company and average asset growing and that's we're up to. That will ultimately make NII grow. The question is the twist and turns along the way can be little different. Steven Chubak : Very helpful, Brian. Thanks for taking my questions. Operator : Our next question comes from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Matt O'Connor: Good morning. You mentioned earlier about some puts and takes on the expenses and gave guidance for this year to be little bit below what you have thought a few months ago. But what are your thoughts kind of beyond this year? I think at one point, you have said try to keep costs relatively flat at $53 billion. And then you did mention, if I think you're alluding to call it capital market related or volume related areas if those were weaker there's some levers to pull on costs. But if it's just a lower rate environment, is there other area on the cost side that you can pull? So I guess, question is like on a stable environment your base case, what you thinking on costs? And that if the revenue shortfall is just rate driven or there's some areas that you can tie in? Brian Moynihan : So I think if you think about it over the last two years plus, I think we've ran around $13.1 billion, $13.2 billion, $13.3 billion in quarterly expenses. Except for one quarter, we had $13.8 billion, which was sort of the seasonality of a strong markets quarter plus. It was the first quarter with the FICA and stuff like that. So basically, we got this thing at a run rate. And so -- but you've got to remember, in 2019, that run rate has picked up. If you go back to when tax reform came through, we said we'd put $500 million more in the technology investment platform. A chunk of them ran through last year, and about $200 million or $300 million of it's run through this year. So that was increased expense. We said we did the share for success. We did over $1 billion in the 2 programs. There is a near-term cost to it and then there's an amortization of the deferred part, so there's stock. That's all in the P&L today. And then you have incentives, great rent and all the other stuff, the benefits. And with all that, we thought we'd be $53.2 billion, $53.3 billion this year.And Paul has told you basically to assume that we'd be closer to $53 billion with all that going on and all that extra investments. So if you go back to 2016 when we said we're running at $50 billion -- I don't know, [Indiscernible] whatever we were, we told you we'd be $53 billion, low $53 billion. Nobody believed us. We got here. We've invested a lot more and we still are running at $53 billion. That is the inherent ability of the New BAC, SIM operational excellence, org health, which not -- doesn't mean a lot to all of you, but the teammates listening will understand all that, that allows us to keep driving the relative efficiency of the company. And even in environment where the world just kind of -- so it goes on, you have 2% growth. We know there's more we can do.What we don't want you to do is to get ahead of us because, frankly, the investment year-over-year in marketing was $150 million last year, second quarter this quarter, additional in the quarter. That won't sustain at that kind of level, but it's part of driving that customer satisfaction delight scores through the roof, which then means those -- the millennial accumulation accounts of twice the rate of population, which then turns into customers, to Mike's point, of the future that the digital comp still allows us to serve more efficiency, which then drives down the efficiency ratio. That is the operating model.And so those investments pay back, and they all were down to our benefit. But that said, we're saying we gave you a flattish from 2018 to 2019 to 2020, and we're basically saying you don't push 2020 down in your models because we will see what happens. But right now, we think 2019 is going to come in a couple of hundred million under what we said, which just goes -- by the teammates here is good management. We didn't do anything. We didn't pull any lever. We just kept driving the basic efficiency of this platform through and we'll continue to do that.And if that comes in to be lower than the number we're talking about for '20 and we get there, it's going to go to you. But importantly, as we shouldn't change our investment strategy, our belief and our Board's belief and our shareholders' belief, frankly, is don't change your investment strategy because, right now, you're seeing the market share accumulations come that you wouldn't change to pick up expenses by $100 million in the quarter. $0.01 wouldn't make good, but the investments are long-term strategic drives that are happening. And just on the investment banking, adding 50 middle-market investment bankers and adding -- doubling that again over the next couple of years are paying us back. Matt O'Connor: Okay. It's helpful. And then just separately the CCAR ask an approval, impressive, 30 billion as you mentioned earlier. Do you plan to use all of that? And should we assume the timing if you do plan to use all that is spread even or do you have flexibility to the front end if you wanted to? Brian Moynihan : Yes. We plan to use all and its spread equally over the quarters under the way the method works and sort of guidance they give you. So its spread evenly over the four quarters and yes, we plan to use 100% of it. Matt O'Connor: Okay. Thank you. Operator : We'll now go to Ken Usdin with Jeffries. Your line is open. Ken Usdin : Thanks. Good morning, guys. Brian, you mentioned in your opening remarks just how strong credit is and expect it to continue. And you guys have then talk about charge-offs kind of living in the 900 to a billion range a quarter. We went under that even this quarter. So can you just talk about any reason why we should see any change in this kind of 900-ish run rate even with card losses or barely even moving as is? Just an update on what you're expecting would be great? Thank you. Brian Moynihan : I'll let Paul to hit that one, just because he talked about it. Go ahead, Paul. Paul Donofrio : So, you're right. I mean, our net charge-off were lower than a billion this quarter. But that's because we wrote back charge-offs we took earlier associated with the loans we sold this quarter. So to back that out its approximately $1 billion in net charge-off. And that number, if we think is a good number, approximately that number, it will bounce around because we're bouncing around the bottom on commercials to one commercial client or another can always move thing. But it\u2019s been a billion now or up to a billion now for many, many, many quarters and if we see the \u2013 if we think \u2013 if the environment stays where it is that's where we think it\u2019s going to be. And then provision will follow that. Brian Moynihan : And when you think about it, cards the number, right? And if you look at our live charge-off rate because sometimes growth -- we're basically consistent with our current charge-off rates, so the stable portfolio, stable credit. At the end of the day, it's 80%, 90% of all the activity, and you've seen that basically be fairly consistent. And this year is the lowest increase in card year-over-year since 2013. So that prime focused book, that primary customer account basis through the combined rewards is probably going to lead to a very, very strong customer base there.So we feel good about credit, and our view of the economy is it continues to move along in the low to mid-twos. That's what the research team has and then next year, around 2%. And given that, we would not see a change. Ken Usdin : Okay, got it. My second question is just on the preferred stack, you guys did some issuance, and I think some either pending or calls. Can you just talk about just at least where you expect the preferred dividend to lend going forward? And is there a more opportunities to refinance that part of the capital stack? Paul Donofrio : Well, we never really like to talk about plan stuff. But in terms of the preferred stack, we're going to end up roughly the same place where we started because we're just reducing the cost of that preferred stack by calling some higher yielding preferreds in place of lower-yielding preferreds. So in terms of the dividends in the first quarter and the third quarter, we're kind of approximately in the 440 range and in the second quarter and the fourth quarter we're kind of in the 240 range. That could fluctuate a little bit because it's based upon -- some of them are based upon floating rates. But on the other hand, some of those get forward after a while as well. Ken Usdin : Got it, OK. Thank you. Paul Donofrio : Thanks. Brian Moynihan : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Your line is open. Brian Moynihan : Morning, Gerard. Gerard Cassidy : Good morning, guys. How are you? Paul, I may have missed this. I apologize if you addressed it already. Can you share with us how you're managing the CET1 ratio with the stress capital buffer that may now be included in next year's CCAR? Have you guys run the numbers? And what is your CET1 ratio comes out under the SEB? Paul Donofrio : Well, our CET1 ratio and our ratio right now is 9.5. And we don't know what the final rule's going to be yet. But if you look at the past four years and you run using those scenarios, CCAR scenarios, our SEB would be below the 2.5% floor in three of the last four years. And that's just a reflection of responsible growth and how we run the company. We've got loans to consumer that are prime and super-prime. We have very prudent trading, and we've got a legacy portfolio that's running off. So we're below, we've been below for three out of the last four years. Lee McEntire : And to be clear, this is Lee. What Paul said, our CET1 was 11.7% and our minimum requirement, which is what he was referring to is the 9.5%. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And then, Brian, I know you had talked about the economy from what the research has said at Merrill Lynch, but can you share with us what your business customers are saying to you about their outlook? Obviously, the consumer numbers speak for themselves. We all see the employment numbers, which are very strong, but what are you guys seeing both in small business and midsized and larger businesses? Brian Moynihan : So, the core loan growth is strong. The usage of lines is good. It's running near the high levels and stuff, so the activity is there. I'd say that, depending on the type of commercial customer, the more they're in the global trade international supply chain, whatever words, the more they have. China has slowed down. If that's 20% of the business, they're dealing with that. But they're all sanguine. They all feel good. They all would wish the discussions of trade would come to a resolution and reestablish their relationships and the flows because the fact of the current impact is one thing, the fact that the belief that there's future impact.So I'd say they're optimistic. They're struggling to get people because that's the thing we're lacking in the U.S. especially. They see their business plans not being as robust as they were in 2018, but still solid growth, but they continue to watch the headlines daily, trying to figure out if these situations are resolved. And I think there's pent-up enthusiasm if these situations start to fall in place that you'll hear more investment in business and things like that. On the other hand, there are -- the indications in our surveys about their confidence are basically more consistent where they were as they were coming up to the peaks they hit in 2018 right after tax reform, i.e., where they were in 2017. So they've kind of come down a little bit, but the levels are as high as anytime they've been, other than -- there's tremendous business enthusiasm came out of the year in 2017 and early 2018 between regulatory reform and tax. That has been mitigated by the trade discussions and uncertainty around them. But overall, they're solid. And I think they're sort of waiting for this to resolve and then they'll get back and they'll push back and accelerate again. Right now, they're staying within the speed limits to say that. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Operator : And we'll now go to Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Your line is open. Brian Kleinhanzl : Great, thanks. Yes, just a quick question on the NII sensitivity that you gave. What were the deposit beta assumptions behind those? Are you being conservative? Just trying to get a sense there. Paul Donofrio : Sure. So again, the way to think about it, and I'll give you a little bit more detail, but just to get the concept down, we've got GWIM clients, we've got Global Banking clients that pass-through rate on an up-and-down scenario of roughly similar, and we've got a consumer franchise where we have not passed through a lot of rate increase in the former rate paid. That's obviously going to have a different sensitivity in the up scenario than in the down scenario. That's just the basics. So if you look at the pass-through rate and the down scenario an average we're talking approximately 40%, and again, consumer would be a lot lower, GWIM and Global Banking would be a lot higher kind of in that 60%, 65% range. Brian Kleinhanzl : Okay, great. Thanks. Paul Donofrio : Thank you. Operator : And we'll now go to Kevin St Pierre with KSP Research. Please go ahead. Kevin St. Pierre: Hi, good morning. Thanks. Going back to the mobile and digital trends which you're obviously really strong, but looking backwards over the last several quarters, your tax spend has been pretty flat, and you mentioned that tax spend is likely to increase. Is that a reinvestment constant investment in the mobile and digital channels? Brian Moynihan : Yes. We've been consistent. It's been -- I think what I said is we elevated tax spend after tax savings and then we've been relatively consistent. One of the things I'd say that we're receiving a benefit as you think about that number, if you think about the combinations of money spent on Brexit, broker-dealer separation for resolution planning and a bunch of other initiatives like that, we can reposition that money more toward op ends over time and that's been good. And as we look forward to the next couple of years, a flat number would actually provide more pop, for lack of a better term, and our teammates are always happy to hear that.But these things are impacts that compound. And so I'll give you an example. If you look at digital mortgage, which the $3 billion were digitally originated this quarter of the 18, so it's growing. But it took us a year -- a little over a year to do the first $1 billion. It took us eight weeks to do the second $1 billion. It took us six weeks to do the third $1 billion. So what happens with these implementations is -- the technology investments made and then it ramps up. And what's really happening in digital mortgage, remember is it's actually saving us a lot of money in the origination process as well as be a good client experience.And so you take that or take Erica, which is now moved to several million customers, you can see 50 million interactions first year. But each month, it's growing. Business -- small businesses went out, and it's going at 50% a week type of numbers, even though we haven't told people it's out there and things like that.And so now growing $100 billion year-over-year. Checks written are coming down more effectively. All this really points to the compounding effect of that digitization. So that consistent investment renders benefits two, three, five years out, and that's what we're driving at. So we'll be consistent in our investment. There's only so much you can do. We do about 1 million lines of coding every weekend and conversion so to speak. And there's -- you've got to be careful you don't have a problem, and we've -- knock on wood.Cathy and the team have done a great job, and we haven't seen any issues that we've implemented tremendous new codes, so to speak over the course of years here. And so we are bound more by what we can get done and getting the benefits out of it than we are by money. Kevin St. Pierre: Great. And I noticed the digital appointment continue to grow really strongly. Are you at a point where and I noticed that sort of year-over-year and sequentially your financial center numbers are pretty stable. Can we assume that the foot traffic that's being driven you make sure you think you're at right critical mass of financial centers? Or can we expect over time continued consolidation and rationalization there? Brian Moynihan : We'll see the numbers not be as dramatic from the 6,100 to the 4,300 obviously, but it's a complete distribution system. So the ATMs have gone up from 16,000 up to, I think 18,000 or something number now. Rates have come down. The branches are completely different. They're bigger. They have more people in them. People go to them because of more complex needs, etcetera versus take the transaction side, take the check and deposit. So we're driving more co-location.But if you think about the real interesting news is, remember at the end of the day, we have the number one retail deposit share in the United States. We're growing faster than anybody else, but we're still not in several markets in the top 30 markets and that's what we're building out, whether it's Indianapolis, whether it's the Minneapolis, whether it's Denver, whether it's now Cincinnati, Columbus.And we are in Pittsburgh, and there's many other cities in the top 30 and top 50 that we have to figure out how we drive a configuration against them over the next piece of time here. So the actual branch count may have different elements than you would have thought going back to the constant down. But you see it drift down a little bit net, net, net because even in major cities, the consolidation of branches into bigger enterprises or co-location with Merrill teammates or Business Banking teammates or small business teammates and private banking teammates is part of the drive.So don't get so focused on that. What I would get focused on is actually the cost of operating the platform. And if you look at that year-over-year it fell by 4 basis points as a percent of deposits. That is phones. That is everything. And if you think about that, if you add that in the cost of deposit repaid, you're basically flat year-over-year and the total cost of goods sold for lack of a better term to produce this wonderful transaction franchise and consumer and further the loans franchise on top of it and the investment franchise on top of that. It is a powerful engine, but it's a combination of everything that we \u2013 that I just talked about not five less branches or four or less this. Kevin St. Pierre: Great. Thanks, very much. Operator : And we'll now go to Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Vivek Juneja : Hi. Thanks for taking the question, a couple of questions. Firstly, since it was, you pointed out Brian and Paul couple of times about making sure that we take account of the fact that your NII guidance is based on over and above the forward curve. So let's step back, given that that may not be as realistic or likely to happen. What is the outlook for NII if the forward curve is realized when you look out over a 12-month period. I know you've given a second half, but since these things are not linear, can you give us a sense of what --what would that be on NII, what would NII do with the forward curve being realized? Brian Moynihan : Well I'm not sure, I quite followed your question Vivek. But just to be very clear\u2026 Vivek Juneja : Well could\u2026.sorry go ahead. Paul Donofrio : Well, the asset sensitivity of the company, those disclosures that you read in the Q, that is in excess of the forward curve. What we were talking about earlier in this call, somebody asked about what were the next 25 basis points and we went through what we thought the impact of that was. Brian Moynihan : Great. And I think Paul\u2019s statements earlier in the prepared remarks are exactly what you're saying, which is stable rates and follow the forward curve of rest of 2019 and he gave you \u2013 those that 2% to goes to 1% growth 2018 to 2019. Vivek Juneja : Right. Right. Now you\u2019ve given that for 2019 and I'm I guess asking for a fuller 12 months rather than just simply the second half. Brian. Brian Moynihan : Oh he did. We said that we you know as we watch what happens over the next few months, we can do better we'll have a better view of given you 2019 or 2020 excuse me. But you think of the run rate exiting 2019 at that level and you can add two more quarters to it, but loan growth, deposit growth, whether the cut comes, when it comes, those are all factors in there. So I think Paul said, we'll talk about that next quarter when we know a little bit more. Vivek Juneja : Okay. Okay, so let\u2019s move to another one. Residential mortgage loan growth accelerated sharply this quarter far more than we've seen in the last couple of years, actually probably in dollar mark, double of what you've seen in the quarter. And that's despite lower rates and more refire. So are you holding on to some conforming, or is there such a sharp increase in jumbos? Brian Moynihan : We have -- we have held all mortgages for six, seven years now. Vivek Juneja : We mean even the conforming. Brian Moynihan : We sell -- we basically sell the FHA, VA that and everything else that goes on a balance sheet, because frankly the risk in our mortgage portfolio isn't worth passing to someone to take the risk away from us. And so, that increase is just due to purely the origination platform basically went from $1 billion last year, second quarter to 18 this quarter, maybe nine last quarter year so. That all goes on and increases the growth rate. And then, we're not also in the aggregate sense, remember not selling as much of the portfolio in the current environment but, but we have not sold mortgages to the secondary market for years other than the FHA VA product. Paul Donofrio : But remember we're focused on prime and super prime. These are our customers. We feel good about the risk. Vivek Juneja : Okay. Got it. One tiny detail, trade web game. I know $200 million was the amount you gave. Is that included in other income or is that actually in trading? Paul Donofrio : That was not included in the external sales and trading numbers that we presented in the -- that I discussed today and we presented in the materials. It's in other income in global markets. So it's in the revenue but not in sales and trading. Vivek Juneja : Okay, great. Thank you. Paul Donofrio : Thank you. Operator : We'll now go to Andrew Lim with Societe Generale. Please go ahead. Andrew Lim : Hi, thanks for taking my questions. I'm just looking for a bit more color on the net interest, sort of the deposit side in terms of mix and rates. So this is related to slide nine. So you know we see here the interest bearing deposits struggling to grow interest and deposits growing quite nicely. And that's very much emanating from what's going on in the global banking side.So just wondering if you could talk a bit more about competitive dynamics as to why it's a bit more difficult to grow your non-interest bearing deposits especially in the global banking side?And then my second question is relating to the interest bearing deposit side. So if we looked at a supplement, then the interest rate paid has gone up by 4 basis points. Could you talk about what's driving that? So simply the beta is going up? And then how would you expect that to develop in that declining rate environment?And then my third question is that, your interest rate guidance and on the yield is based on a static deposit mix. What would you take into account some further mix shifts as we've seen there? Brian Moynihan : Okay, well let's start with non-interest bearing deposits. And you know you'll have to help me remember your questions as we go through here. So on non-interest deposits, we are growing non-interest bearing deposits in consumer of growing low interest tracking and consumer. Those are -- that's really where you find conceptually the non-interest bearing deposits in the company.Global banking, we have interest bearing deposits and non-interest bearing deposits. But remember, we paid ECR on the non-interest bearing deposits. The -- as interest rates rise, corporations that were very comfortable leaving excess funds in their non-interest bearing account when rates were lowered. They just get a little bit more careful, and they only leave what in their non-interest bearing accounts what they need, to do their transactions. Think about it like the daily sort of transactions that those quietly they do and any excess liquidity, they're probably pushing into non-interest bearing plus outside the U.S. they don't really have the confidence of non-interest bearing and interest bearing. It's all interest bearing.So what you should focus on is the fact that we grew deposits in global banking 12% year-over-year. That reflects the sophistication and value we're bringing clients from that treasury services platform and it reflects the bankers we've added, and the relations that they have in the U.S. and around the world. 12% growth in and the climb is gone at 2% feels good to us. So that, that\u2019s all in for the first question. What was the second question? Andrew Lim : The rates on your -- non, on your interest bearing deposits. As we look to your -- to your supplement disclosure, then I think we're looking at as a U.S. interest bearing deposit rate going up 4 basis points from 73 to 77. Paul Donofrio : Yes. I mean, that is probably just reflects the mix shift that we've just been talking about in global banking, that's up. There wasn't a lot of increase other than maybe a little bit of exception pricing and consumer. GUM I think was relatively flat and in global banking, when you have a mix shift, you're going to see more deposits go in to the interest bearing, you going to see an increase in the overall deposit rate of company. Andrew Lim : And would expect that mix shift to continue going forward? Paul Donofrio : Well, I don't know if he's going to continue. It depends what their environment does. Brian Moynihan : Remember, it really is a question of looking into different businesses, because consumers are checking growing growth 41 consecutive quarters, so that you know that you should expect the trends there to continue like we said earlier in the call were -- were the institutional business in the global banking business. As rates moved, you saw a movement, and then that movement will stabilize as rates stabilize or if they come down, you actually see the thing come back the other way a little bit. And if you look at the wealth manager\u2019s sort of half way between, and you have to then think about the use of cash. Some as transactional, some as investment oriented are either trying to get a yield on it. And where people put money depends on that, and that becomes more exacerbated, more prevalent in the -- in the wealth wealthier part of the consumer client base, then in obviously institutional client base.So we do use it, when we make our estimates I think was a third party question. We estimate mix as deposits -- deposit growth by categories, by the growth by business line, and we think of all that. And all that's factored in into the question Paul, discussion Paul had with you. I don't want to be stubborn here, but you've got to remember that you back up and think about it $70 billion of deposit growth all a hugely advantaged cost to fund all the core customers is what we drive in this, in one part of our business here. That is a tremendous impact and half of it from the consumer side and then 20 billion in checking in our own, in our consumer deposits segment. These are massive growth engines that exceed the size of many institutions. Andrew Lim : That's great. Thanks very much. Operator : And our last question today is a follow up from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Mike Mayo : Hi, Your AOCI I guess it got better by what, $2.5 billion linked quarter, so that's good. You got it from lower NII growth this year. Investors don't necessarily like that. So I guess, I'm asking you this environment with lower interest rates. I know investors don't like guidance lower for credit revenues, but how do you think about it, because while you have lower guidance to spread revenues, you also have better values of those securities better AOCI, better capital and better book value. So when you look at that tradeoff, how do you think about it? Do you think of monetizing from those securities, gains you get as worried as investors, and you say, hey this is fine. You look at the economic value of the firm, we're not paying attention to a few basic points here or there. Brian Moynihan : We look at the long term Mike as you are well aware and going back to your earlier question. So, we always look at what the most efficient use of all the dynamics you talked about, but we we're not here to trade the balance sheet. We're here to let the customer activity come through it and then optimize that for the shareholder. But and so I, the AOCI came up this quarter. People always forget about that that's the offset to the NII debate with lower rates going forward as the current long term securities you have are worth more and we invest every quarter about half treasuries and half mortgage backs in those treasuries are now advantaged when from the last whatever period of time.And so -- so we don't try to say let's try to get a penny here as you said because at the end of day we're driving that long term value of the franchise. So I think the spirit of your question is you know you manage a company for the long term value, the answer is absolutely yes. And do we -- are we mindful of trying to optimize things on a given day, months, week, quarter? Yes. But the reality is that we always make the decision for long term value of the company. And the real solve here that you -- that you referenced is, our capital keeps growing even though we're returning a 100% of it and we have an excess for many of the constraints in the CCAR that is tens of billions of dollars, and we're going to turn part of that. That's driven by how we run the company for last decade not how we ran it this week. And we're getting the payback for that. Mike Mayo : And then last follow up. Just this whole discussion of low interest rates assumes that maybe we're going to head into recession, maybe activity is falling down. You have better data than we have. So what's your read on the economy? What's your overall read just on the conditions for you to do business? Brian Moynihan : We don't see any condition. If you think of the U.S. economy, it\u2019s two thirds driven by the consumers, and if you think about the employment level, the job counts. You think about the wage growth. I mean you think about the wage growth in our firm, which exceeds the national averages by two and three times and a lot of my peers I talked to not only in our industry, outside it, wages paying their teammates are much higher their share in the benefits of their success. We do not see anything that says, the U.S. consumer and our business is spending 5% more plus than they did last year for the second quarter. It has grown first quarter second quarter. It is accelerating, and we're in a borrowing in good shape. We don't see anything consistent with a recession. What we can see is, is consistent with a 2% plus growth rate versus a 3% growth rate largely due to the impacts of some of the benefits of tax reform and other things running through the economy last year.And so we feel very, it\u2019s very solid. And so yes, there is a slowdown but that slowdown was predicted by everybody and now you're seeing it evidenced, but you're actually seeing it pick up a little bit in the consumer side from first quarter, second quarter and we'll see how that plays out Mike. Mike Mayo : All right. Thank you. Operator : We have no further questions at this time. It is now my pleasure to turn our call back over to Brian Moynihan for closing remarks. Brian Moynihan : Thank you very much for your time and your interest in our company. We had a strong quarter of record earnings. We have continued to manage it the right way. Growing responsibly by driving customer growth, by managing the risk well, and by investing in the franchise on a sustainable basis. We\u2019ll continue to do that. We're moderating environment is the question Mike just said, in terms of focused on, any end issue we see where we have to change the operating model. But we continue to deliver a good share of value and plan to push the capital back to you that come off this wonderful franchise that we have. Thank you. Operator : This does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at anytime.",

Later, you will have an opportunity to ask questions during the question-and-answer session. Please note this call maybe recorded. I\u2019ll be standing by should you need any assistance. It is now my pleasure to turn today's conference over to Lee McEntire. Please go ahead. Lee McEntire : Good morning. Thanks for joining the call to review our third quarter results. I trust everybody has had a chance to review the earnings release documents. They are available on the Investor Relations section of bankofamerica.com\u2019s website. Before I turn the call over to our CEO Brian Moynihan, let me remind you that we may make forward-looking statements during the call. After Brian's comments, our CFO, Paul Donofrio will review more details of the third quarter results. We'll then open up for questions. Please try to limit your questions so that we can get to all the callers. And for more information on the forward-looking comments we may make, please refer to either our earnings release documents, our website, or the SEC filings. With that, take it away, Brian. Brian Moynihan : Thank you, Lee. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to review our third quarter of 2019 results. These results reflect our success, and the U.S. economy continues to grow at around the 2% GDP level. In that kind of economy, our job is simple, drive solid customer activity, manage risk well, manage expenses well, all while investing heavily in our competitive advantage. That's what we've been telling you, it\u2019s been what we call responsible growth. The investments we have been making in the franchise for many years and our disciplined responsible growth approach are evident across every line of business results in respective customer basis you'll see in the materials. Today, we reported $5.8 billion in after-tax net income and $0.56 per share for the third quarter. Those results include a previously announced $2.1 billion pre-tax impairment charge.  This charge relates to the investment in our Bank of America merchant services joint venture from 2009 that negatively impacted our EPS by $0.19. That charge, however, positioned us to meaningfully invest in our -- integrate our payments platforms in our commercial side businesses over the next several years. Excluding that charge, third quarter net income was a record $7.5 billion after-tax and EPS of $0.75 per share.  On this adjusted basis, net income increased 4% from the third quarter of 2018 while earnings per share increased 14%. This reflects an 8% reduction in average diluted shares from third quarter of 2018. Returns after adjusting for the impairment charge were strong. Return on assets, about 123 basis points, return on tangible common equity of 15.6%.  So, before Paul dives into the quarter's results through the lines of business, I wanted to cover a little bit about client activity costs and operating leverage at an enterprise level. These are the items that we focus on for you that allows us to drive our competitive advantage, but first some general context around the operating environment. Despite the repeated discussions or the continuing discussions around the potential recession in the United States, I want to offer some data from our customer base, which represents the activity as a substantial portion of the American consumers.  Our annual customer outgoing payments on the consumer side of our Company are nearly $3 trillion or about -- when compared to U.S. economy about 15%. Consumer payments year-to-date are up 6% compared to the same period in 2018 through the nine months. For the third quarter, that pace was as solid or slightly increased from earlier in the year. This means the U.S. consumer continues to benefit by strong employment prospects. Now, interesting on the commercial side of clients, at roughly $325 billion in average U.S. commercial loans outstanding, we do see a lot of client flows as the market leader in United States. Our total commercial loans grew 6% compared to the third quarter of 2018 with good middle market utilization rates. And importantly, our small business segment also grew 6%.  As such, we are the largest U.S. commercial lender and the largest small business lender in the United States according to the FDIC data. This solid activity means that commercial customers continue to fare well. These are tangible examples that the U.S. economy is still in solid shape, despite the worries and concerns about trade wars, capital investment slowdowns, or other global macro conditions. Now, let's turn to Slide 3. Across nearly every line of business, we are seeing strong customer activity. You can see that on the slide. I won't take you through all the statistics here but let me highlight a few. On the consumer business on the left hand side of the slide, our deposit growth has consistently been above the average \u2013 the industry average for many periods. It's axiomatic that we're gaining market share.  And not just in balances, but year-to-date, we've seen something that's interesting to us. We've had a 2% growth in a number of net checking households, a 700,000 increase. This is the fourth year of good growing net checking households after a decade of consolidation of accounts. Relationships and other changes to our business have began a decade ago to reposition. It is also record levels at primary accounts, and record levels at total balances and average balances in those checking accounts. 92% of our customers we have, it's primary checking account and household, and the average balances reached $7,000.  Now through a renewed focus on growth in our wealth management franchise, Andy Sieg and Katy Knox are leading the charge, and we've seen net new Merrill Lynch and private banking relationships, up over 30% plus in each case. And we're expanding the franchise by bringing our retail franchise, our Consumer Banking franchise to markets where we had long established wealth management or commercial client coverage. Paul is going to cover the continued growth in digital uses across our client base, which provides an important dual benefit of strong customer service and lower cost structures.  Now, in the commercial and corporate side, as you can see on the right-hand side of the slide, as well as the institutional investor coverage we have, we are also growing the client bases. We have been investing in the client facing teammates in our commercial banking for a few years, and we've increased our investment banking coverage, especially in the middle market and we've added new traders and sales staff in Europe as we opened our Paris brokerage office. As you can see, these efforts are deepening relationships with 3% growth in solutions per household, customer relationship and commercial. This investment has led to an improvement in our client coverage and investment banking market share. Earlier this quarter, my teammate, Tom Montag highlighted some of the gains we are making in middle market investment banking coverage at a conference. We expect to see that can -- we have seen that continued success and we expect for it to continue in the future as we continue to bring our capabilities to our great commercial banking franchise in the United States. Let's turn to Slide 4. This increase in client activity can be seen in growth in deposits and loans. On Slide 4, we look at the deposits. Average deposits grew $59 billion or 4.5% year-over-year. For four years now, we have grown deposits compared to the prior year for every one of those quarters by more than $40 billion when compared to the year before, all while we improved the mix of deposits. Deposits with our consumers grew $38 billion in total or 4% reflecting the value clients place on the relationship benefits offered by the convenience of our network, the value of our leading digital capabilities and our unique preferred rewards program.  Global wealth manager was responsible for $16 billion of that $38 billion in consumer deposit growth, reflecting client expansion and preference to hold cash and move investments as well as inflows of about $8 billion from the conversion of some money market funds and deposits at year-end 2018. Our Consumer Banking deposits grew by $22 billion or 3% year-over-year. More importantly, you can see in the right hand side -- upper right-hand side of the slide that these came from checking balance growth. One additional point we'd focus on here is a long-term trend of deposit growth even in a moving rate environment.  When the Fed started raising rates at the end of 2015, many of you had questions whether our deposits could continue to grow and what rates we'd have to pass through to the customers. Since the end of 2015, our average consumer banking deposits are up $145 billion in balances, three quarters of that coming from checking accounts. These balances are either no interest or very low interest on a core relationship in the households of America. Our rate paid remains low due to that superior mix of deposits. Now, when you look at global banking in the lower right-hand side of the slide, $23 billion in deposit growth reflects a rising rate environment and the additional bankers we have deployed over the last few years to continue to sell our superior global transaction services, capabilities.  As we move to Slide 5, we see the loan side of the equation. Overall average loans are up nearly 4% year-over-year despite selling about $9 billion of non-core consumer real estate loans out of the all-other category over the last year. Average loans on line of business had grew $52 billion or 6% year-over-year, as both consumer and commercial loans both grew at a 6% pace. Middle market borrowing as I said earlier, continued to complement large corporate financings.  As you can see in the bottom right-hand chart, we continue to demonstrate a fairly consistent range of responsible loan growth in our commercial businesses in all our business segments. Within consumer, you'll note that strong residential mortgage growth, but also the more stable credit card balances, which reflect our decision last year to continue to manage less profitable promotional balances down or driving core balances and our relationship, especially in preferred rewards capabilities. Within commercial, I want to highlight a couple of areas of activity important to understand as you think about commercial clients in the state of the U.S. economy. First, as I said earlier, small business lending. Over the last year, we've grown small business loans 6% regaining our market position as the number one lender to small businesses in the United States. Supplying capital small business is very important as they are the key driver employment in the U.S.  As we continue to innovate around capabilities and offerings in important client base, another portfolio with our commercial loans and leases book is our global equipment financing portfolio. Growth in this portfolio is a sign that commercial clients have invest \u2013 are investing capital in the U.S. economy at a faster pace in the overall economic growth. This portfolio is $65 billion, and it grew $6.5 billion plus or 11% in the past 12 months. This reflects investments by clients and equipment to drive their business, invest in renewable energy products. These are just a couple of examples within our stable lending portfolio is growing and supporting clients in a real economy and growing the size of smaller competitors' entire lending portfolios.  As we look to the expense side of the equation on Slide 6, we've been driving a responsible growth. Part of that is to have sustainable growth, which it means we self fund our investments and find ways to handle the inflationary cost to keep expenses relatively flat, while we continue to invest heavily, $3 billion in technology, new branches, new team mates. Slide 6 shows a two-year expense trend here. I'll talk about the expense on Slide 6, excluding the impairment charge we took in our investment in Bank of America merchant services. We've been operating in a tight range of $13 billion to $13.3 billion with only one exception for last few years. So we've been able to operate at $53 billion annualized expense base, despite increased investments in technology and infrastructure and buildings and people and philanthropy and other costs. At $13.1 billion this quarter, we were basically flat compared to quarter three, 2018 despite elevated litigation costs of about $350 million compared to a six quarter run rate of about $100 million per quarter. Regarding head count, year-over-year head count went up -- it went up in the sales professional category by 1,700 people. We offset that cost through reduction in other team mates. As you look to the next slide, Slide 7, you see the familiar operating leverage trend, which has been a highlight for the firm's culture funding investments through operational earnings. Despite the immediate revenue impact of a lower interest rate environment and other revenue challenges with a slowing economy, we have a good track record of generating operational savings, we're able to keep it operating leverage relatively flat, essentially expenses and revenue grew about $500 million \u2013 less than $500 million each. On a more core operating basis taking account the elevated litigation, you could see operating leverage even in this difficult environment. As I've said before, generating operating leverage does get tougher when we told you that over the last several quarters, after four successful years of keeping expenses, declining and holding relatively flat. This will continue especially to work through periods of interest rate cuts, but we remain focused on our mission to continue to grow revenue faster and expenses.  The question we ask ourselves is how much flexibility and the question you ask us is how much flexibility we want to leverage from initiatives spending on technology or infrastructure or hiring. But we just keep or do we keep investing to build our market share momentum. As we talk to the investors who own substantial portions of our stock, they continue to tell us to invest in our client and customer successes, to take the advantage of our strong position and continue to invest in times. But even with that, you can see in this chart that we maintain our discipline around operating leverage. With that, I'm going to turn it over to Paul for few details in the quarter. Paul Donofrio : Thanks, Brian. I'm starting on Slide 8 with the balance sheet. Overall, compared to the end of Q2, the balance sheet grew $30 billion, driven by loan growth, which ended the quarter more than $9 billion higher. We also grew the balance sheet in Global Markets to support additional client activity. Liquidity remained strong, as average liquidity sources were unchanged, linked quarter.  Shareholders' equity declined $3 billion, driven by a $2 billion decline in common equity. As positive OCI from lower rates and net income totaling $7 billion was more than offset by $9 billion of capital return to shareholders through common dividends and share repurchases. The remaining $1 billion decline in equity resulted from the redemption of preferred stock in Q3 after issuing lower yielding preferred shares in Q2.  With respect to regulatory metrics we remain comfortably above our minimum requirements. Regarding CET1 ratios given the reduction in capital I just reviewed, our CET1 ratio standardized, decreased to 11.4%, which is nearly 200 basis points above our minimum requirement. And as mentioned in our SEC filings, the impairment charge recorded this quarter reduced regulatory capital, but had no impact on our capital plans announced in July. Our risk-weighted assets increased modestly as a result of increased client activity and higher loan balances across the businesses. Lastly, our TLAC ratios also remained comfortably above our requirements. Turning to Slide 9 and net interest income, on a GAAP non-FTE basis NII was $12.2 billion, $12.3 billion on an FTE basis. Compared to Q3 2018 GAAP NII was up $126 million or 1%. The year-over-year improvement reflects solid loan and deposit growth as well as modestly higher average short-term rates year-over-year. As you know lower rates are a headwind. The Fed cut short-term rates in July and September and average long end rates are down over 100 basis points year-over-year. However, versus the linked quarter GAAP NII was flat. There were two primary negative impacts to NII in the quarter. First, lower short-term rates reduce yields on floating-rate assets, and second, because of lower long-term rates, we experienced faster prepayments on mortgage-backed securities, increasing the level of bond premium write-offs. Offsetting these negative impacts were one additional day of interest, loan and deposit growth, reduction in the cost of our long-term debt and a small decline in the interest rate paid on deposits. In addition, Global Markets NII benefit from lower funding costs and a shift in mix of client activity. While NII improved in Global Markets, results are better assessed by studying together, both NII and trading account profits as client activity from one quarter to the next can shift in mix between these two revenue lines. In fact, sales and trading revenue in the quarter, which includes both NII and trading account profits, was down slightly versus Q2. With regard to deposit pricing, we were disciplined. First, note that customers who have borrowed from us on a variable rate basis benefited from an approximate 30 basis point decline in LIBOR on a linked quarter basis. At the same time, we lowered the rates on interest bearing deposits by 5 basis points to 76 basis points, roughly half of our $1.37 trillion deposit book in our consumer banking businesses, where our customer pricing remained relatively unchanged, while the deposit rate we pay in global banking and wealth management declined 12 basis points versus Q2. As you know, in our banking book, we have more variable rate assets than variable rate liabilities given the quality of our deposits, particularly in Consumer Banking. This makes us asset-sensitive in our banking book or perhaps it would be more descriptive to call us liability insensitive. In any case, this asset sensitivity increased compared to Q2, driven by the forward curve at the end of September, which was lower than the curve at the end of Q2. Looking forward, on our Q2 earnings call, we reviewed our expectation that net interest income could grow roughly 1% for the full year of 2019 over 2018. That expectation has not changed. Despite the lower long end rates and the expectation for another short end rate cut in Q4. Nor have we changed our expectation that Q4 NII [indiscernible] Q3. In Q4, we expect the decline in short-term rates will more fully affect yields on our variable rate assets. In addition, given the decline in long end rates over the past couple of quarters, reinvestment rates on securities and mortgages is expected to dilute current portfolio yields. However, LIBOR rates have reduced the cost of our long-term debt and the funding of our Global Markets business, this plus loan and deposit growth are expected to partially offset the headwinds. Turning to asset quality on Slide 10. We saw no meaningful change in asset quality, which continues to be strong. We have maintained our responsible underwriting standards for years now and we remain disciplined again this quarter in a relatively solid U.S. economy. Similar to Q2, we sold some non-core consumer real estate loans, where the sales price was above our carrying value due to prior charge-offs. This resulted in recoveries that reduced net charge-offs and provision expense in both Q3 and Q2 this year. Recoveries in Q3 and Q2 were $198 million and $118 million respectively. Including these recoveries, total net charge-offs in Q3 were $811 million compared to $887 million in Q2. Adjusting for the charge-offs, excuse me \u2013 adjusting for the recovery excuse me, net charge-offs were just over $1 billion in both periods, and the net charge-off ratio would be 42 basis points in Q3 and 43 basis points in Q2. On that adjusted basis and comparing to Q3 2018, net charge-offs were $77 million higher, reflecting modestly higher commercial losses and seasoning of card losses. Provision expense was $779 million and included a modest $32 million net reserve release. The prior year period includes a $216 million reserve release driven in part by energy releases. On Slide 11, we breakout credit quality metrics for both our consumer and commercial portfolios, and as you can see, asset quality remains strong. Consumer non-performing loans declined as a result of the loan sales and in commercial, ratios tracking non-performing loans and reservable credit size exposure remained near historic lows. Turning to the business segment, and starting on with consumer banking on Slide 12. Consumer banking produced another solid quarter of revenue and earnings growth. Earnings grew 5% year-over-year to $3.3 billion. Revenues grew 3%. We believe our efficiency ratio of 45%, which is one of the lowest among our peers is driven by our digital delivery platform and simplified product offerings which enables not only ease of use, but also efficiency. Our investments in this business continued at a steady pace and client activity remained strong with respect to loan and deposit growth, as well as consumer spending. Again this quarter, we added salespeople expanded in new and existing markets, renovated financial centers and improved capabilities for consumers, as well as small businesses. And even as we continue to invest, the cost of deposit year-over-year declined to 150 basis points nearly offsetting the increase in rate paid, which is now 11 basis points. Deposit growth was up $22 billion or 3% and centered in low rate checking. Loan growth was up 7% year-over-year. The low long-term rate environment continued to generate momentum and consumer real estate as new originations nearly doubled from last year to more than $20 billion. Asset quality in the segment remained strong as the net charge-off ratio was 118 basis points, down modestly from both last year and the previous quarter. In addition, we saw origination spreads improve in both mortgage and consumer vehicle lending during the quarter. Consumer investment assets grew $19 billion to $223 billion, a strong client flows were partially offset by market declines. Turning to Slide 13, note that our 3% year-over-year improvement in revenue was driven by both NII as well as fees. NII benefited from deposit and loan growth. Card income was up 4% year-over-year as we experienced solid spending levels, partially offset by rewards, which continue to be a headwind. Each quarter we show you the improvement in the consumer digital statistics, which are highlighted on Slide 14. Customers continue to transact and interact with us in person as well as through digital channels. So we continue to invest in both, by adding financial centers and renovating existing ones as well as enhancing and adding capabilities to our number one ranked digital banking platform. In fact over the past year we have opened 98 financial centers, renovated 562 and installed nearly 1,000 ATMs and remain on track to hit our build-out targets. This includes opening financial centers in three new major U.S. markets in the past year, where we had previously no retail presence. And remember, while many are new markets, additions from a retail perspective, other lines of businesses like commercial banking, Merrill and our private bank have been serving customers for decades in these markets. Turning to digital. In the third quarter, we saw nearly 2.5 billion consumer interactions across all channels. With digital accounting for more than $2 billion [indiscernible] and digital sales now represent 26% of total sales. And by the way, our digital and physical worlds are increasingly connected and synergistic. Digital appointments are great example of that. 13% of our financial center platform traffic is now driven by appointments set in advance. This allows us to better prepare and staff for the specific needs of our customers and improve their experience. Turning to Global Wealth and Investment Management on Slide 15. Strong results were aided by growth across AUM, loans and deposits and generally good market conditions in the quarter. Client balances are approaching $3 trillion. As a result of flows and market valuations. Referrals across the Company remained strong. Net income was $1.1 billion and grew 8% from Q3 2018. Pre-tax margin was a record 30%. The business created nearly 300 basis points of operating leverage year-over-year, as revenue increased 2% while expenses declined 1%. Within revenue, positive impacts from growth in deposits and loans drove NII higher asset management fees grew year-over-year as fees from AUM flows and market valuations more than offset general pricing pressures. Transactional revenue declined modestly versus Q3 2018. With respect to expenses, investments in sales professionals, technology and our brand were more than offset by lower intangible amortization and deposit insurance costs. Mobile channel usage among wealth management household grew 45%. Moving to Slide 16, GWIM results reflect continued solid client engagement in both Merrill and the private bank. Strong household growth contributed to higher client balances which exceeded $2.9 trillion. AUM flows were nearly $6 billion in Q3 or $21 billion in the past 12 months, boosting AUM balances to a record $1.2 trillion. On the banking side, average deposits of $254 billion were up $16 billion or 7% year-over-year driven by client growth and 2018 year-end conversion of balances from money market funds. Average loans were 5% higher year-over-year, reflecting strong growth in mortgage and custom lending. As you turn to Slide 17, before I review the slide, and as I\u2019ve done in the past I want to provide summary information on Global Banking and Global Markets on a combined basis to allow comparison against competitors that may not break out these business separately. So on a combined basis, these two segments grew revenue to $9.1 billion and earned nearly $3 billion in Q3, generate a return of more than 15% on their combined allocated capital. Looking at them separately and beginning with Global Banking, the business earned $2.1 billion and generated a return of more than 20% on allocated capital. Earnings were strong, up 3% from Q3 2018, driven by an increase in investment banking income and leasing related gains. The year-over-year growth in earnings was mitigated by the absence of prior year reserve releases, primarily from energy exposures. Growth in investment banking fees was the largest contributor to the 8% improvement in revenue year-over-year. Strong deposit and loan growth reflects the benefits of adding hundreds of bankers over the past few years, as well as continued advancements in how we deliver our loan product and treasury services. Expenses were up 4% as we continue to invest in technology and client facing associates. Looking at trends on Slide 18 and comparing to Q3 last year. As you heard Brian mentioned earlier and Tom discussed at an investor conference last month, we have made steady progress in investment banking over the past year. Our steady progress with clients is reflected in both our improved fees, as well as market share rankings and lead tables. IB fees in Q3 were more than $1.5 billion for the overall firm up 27% year-over-year. Advisory was particularly strong at approximately $450 million as we advised on five of the top 10 transaction completed in the quarter. Pointing to our strength in leadership and credit underwriting, activity in debt capital markets was strong with some record weeks of debt issuance. In Q3, we continue to add regional investment bankers with a focus on expanding our geographic coverage in the U.S. to match our coverage model and market leadership and commercial banking across the U.S. One of the reasons for growth in deposits and Global Banking has been our consistent investment over multiple years and digital capabilities within our transaction services platform. Referring to Slide 19, note the growth in mobile and digital usage at the top of the page, and our focus on solutions for clients on the bottom of the page. Treasurers are looking for the same type of convenience as consumers and our consumer and commercial teams work closely together to leverage technology advancements and drive usage and adoption of mobile and digital solutions. We now have over 500,000 CashPro users and mobile CashPro users doubled year-over-year. Mobile payment approvals by these users were $144 billion over the past 12 months, nearly doubling year-over-year. Switching to Global Markets on Slide 20. As I usually do, I will talk about the results excluding DVA. Global Markets produced $858 million in earnings. When comparing to results year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter, note that both prior periods included similar size equity investment gains that were noted in previous earnings calls. And in both cases, these gains were not included in sales and trading results. Year-over-year revenue was down 2% as the segment share of improved investment banking fees and the modest improvement in sales and trading did not offset the prior year\u2019s gain on an equity investment. Sales and trading improved 4% year-over-year. FICC was flat with Q3 2018 while equities improved 13%. FICCs revenue showed improved results in mortgage trading and municipal trading, but was weaker in FX and credit products. The improvement in equities to $1.15 billion was driven by growth in client facing activities as well as continued \u2013 as well as we continue to invest in our equity financing products. In 2019, in equities, we added new clients and increased our market share with existing one. Benefits derived from increased scale have improved the efficiency of our balance sheet as well as return metrics. Expenses were up 2% year-over-year as we continue to invest in technology, plus Brexit preparedness continued to add expense. On Slide 21, you can see that our mix of sales and trading revenue remains weighted to domestic activity, where global fee pools are centered. Within FICC, revenue mix remained weighted toward credit products. Finally, on Slide 22, we show all other, which reported a loss of $1.6 billion. Results here included the joint venture, impairment charge. Excluding this charge, the segment would have reported a profit of roughly $100 million. A few other items impacted results here, first provision benefit from the recoveries totaling $200 million related to the sale of primary non-core consumer real estate loans totaling $1.8 billion. Second, the elevated litigation expense Brian mentioned is booked here. And third, the effective tax rate this quarter was 16% and included discrete benefits booked here and related to the resolution of several tax matters. We continue to expect the effective tax rate in Q4 of around 19% excluding unusual items. Okay. With that, let\u2019s just open it up to Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll take our first question from Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead. Jim Mitchell : Hey, good morning, guys. I guess I\u2019ll ask the question and you can decide not to answer, but just if there is any help you can give us on sort of the NII outlook beyond 4Q. I know there\u2019s a lot of moving parts, but given the forward curve and maybe you could also help us think about the premium amortization year-to-date, what that drag has been and how that would play out in a stable rate environment from here. Thanks. Paul Donofrio : Sure. So, let me start with the premium amortization, if \u2013 I\u2019m not going to give you any precise number, but if you think about the extra day we had from Q2 to Q3, the increase in premium amortization in the quarter more than offset that. In terms of, but going forward, unless long-end rates fall meaningfully from here, we wouldn\u2019t expect that level of increase in premium amortization in Q4 even next year without significant increases \u2013 significant decrease among the rates. In terms of the outlook for 2020, obviously that\u2019s going to be highly dependent on future Fed activity and on deposit pricing across the industry. We don\u2019t think it\u2019s really prudent right now to provide specific guidance at this point. You have our thoughts on. Well, I\u2019m sure we\u2019re going to be talking about Q4, and you have our thoughts on that from our prepared remarks. You\u2019re also going to have our asset sensitivity disclosures. So, the only thing I would remind you is, when you think about Q1, we will have one less day of interest which impacts NII by about $80 million, but we\u2019ll get that day back in the third quarter. Jim Mitchell : Right. So maybe just a follow-up on that, just on the balance sheet growth. It seems like both loans and deposits have accelerated a little bit. You indicated some pretty strong trends and sort of new account growth both consumer and wealth. Do you \u2013 and coupled with sort of the lower rate environment, do you see deposit growth picking up across? You had good commercial across the consumer franchise broadly whether it\u2019s wealth or traditional banking. Brian Moynihan : Yeah. I think, we have \u2013 if you go back many quarters ago, we discussed -- our thought process is to tell our teammates to price to achieve sustainable deposit growth of 3% or more faster than the economy, which means you are in axiomatic point there as you\u2019re gaining share at all times if economy is growing less. So, they\u2019ve been doing that. We are staying very careful and disciplined. There were some adjustments made on the wealth management business. If you look back last year, we had some growth there that we slowed down because it was a little too tied to bidding too much rate. They changed that process, they flattened out, now they are growing again. On the commercial side, the changes of interest-bearing and non-interest-bearing and the fees for services and all that stuff, calculations change, but I\u2019d say you should expect us to continue to grow at the rate we\u2019re growing now or faster because frankly, we\u2019ve been very disciplined about how we\u2019ve been driving. It gets core checking accounts on the consumer side, core checking and savings accounts on the wealth management business, and obviously GTS business, and so I\u2019d expect it to continue to grow maybe faster, 3%, 4%, and 5%, but the thing about that is \u2013 that is incredible amounts of new customers at very advantaged price and that we can put to work . Jim Mitchell : That\u2019s great. Thanks. Brian Moynihan : I think one thing. Jim, just, as I said in my prepared remarks, there\u2019s a lot of discussion when the Fed started raising rates, what would happen? And what I said back there was consumer increased their deposit balances by about $145 billion since the first Fed rate increase, and now there has been two decreases, right. So, think about that machine just churning out growth and growth and growth, 75% of that was checking balances. That\u2019s the real encouraging part of the store in consumer. All time customer satisfaction, high in those businesses. All time employee satisfaction high. All time customer growth rates, high for 15 years or so, and you just take that and play it out, it\u2019s pretty important. Jim Mitchell : Yes, it seems like it could be a good leading indicator. Thanks. Operator : Our next question will come from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Mike Mayo : Hi, I\u2019m a little stuck on Slide 7 with the efficiency. And you mentioned all the investing that you\u2019re doing. So, are you willing to go to negative operating leverage or with the investments like, we have the new sales people in the branches and you had more deposit growth. You have new regional banking coverage. You have more investment banking. So, the investments are paying off. So, what\u2019s your confidence in growing revenues faster than expenses over the next year, even though you\u2019re not giving specific guidance, but more generally, what\u2019s the role of technology inside the firm that\u2019s enabling this operating leverage? For example, how many data centers do you have and how many you are going to close? What percent of your applications you expect to migrate to the cloud? Just a little bit more color on what\u2019s happening behind the scenes that enables your operating leverage and your expectations for continuing that. Brian Moynihan : Mike, those are good questions. I think we are going to invest for long-term value of this company and our clients. And so, if this quarter we are sort of flattish on operating leverage, if we happen to go negative I\u2019d argue, and that was the right thing to do based on everything we\u2019re assessing at the time you do it. These quick changes in rates obviously have an impact that you then outgrow with the volumes coming in and producing the value. So, but that takes some compounding for the quarter. So, our attitude in talking to our investors is, if we\u2019re gaining share and doing the right things, keep going. But the real key is back to your \u2013 sort of your second question, which is we are getting the benefits of sustained long-term investment, and the change the way this company operates that continues to push through. And so, three years \u2013 2.5 years ago, we said we\u2019d operate this year on $53 billion and change in expenses, and we hit that number and a lot of you had assumed a $57 billion or something like that. Next year, we told you, we\u2019d be in a low $53 billion as again and we still are sticking to that. And so that\u2019s \u2013 three, four years out, you\u2019re saying how can you plan out with all the investments we\u2019re making. That is because, we know we\u2019re making investments at the same time they are taking out costs. The cloud journey for Bank of America is an interesting one. We started about really the new BAC framework for those of you, remember that, that came out of that into early days as simplified, improved. We had 200,000 plus servers, those server accounts now down to 70,000. The first decision we made was to actually create an internal cloud. Those servers were operating about 30%, 67 data centers, very much dedicated by line of business, by operational unit, by risk or whatever. We took all that away and build common architecture, so the lion share of applications run around 8,000 servers. We still have 70,000 servers, but those are more dedicated for very specific things and we\u2019ll continue to work to take them down, we\u2019re down to 23 data centers. Those who\u2019ve been around the company, I don\u2019t know, we took a $350 million charge a few years in the second quarter of 2017 to pay for part of this changeover. But in that time frame, we\u2019ve reduced expenses by basically around 40%, for $2 billion a year on our backbone. And so at the same time if you looked on Pages 14 and 19 you can see just over the last couple of years the volume of transactions. So we\u2019re up 86% in mobile logins, we\u2019re up 39% in wire transactions and things like that. So what you\u2019ve had is this scale effect that we\u2019ve been able to internalize. In our provision these services from what we can get, and the external cloud is still 25%, 30% cheaper, which we expect to change honestly. And so we are working with potential providers to take the next step, which was discrete data centers and resources to internal cloud, save a ton of money, then use that power to actually negotiate with third parties to how they might help you and support you and that\u2019s going on with Cathy Bessant and her team right now and Howard Boville runs this for us. But so far we\u2019re still cheaper and so far we have to make sure that the external providers are safe sound lead the data just for us to use with our customers don\u2019t make \u2013 people\u2019s data, et cetera. And that discussion negotiation goes on, as we speak, but we will \u2013 we\u2019re not \u2013 we don\u2019t need to own the hardware, we just need to find out who can provide the right way. Mike Mayo : Well. Thanks for providing data that others have not provided yet, so just one follow-up then. Again and the spirit behind this is, you\u2019re getting the operating efficiency, while we\u2019re making investments you\u2019re doing stuff behind the scenes like this. So if you\u2019ve gone from 60 data centers to 23 data centers. How much further you have to go? If you\u2019ve gone from 200,000 servers to 70,000 servers, how much more do you have to go? And what percent of your applications do you expect to migrate to the cloud over time? Brian Moynihan : The last question I\u2019d leave to people more expertise. But Mike in the spirit of constant improvement, I never give people a number that I\u2019m satisfied and you should neither. In other words, if we think where you can \u2013 we\u2019re at X for Howard and the team in this case or any of our businesses, you can improve it every day. And so that is the cultural change we made in this company and frankly the stability of having not had any acquisition activity since 2009 and any other inorganic movement. You can play any things out and execute. Some of these things take three to four years to get done. So you have to be patient, you have to be consistent. You have to keep allocating investment to them to cause a change to happen and be disciplined about the cost coming out the other side. But I\u2019ll never tell people we\u2019re done, because then they\u2019d stop working at it. Mike Mayo : All right, thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Please go ahead. Glenn Schorr : Hi, thanks very much. I\u2019m curious, now that you\u2019ve taken a charge on the merchant servicing JV. I\u2019m curious about the go forward. Like, can you talk a little bit about what is built, what do you want to build? Is there going to be an impact on expenses that we\u2019ll see and how soon we\u2019ll see progress and what we\u2019d see. Just curious to learn more. Brian Moynihan : Sure. Glenn, let me start with a high level comment and then I\u2019ll let Paul, because remember, many of you don\u2019t know \u2013 don\u2019t probably remember that Paul ran GTS for a while and had his part of this portfolio. But he can hit some of the details, but philosophically \u2013 we want to control our destiny to be able to provide this type of service to our clients in a much cleaner way and we had a great partner in FDR. And at some point that was good for what was going on in the world, then it\u2019s changed. So we\u2019re making a change. So, lot of the discussions on in terms of where we take this. The team is working with FDR closely to unwind the venture as per the contract, et cetera, but it\u2019s been a good relationship, expect that to continue in various ways, but on the other hand, we had to get control of our destiny. The sales force of implementation. Paul, I want you to hit some of the pieces in terms of the numbers and sort of impact on expenses and things like that, revenue. Paul Donofrio : Yes. I mean, I guess in terms of expenses, I would remind you that the accounting for BBAMs doesn\u2019t change until, the JV actually ends in June, that\u2019s the first point. And so when you get out to Q3 2020, we\u2019ll begin reporting our share of the revenue and our share of the expenses versus today where we record that share as net earnings in the other income line under the equity accounting method, right. As we sit here today, given all we have to do between now and then, we\u2019re not disclosing specifics, there\u2019s a lot of work to do. And the bottom line impact is really not that impactful. As we get closer to, I think the actual dissolution, we\u2019ll give you some more guidance. Glenn Schorr : Do you have a lot to build in terms of being able to service the clients and deliver everything that you want to deliver to them, everything that you\u2019re doing now, I\u2019m assuming your current partner is doing. So, I\u2019m just curious how much of that you can do behind the scenes as you lead up to June 2020. Paul Donofrio : We\u2019re working on our plans and we have a fair amount to do. But as you think about technology spend and incremental bill costs I would \u2013 that\u2019s going to be prioritized within our normal $3 billion or plus a year that we\u2019re investing. Glenn Schorr : Okay. Brian, maybe one just high level. One on loan growth, I think, growing loans, core loan, 6% and a 2% world like you described would be considered great by most metrics, just curious if you think that\u2019s sustainable, if we\u2019re going to sustain this 2% world. Brian Moynihan : Yes. I think, it will ebb and flow and you\u2019ve seen it over the last, if you look that one page on the low end quarter. It shows you across 6% to 3% to 6% for commercial. So what we\u2019ve been doing, that\u2019s helping drive that, one of the major things we did is, I think if you calculate. We have four segments which go against commercial lending, the Small Business segment, and our consumer business. Business Banking segment, Global Commercial Banking segment, which most be called middle market and in our GCIB for large companies. If you look across those segments, especially in small business, and importantly in Business Banking and Global Commercial Banking, Ather Williams, who runs Business Banking and Alastair Borthwick, those guys have been investing in headcount and people and relationship manager and \u2013 precise number for each of them. But I think 25% more bankers today than there were three years ago, which gave us an opportunity to divide the portfolios of clients further. So people had less clients to get more depth of relationship and that\u2019s why you see statistics about key products per relationship. And then secondly, with the capacity we added to get new relationships all consistent with our credit. So we often get asked you\u2019re growing commercial loans. We\u2019re not \u2013 we always ask ourselves, okay, we\u2019re sticking to our credit standards and we\u2019ve been able to do that. So I think it\u2019s sustainable and mid-single digits, maybe 6% a little higher, maybe 5%, maybe 4%, maybe 6%, if economy is a 2%, but this taking market share, because of the deployment of the capabilities into the middle market and business banking franchise is along with some of the work that\u2019s going on now with investment banking and others is a good place to be. And it\u2019s a three or four year investment, it takes about three years to get a commercial banker coming into our franchise up to speed, honestly. And then on top of that, there is a fellow named Robert Schleusner who runs a group, the \u2013 who does the underwriting process for the whole enterprise behind all these businesses and we\u2019ve invested tremendously in the technology and the support of that Group for their underwriting capabilities turnaround time all the things and that is allowing us to frankly have \u2013 we\u2019re told the fastest turnaround time of the banks, large, small or bigger or smaller. And so, we feel, that we\u2019re creating the kind of competitive advantage that this franchise has embedded. Glenn Schorr : Awesome. Thank you, Brian. Operator : Our next question will come from John McDonald with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead. John McDonald : Hi. Wanted to follow-up on Jim\u2019s questions around NII. Paul, you mentioned the full year outlook for the 1% hasn\u2019t changed. The prior year outlook for the fourth quarter was to be around $12 billion. You came in a little bit higher this quarter. Just as we think about jumping off point into next year, are you still thinking about a fourth quarter NII around that $12 billion. Is that a fair reading of your disclosures and things like that? Paul Donofrio : Yes, that\u2019s a fair reading. John McDonald : Okay. And then just could you remind us how to read those disclosures and think about the impact of another Fed cut from here? There are some differences to the 10-Q disclosure you mentioned prior, like it\u2019s only the banking book, it\u2019s relative to the forward curve, how should we needle that and think about what one rate cut, if we\u2019re going to model that going forward. Paul Donofrio : Sure. So you\u2019ll have our sensitivity disclosures in our normal filings. But when you look at them, you\u2019re going to see that, over the next \u2013 but if the Fed were to cut rates by 25 basis points. And remember that disclosure is beyond the forward curve, which has three rate cuts in it, right? But if you look at that disclosure, you will see that full 100 basis points would equate to around $3.3 billion on the short end, you just divide by 16, and you\u2019re going to get the impact on quarterly basis of about $200 million. But it\u2019s going to be a little bit less of that, because again that forward curve includes three rate cuts and then you\u2019re talking about 100 basis points on top of that. So you\u2019d literally be \u2013 that forward curve is literally, I mean that sensitivity disclosure literally means should be at zero interest rates. And obviously the next rate cut, we\u2019re not going to be at zero interest rates. So it\u2019s not going to be the full $200 million when you do the math on that disclosure. In addition, as you point out or alluded to, that\u2019s just our banking book. And if you include Global Markets, which is modestly liability sensitive that decline would be even further mitigated. John McDonald : Okay. So something I think you said maybe before $125 million to $175 million or something less than $200 million. Paul Donofrio : Yes. It\u2019s going to be less than $200 million and I\u2019d even tell you it\u2019s going to be meaningfully less than $200 million. Brian Moynihan : John, these things \u2013 I know, you guys would like us to round it out to six digit each time and give it to you for next years. But the reality is, we gave you an estimate for this quarter, last quarter, I mean, fourth quarter \u2013 the current quarter and we gave it to you last quarter. And in fact, there has been more rate cuts and we\u2019re still holding the same guidance of $12 billion in change and stats shows you that we\u2019re managing the heck to try to avoid some of these impacts and how we\u2019d price deposits and better growth in deposits when you may have estimated that. So there\u2019s a lot of estimation, but we\u2019re trying to give is, dramatically as Paul has talked about it over time, but it\u2019s \u2013 there is a \u2013 it\u2019s not, it\u2019s in precise, there\u2019s just a lot of moving parts that frankly we\u2019ve managed better than we thought we could. John McDonald : I totally get it. And that\u2019s totally appreciated, Brian. Just with that, one more nitpick Paul, just from the third to the fourth quarter $12.3 billion this quarter. The pressure is that you have in the fourth is kind of the combination of the LIBOR. And then also the premium amort, is that why you could come down a little more than $200 million in the fourth quarter and again subject to all the caveats. Paul Donofrio : Look, as you\u2019re thinking about the second quarter to the third quarter, remember, we had one extra day. We had a second rate cut that came at the end of the quarter. So as we sit here today, we don\u2019t have that extra day, you\u2019ve got two rate cuts fully baked in that are going to affect asset yields. Plus, you\u2019ve got in that forward curve, so everything we\u2019re talking about here as soon as the forward curve. You\u2019ve got another rate cut. I already told you that, I thought that the premium amort would not be as significant anywhere near as significant as it was second quarter and the third quarter. We\u2019re going to have loan and deposit growth. We\u2019re going to have \u2013 we\u2019re going to, again, as Brian just said work hard on all the other levers we have like deposit pricing. And so you get to, I\u2019m not giving you guidance I gave you, kind of how to think about it based upon those sensitivity disclosures. But that\u2019s why it\u2019s a little bit different going from 3Q to 4Q versus Q2 to 3Q. John McDonald : Okay, great. Thanks. Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Brian Moynihan : Good morning, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good morning. The question that we get, with everybody we speak with is around how you\u2019re thinking about the competition in retail brokerage, with some of the e-brokers obviously going to zero commission on cash and options and different players, different price points there on different products, but just wanted to understand, how you think about that? I realize it\u2019s a small piece of the revenue line you\u2019ve got, but just want to see if you think that this is at all, something that you need to address in the marketplace? Brian Moynihan : So, Betsy, let me take that. Because if you remember, right? I had that business when we introduced $0 commissions in 2006, so it\u2019s not a new concept of Bank of America. And so, about 87% of the current commission \u2013 current trades are $0 in the area of that \u2013 in the Merrill Edge and the self-directed platform that\u2019s been true forever. So this is not a change to our operating strategy, but we don\u2019t focus on trying to drive a pure trading type of thing. We think about the relationship in the Merrill Edge and things like that. So if you look at the consumer investment assets on Page 13, you can see, they\u2019re up $20 billion year-over-year. We\u2019re driving a whole relationship into these managed portfolios that\u2019s based on financial advice to that. Yet, we still have a very confident, capable, I guess some doubtful competition. We have a very strong platform that grows also but if $0 change won\u2019t affect as much larger, because we frankly introduced it 13 years ago. Betsy Graseck : Right, that\u2019s with preferred accounts. And so when people look at Page 16 and they see the brokerage rev line there, it\u2019s like $700 million this quarter. That is really commissioned on other things than stocks and options. Is that a fair way to read it? Brian Moynihan : That\u2019s really not relevant here, because that\u2019s in the wealth management business, where this stuff shows up is actually back in the consumer side, because Merrill Edge is in that area and that\u2019s where the lion\u2019s share of this is. So it\u2019s not \u2013 that $700 million is. The financial advisory team under Andy selling things that closed end funds, mini bonds, stocks and a lot of other things. So if that \u2013 that\u2019s under pressure for years. And as you will know and so that\u2019s a constant change of fighting the average yield for the total client assets in that business, but that\u2019s not affected by this decision. Betsy Graseck : Got it. Brian Moynihan : And you will see us push a little bit on some of the qualification for to open up this capability and another set of clients, but we only have 13% less to go, so. Betsy Graseck : Got it. Okay. And then just separately, one more question on NII, Paul, if you don\u2019t mind, but in the quarter, the markets NII helped out this quarter. I believe and just let me know if I\u2019m reading that right. Paul Donofrio : Yes, yes, you\u2019re reading right. Market\u2019s NII went up this quarter. And we\u2019ve said that the markets business is liability sensitive. So it does help NII, if rates decline. I just would point out that we really manage that business looking at total sales and trading revenue not NII. And although the trading book is liability sensitive, it is really important to remember that client activity and product mix in Global Markets can vary quarter-over-quarter. And we\u2019ll drive sort of income statement geography, which can produce an increase as you saw this quarter, NII or maybe reduced NII in another quarter, with the offset is going to be in trading account profits. So that\u2019s why the real key here is to focus on the sales and trading disclosures as opposed to the mix between NII and trading account profits. Betsy Graseck : Got it. Okay, thank you. Brian Moynihan : Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Saul Martinez with UBS. Please go ahead. Saul Martinez : Hey, good morning, guys. I\u2019ll also ask a question on NII. The one \u2013 it seems like obviously third quarter is a little bit better than maybe expected and you\u2019re retaining the 1% growth in kind of implies, $12 billion for the fourth quarter. You obviously have had rates come in, long-end to come in forward curves pricing and at least two more rate cut. But it also feels like, maybe you\u2019re a little bit more optimistic than about the NII trajectory than you were maybe earlier this quarter. Is that a fair reading, Paul? And if so, I mean, what makes you a little bit more optimistic about your ability to sustain NII? Is it just that loan growth is coming in better you\u2019ve been able to reprice deposits a little bit faster? What gives you a little bit \u2013 what makes you a little bit more confident that your NII trajectory could be a little bit better than what you thought, maybe even a couple of months ago? Paul Donofrio : I think we do feel good. And I think we feel that way, because we\u2019ve seen how our teams are performing in a different interest rate environment. We\u2019ve seen how teams and our clients by the way, have reacted to appropriate adjustments on deposit pricing, given the change in LIBOR. You got to remember all of our clients are getting a huge benefit and what their paying on their loans. So it\u2019s appropriate to adjust deposit pricing. I think we\u2019re obviously growing loans and deposits well. We\u2019ve deepen relationships and we\u2019ve improved our capability to service some of both the loan deposit side. So I think it\u2019s just another quarter under our belt where rates were different. And we\u2019ve seen how the teams have performed and we\u2019re feeling good. Saul Martinez : Okay. No, that\u2019s helpful. And on the deposit cost side, you did \u2013 I mean obviously, interest bearing deposit costs were down 5 basis points, and it seems like that\u2019s going to be given the limited scope in retail, wealth and commercial, you\u2019re being proactive there as you should, but you\u2019re coming from a lower starting point on deposit cost the most of your competitors to begin with. So I mean, just can you just talk to how much more room you feel like you have as we get further along in the rate cycle? How difficult does it become or does it become more difficult to be more proactive in terms of lowering your deposit costs? Brian Moynihan : I think back to the \u2013 in the earlier discussion, that sort of general guidance we give our teams is you have to get us 3% in the current economic environment. We want to see 3% in core growth and deposits, and you have to then price to achieve that both. And then also at the same time achieve your goals on NII and things like that. So I think we try to be consistent. We value relationships. We focus on the core. On the commercial side the GTS relationships drive the economics in the business, as you well know. On the wealth management side, we\u2019re driving not only the investment cash, but all the transactional cash and you have to think of those as two separate executions and putting teammates investing by putting teammates into the Merrill Lynch offices who can help the client associates and others who have always done a good job, doing better job of getting core checking relationships and mortgages and things like that, which will help. And then on a consumer side, obviously, it\u2019s just the power of the brand and the franchise and digital competency. So but we don\u2019t let people off the hook either way, and I \u2013 that\u2019s said, we want them to grow, we want them to grow with the right kind of pricing that, somebody comes in and says I can grow by issuing a bunch of term CDs and premium price, we say that\u2019s kind of interesting, but that doesn\u2019t qualify for what we want. So and that then if you look at it by business you\u2019re seeing, leave aside the movements as rates moved up and following you\u2019re seeing as you stabilize and even come down little bit, you\u2019re seeing able to, continue to grow and managing rate paid carefully. Saul Martinez : And should we expect non-interest bearing deposits to grow disproportionately in this environment? It seems with lower rate, it seems like higher yielding CDs become less attractive, and this is a \u2013 for a bank like you, to National Bank and this great franchise and the national franchise, it seems like a pretty attractive environment or good environment for you guys to take share and suck up demand deposits at maybe a faster rate than some of your peers. Brian Moynihan : I think, yes, we expect to grow at a faster rate than our peers. That\u2019s kind of axiomatic when you\u2019re gaining the shares for this. But if you look at the \u2013 if you look at the slides on the deposits, you can see that growth in consumer drives the equation on the non-interest bearing and very low interest cost deposits. And we\u2019re seeing there, Dean and the team have a good job of \u2013 they\u2019ve gone from 6 basis points to 11 basis points. That\u2019s due to mix. It\u2019s \u2013 and as Paul said earlier, we are liability insensitive to some degree, because we have got the mix of deposits. And but you\u2019ve got to remember on the $700 billion, 11 basis points, $700 million some a year of cost, there\u2019s only so much leverage in there. So we say, just keep growing and grow in the right categories. Yes. They have CDs and the CDs grew year-over-year. Paul Donofrio : The only thing I\u2019ll add there is \u2013 I think you all know this, but if interest rates are lower than deposit rate paid is less important relative to all the other things people reasons why people invest with us or I should say deposit with us. So theoretically, you might see more deposit growth in a lower interest rate environment, because trust is more important. The deep relationship they have with us across preferred rewards and other things we do for them. We can be mobile. The online capability, the nationwide network of financial centers, our global GTS capabilities, those just all become more valuable to customers if rates are lower. Saul Martinez : Great. Thanks so much. Operator : Our next question will come from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Ken Usdin : Hey guys, just a quick one, Brian, you mentioned that obviously delivering positive operating leverage gets harder with their \u2013 and rate environment where it is, but as you look ahead and you\u2019ve done this good job of keeping this $53 billion or so, what are the incremental things that become more productive underneath that allows you to fund the incremental investments, like do we transition to other parts of the business becoming more productive or other pieces that you haven\u2019t \u2013 maybe still haven\u2019t yet attacked that could still provide that underlying support. Thanks. Brian Moynihan : Sure. I mean we have the operational excellence platform, which that only Tom Scribner had. Now he\u2019s moved over to work on part of the operations group under Cathy. But Ann Walker has \u2013 she had simplified and improved. This is an ongoing program, which has literally every manager in the company that are couple of levels down from my team constantly working on coming up with the mapping of the process, improving our processes and asking for investment to help improve those processes. So there are areas where we\u2019re very digitize and very, no paper and very electronic and you can think of that in some of consumer, there\u2019s areas where we\u2019re still just now getting the benefits of major investments. You may think about the underwriting area and commercial I talked about earlier that we\u2019re now bringing the people the teammates onto the platform to drive it. And so all our platforms have major improvements available to \u2013 even though we\u2019re very efficient and our efficiency ratio in each of the business units are industry-leading part from our scale and part from just the discipline of the teammates. So and we look at deployment of the relationship management town. Are we getting the calls and the clients from our visits and the productivity out of that? We\u2019re looking at \u2013 we continue to work on a real estate configurations that were down 50 million square feet real estate from the start of 2010, and yet we don\u2019t satisfy with ourselves in the occupancy rates. Can we push it up? Can we densify the space? The new building we\u2019ve build, New York will be also this new modern style of work environment that allow us to make economic, higher rental costs. If \u2013 hence you look at every aspect of the company and continue to look at managers, we\u2019re down 10,000 managers over the last three or four years that could continue to drift down as we continue to look at what a manager does and how we test that. We let attrition work for us and but not hiring and making sure when planning for on higher and we can drive it out. And so everybody wants to say, what\u2019s the silver bullet, the answer is everywhere, there\u2019s opportunities and we don\u2019t know how far these goes with machine learning, our efficient dollars. These things you hear about are still in their infancy of being applied. And by the way, we spent $1.5 billion in data, work over the last five, six years. You\u2019re largely around all the CCAR stuff, but ultimately in some of the work we are doing, but really to get all the data rates actually the parts and things that can operate are operating on good data and that investment then allows us to take advantage of it and we\u2019re still in the early days, quotes that we invested in the markets business, so it\u2019s from one side of the company, the other. And going to the earlier comment, what target do you have? The answer is, we don\u2019t have a target except to improve every month, day, the day, month, week and quarter, and we\u2019ll continue to do that. Ken Usdin : Thanks a lot, Brian. Operator : Our next question will come from Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead. Brian Kleinhanzl : Yes, thanks. I just \u2013 two quick questions here. On the Wealth and Investment Management, I heard that you were bringing down the non-interest expense. Can you get into a little bit more detail, if there is still more that can be done on expenses in there, I mean \u2013 the positive operating leverage with expenses down. Brian Moynihan : Yes. It\u2019s \u2013 we have the pre-tax margin if you think about it, once you pay the talent team mates we have and the financial advisory platform and the private banking platform. You\u2019re working on about half the revenue and we\u2019re getting 30% of that \u2013 to the pre-tax line. So the idea is, you got to improve all directions, it\u2019s not just expenses and its efficiency expense, simplification of product, especially for the \u2013 for the clients, with $500,000, $600,000 to continue to add straightforward products that are digitized on both the way they are delivered and the way they\u2019re statement and everything. And then making the advisors able to handle more clients and that allows us get more efficiency, real estate configuration. There is a lot of papers still in this business just because the history of it, so they\u2019re probably in the first inning of really, it\u2019s a very digital business in some ways when you think about trades and how they go through, but it\u2019s a very paper intensive business in other ways. The way we do AML, KYC refreshes \u2013 we\u2019re going to recognize the team that took a several 100,000 hours out of, several 1,000 hours out of the work to do that, it\u2019s just a 1,000 things. And so, but importantly also by driving the growth in loans and deposits and stuff that is less, creates more pre-tax profit margin frankly off the strength of the bank\u2019s balance sheet in the size of our company and that gives us unique positioning. So we\u2019re running the industry leading margins. And we know we can continue to push them up. It is a very slow thing and we \u2013 we don\u2019t change the way we pay people. We really focus in on you\u2019re working around and making our team mates ability. Have a great career make more money and sort of the clients better while we keep making the place, more efficient. Brian Kleinhanzl : And then a separate one for the U.S cards, I mean, I think you saw the gross interest yield, still pick up in the quarter despite the breakup and change in prime rates there, was there something unique going on. It allows you to kind of expand yields and by the way, if\u2026 Brian Moynihan : The card portfolio, right. Brian Kleinhanzl : Correct. Card portfolio. Paul Donofrio : Yes. Look, we\u2019ve been focused on profitability. We have been careful about growth as we\u2019re growing. We\u2019re adding 1 million new cards a year and again with the focus on profitability. So we\u2019ve reduced we\u2019ve sort of scale back on people we think are trying to game the system or just going after promotions. So that\u2019s improving the profitability overall. I think you saw that in the RAM that you\u2019re referencing, which is up year-over-year and that\u2019s mostly being driven by NII. I mean NIM growth in the card. Brian Kleinhanzl : Great. Thanks. Operator : Our next question will come from Matt O\u2019Connor from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Brian Moynihan : Hey, Matt. Matt O\u2019Connor: Good morning. If you look at your expenses, ex the impairment and the legal cost is about $12.7 billion. Obviously if you annualize that it\u2019s below the $53 billion. You\u2019re talking about next year and I know there\u2019s some seasonality in the first half of the year that drives cost higher, but I guess, first, is there anything in the $12.7 billion, that\u2019s kind of not are not sustainable or unusual and why isn\u2019t there may be some downward flexibility to $53 billion. Brian Moynihan : You mean, benefit. You\u2019re saying... Matt O\u2019Connor: Correct. Correct. Brian Moynihan : Yes, I think it\u2019s just \u2013 the third quarter was just a little bit of timing. We\u2019re increasing our investment in people in financial centers, in marketing, but it\u2019s not even throughout the whole year. So you got to think about the guidance we\u2019ve given for the full year as opposed to just any given quarter. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay. So just some ebbing and flowing there? Paul Donofrio : Yes. Just ebbing and flowing on marketing and other areas, which will rebound investments we expect some of that to rebound in the fourth quarter. Brian Moynihan : And Matt, that\u2019s why, if you go back to that earlier page in the deck, why we should. If you think about the last couple of years, there\u2019s always ebbing and flowing. But we\u2019re showing that we\u2019re kind of holding it here. And as you look over the next couple of years, we think we can hold it here, and then at some point, we\u2019ll start growing. And we\u2019re trying to grow the we\u2019re trying to spend 3% more year but only grow the expense base 1% kind of long-term picture. We\u2019re trying to take maybe 1% to 2% and with revenue growth of 3% to 4% in a normal environment that was great operating leverage and EPS growth, that\u2019s the long-term view that we keep holding to. When interest rates move quickly in a quarter, those are things that deal with it, but over time, that\u2019s what you\u2019re trying to achieve. And so, you could take that is where the general operating principles we push our teams toward. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay. And then just separately, you talked about deposit growth potentially, 4% or 5% accelerating little bit from where we\u2019re at right here, and then you talked about loan growth potentially being in the, call it 4% to 6% range. As you think about the overall balance sheet should that grow in line with deposits or are there some opportunities to bring down debt and you\u2019ll see a little bit less earning asset growth? Paul Donofrio : Yes. Look on the specific point, there are opportunities to bring down debt. There is a little bit of opportunity there. Our TLAC ratios are probably little bit higher than we want them to be. But that was because we were adding a new bank in Dublin, adding a new broker dealer in Paris, and by the way, putting up our broker dealer here in the U.S for resolution planning. So we have a little bit of opportunity there. I wouldn\u2019t make too much of a big deal about that. Basically our balance sheet is going to grow as we grow deposits with all that deposit growth going into loan growth, we still have the non-core portfolio running off a little bit. And whatever doesn\u2019t go to loans is going to go into the securities portfolio. Brian Moynihan : And then you have the markets business, which also because of the financing activities and equities, not a lot of risk, but notional growth of balance sheet that you\u2019ve seen. Matt O\u2019Connor: Yes. Okay, thank you. Operator : And we will take our last question from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Hi, Brian. Brian Moynihan : Hey, Gerard. How are you? Gerard Cassidy : Good. Firstly, I just wanted to thank you and Bank of America for the continued support of the Bank Analysts Association meeting. You guys do that every year like you\u2019re doing this year. So thank you very much. We really appreciate that. The second point, credit is very good for you folks in the industry. Can you share with us, when you look out over the next cycle, where are you guys spending extra time today just making sure that you don\u2019t take your eye off the ball because some potential problems that could be on the horizon. Brian Moynihan : So, Gerard, you asked the question, Paul and I, and Geoff Greener, our Chief Risk Officer. And importantly, our Enterprise Risk Committee led by Frank Bramble, our Board of Directors. If we keep saying, how do we make sure that we\u2019re sticking it through our knitting, so to speak, and you do that by you see all this goes industry \u2013 industry limits, country limits, leveraged underwriting limits. You pick just limit after limits house guidelines exception. So I think one of the things I think my peers and I would say is, with stress testing and other things you\u2019re required to think of the worst of times in whole capital forward. So I think in the industry generally, that has had a good, a great impact in terms of us all thinking through the long-term impacts, but importantly, the data and the capabilities that we built starting 10, 12 years ago, are just tremendous. So when we asked the question, we can actually see in very discrete areas, whereas our exposure to this or that. The other thing and that\u2019s important because then you can manage at that level. And team under Geoff has done a great job of sort of bringing that data to four and making sure we\u2019re always watching all the different pieces. So, Mick Ankrom, who is in charge of credit risk of the company. I called him up after the Houston hurricanes, couple of years ago. I said, Mick what\u2019s our exposure. So what zip code you want it for and which product, do you want it for? You want the card versus mortgage of people at both. In all \u2013 just as this is Saturday night or something like that, not to say he doesn\u2019t have more fun things to do, but it\u2019s. So I think that allows us to keep track of it, but it\u2019s just all those limits and this granular limits. And then the intrusion of underwriting profit requires, really for any reasonably sized loan, a risk manager to specifically sign off along with a banker on the commercial side and consumer side, the parameters of the buy box of so-called, set by \u2013 with risk and joined there. And that\u2019s, it\u2019s kind of beaten in the system, it\u2019s not something we \u2013 people argue about or think about. So, our real estate exposure is limited by limit that you, tomorrow presents and as ahead of the real estate exposure for the whole company and from the line side and supported by the team on the risk side. So it\u2019s just 30 years I\u2019ve been around this business you just see the granular \u2013 where we used to say, what do we have, the people have to run outlook. Now you have it. And then you can manage a lot more effectively on a go-forward basis. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And then pivoting a bit you touched on it in your prepared remarks about the regional bankers that you guys have been hiring here in the States. Tom talked about it at a conference recently. You had good numbers in your investment banking area this quarter and are taking some wallet share. Is it because of hires that you\u2019re making across the globe or is it because some of your competitors are still struggling to really get back into the whole group of what they were let\u2019s say 10 or 12 years ago? Brian Moynihan : Yes. I think that Matthew Koder and the team have just realized, we had the capabilities of the franchise tools. We just needed to really drive the calling effort and he has done a great job of doing that. Alastair Borthwick and Matthew together have been working on building out this middle-market team, which is good. It\u2019s not only just pure investment banking everything\u2019s M&A or maybe debt capital markets. And also the exposure plays into a lot into the markets business, hedging fuel cost or hedging interest rate risk or currency risk. The average mid-sized U.S. company is engaging all over the world. And that\u2019s a competitive advantage. Only a few of us have us to be able to deliver in. India for a mid-sized company, United States and help them, think through that or other places. So I think the team has done a good job there. We work very closely with a wealth management team in terms of referrals and coverage of the entrepreneurs segment thinking of a private bank or a financial advisor Merrill Lynch and their clients working with the commercial that we measure that we would goal it. Has to come sort of naturally by money motion of transactional activity but the awareness of the capabilities in the coverage is they\u2019ve done a good job. And so we will always be susceptible of the biggest deals of that activity slows down. All of us have that issue, but that underlying middle market just a lot more companies 10,000, 5,000 companies that you can get out that there\u2019s just a lot higher probability of one I\u2019m doing something on a given day than the top 1,000 companies. Gerard Cassidy : No, very good. Thank you. And look forward to seeing you in three weeks. Thank you. Brian Moynihan : Okay. Thanks, Gerard. Operator : And there are no further questions at this time, so I will turn it back to Brian. Brian Moynihan : Thank you very much for your time and attention. And thank you for attending our earnings call. I think the themes for this call, and you heard them in the Q&A in earlier presentations are the years of investments that the team has made and managed are paying off. We\u2019re using loans. Our loan and deposit growth, above industry averages and above the market on a conservatively responsible growth basis continues to help offset the NII pressure due to rate changes which is \u2013 which all of you are focused on, it should be. We still continue to make sure we stay dedicated responsible growth to make sure that the credit risk and market risk we take on is consistent with how you expect us to manage it. And we continue to manage investments and expenses and run that sort of \u2013 do a brain size of saying we can grow our investments and we can also continue to manage our expenses carefully and relatively flat. And then on top of all that. Over the last few years, our ability to have sustainable predictable earnings in excess capital is coming back to you, along with 100% of the earnings at levels which are unprecedented among our peers. So that\u2019s helping drive down the share count and help produce EPS growth that we need. So consistent with responsible growth and we look forward to seeing you next time. Operator : This does conclude today\u2019s program. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Later, you will have the opportunity to ask questions during the question-and-answer session. Please note this call maybe recorded. [Operator Instructions]It is now my pleasure to turn today's conference over to Lee McEntire. Please go ahead. Lee McEntire : Good morning. Thank you, Katherine. Thanks for joining the call to review our fourth quarter 2019 and our full-year results. By now, I hope everyone's had a chance to review the earnings release documents, which are available on the Investor Relations section of bankofamerica.com website.Before I turn the call over to our CEO, Brian Moynihan, for a few remarks, let me remind you that we may make forward-looking statements during the call. For further information on those forward-looking comments, please refer to either our earnings release documents, our website or our SEC filings. After Brian's comments, our CFO, Paul Donofrio, will review more details on the 4Q results. We'll then open up for questions. Please try to limit your questions, so that we can get to all callers.So let's get rolling. Brian? Brian Moynihan : Thank you, Lee. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to review our results. I'm going to let Paul take you through the fourth quarter, which reflected a strong finish to close out 2019. Before that, I want to give you a high level view on our results.Of course, our results continue to reflect the strength of the U.S. consumer in the biggest economy in the world. We continue to be well-positioned here in driving market share gains with great service and capabilities. This quarter is also one of transition from a period of rising rates in 2018 to one that is moving through the impact of the declining rates in the second half of 2019.How do you run a company, a big bank, and deal with lower rates? Well, we drive what we can control with our sempiternal commitment to responsible growth. We drive more loans, more deposits, more assets under management, and driving growth for the right pricing and at the right risks.We also have to manage our cost base carefully, while making the required investments, and we have to take advantage of a strong balance sheet to provide good capital return to our shareholders.At Bank of America, we checked the box on all of these in the quarter. We grew average loans by 6% in our lines of businesses. We grew the deposits by 5% with very disciplined deposit pricing. Our expenses were relatively flat again while we increased investments across our whole company.And in doing that, we earned $7 billion after tax this quarter with a return on tangible common equity of 15.4%. And due to our strong balance sheet, we returned $9.1 billion of capital to our common shareholders this quarter. At the same time, we deployed capital to support growth for our clients, committees and teammates.Let's start on Slide 2. I am referring to the full-year results excluding our third quarter 2019 joint venture impairment charge. We generated $29 billion net income in 2019, a record for our company. That was 3% better than the prior year's results. We are also able to reduce shares by 9%, driving earnings per share up by 12% for 2019. These results were driven by execution on all the pillars of responsible growth.We grew by serving our clients well and improved our market share across the board. We remain disciplined in our risk and our client selection framework. And by the way, our results are more sustainable, as our focus on operational excellence led to a 58% efficiency ratio in 2019, while making the investments we need to make.Our return on equity was 11% for the year and our return on tangible common equity was 15.8% for the year. Record earnings allowed us to invest in our client capabilities, invest in our people and invest in our communities, all while holding the expenses in check.Take a look at Slide 3, you can see the investments we made across all our constituencies. And at the same time, we delivered strong returns for our shareholders. To deliver for our clients, we continued our investment in talent. In 2019, we grew the company by 3,600 teammates. Overall, we hired 32,000 teammates in 2019, including 6,300 new employees from low and moderate-income neighborhoods, 4,000 college and MBA graduates, and we also completed our five-year goal to hire 10,000 military veterans into our company.We completed more than $3 billion in new technology code initiatives last year, building on years of investments in award-winning digital and mobile capabilities to serve our clients better and help our teammates to be more efficient. Most importantly, these investments are bearing fruit as you can see in our customer usage numbers that Paul will talk about.Just a simple example, we surpassed 10 million clients using Erica, our industry-leading consumer AI agent. We introduced Erica about 18 months ago, and now it's starting to reap the scale benefits. Erica is an example of billions of dollars of scaled innovation fueled by our work on operational excellence. These savings generated by operational excellence also enable us to make capital investments in our company of $1.7 billion during 2019 for newer modernized facilities and other related priorities. And in the past three years, we've built 207 new financial centers and modernized more than 1,300.For our employees, we will start at $20 per hour minimum starting pay beginning in March. The cost of all these enhancements, importantly, are in our run rate of expenses, providing the capacity to keep investing in the future without increasing expenses.Also for 2019, for the third consecutive year, we shared our financial success with our teammates with special compensation awards to approximately 95% of them, Three years of special compensation awards totaled over $1.6 billion in compensation addition to all other bonuses and merit and everything else, allowing our teammates to do more with their families.Last year, we also delivered more than $5 billion of community development financing for affordable housing and other important local priorities. We made more than $250 million of philanthropic contribution to help drive economic mobility, including workforce training and development and many other local priorities, where we help to make a difference.We also completed our 10-year $125 billion environmental business initiative goal in 2019. We made that commitment four years ago and it was a 10-year commitment, and we completed six years early. That's why this year we set a new goal of $300 billion environmental initiatives across the next decade.It was a strong year for our company and our team capping our first decade. But here at Bank of America we have a saying, nice start. We know we can do so much more in the future.So on Slide 4, I want to talk about the line of business results. The team's hard work has created a strong improvement in earnings across the board in our lines of business. Dean Athanasia and the consumer team generated impressive $13 billion in after tax earnings in our consumer and small business group by driving responsible growth.They continue to provide real value for clients through innovative products and services, while driving improvements in upgraded facilities, entering new markets and driving innovation. Consumers record level efficiency and customer satisfaction scores reflect our hard work done the right way.Andy Sieg and Katy Knox together run our Global Wealth and Investment Management businesses. They drove net new household growth in 2019 and more integration across those businesses with the rest of the franchise.Merrill Lynch alone brought in more than 40,000 net new affluent households during 2019. Margins in that business remain near the record levels. We generated $1 billion plus in quarterly earnings in the quarters of 2019 and topped this quarter $3 trillion in client balances for the first time.Tom Montag and his team across Global Banking and Global Markets franchises are running one of the biggest commercial lending business in the world, and we\u2019re the top market making investment banking platforms. This powerful combination of Global Banking, Global Markets generated $11.6 billion in after tax net income this year. The team continues to get its fair share of the fee pools across the globe and became the more important partners for many of the world's largest clients.With a renewed focus, our investment banking team regained some of the lost market share from a couple of years ago, and Paul will give you those numbers later. Matthew Koder and team have done a great job in doing this.In addition, that team across the board continues to drive innovation, our global treasury services platform. Paul is going to show you some of those capabilities in the slides later. All these business accomplishments across all these businesses while driving relatively flat costs.Let's move to trends on Slide 5. Our strong balance sheet and strong earnings have driven a corresponding strong increase in our return of capital. We have now dropped below 9 billion shares outstanding, 9.1 billion shares on a fully diluted basis as shown here on the left side of the page. In total, we reduced the share count by nearly 2.5 billion shares from its peak a few years ago.As we look into 2020, Paul will give you some specific guidance on the company's view of what we see at our outlook, but for more general guidance, our research team, our award winning research team sees more generally the U.S. GDP growth at just below 2%, and a global GDP growth just above 3%.We at Bank of America have seen our consumer business a substantial amount of activity. In our consumer business, we see that our customers are coming off a strong finish in 2019 in their spending activity. In addition, there is good loan demand. This results from good employment levels and growing wages. At Bank of America spending by our consumers grew at 5.9% over $3 trillion in spending from 2019 over 2018.We saw solid loan demand in our commercial client base throughout the year, but that moderated in the second half of the year as worries about global economic uncertainty and all the issues that are talked about every day dragged on. Today, we see some resolution to those issues and that combined with continued consumer strength, leads us to expect to see businesses continue their solid activity, and we're hearing more optimism. All this provides a great backdrop to drive responsible growth and continue to deliver for you.With that, I'll turn it over to Paul. Paul Donofrio : Thanks Brian. Good morning, everyone. You can see the summary of our Q4 results on Slide 6, and I'm going to begin on Slide 7.In the fourth quarter, we reported $7 billion in net income and $0.74 in EPS. EPS increased 6% from Q4 2018 reflecting modestly lower earnings more than offset by a 9% reduction in average diluted shares. Returns remained strong in Q4, but the return on assets of 113 basis points and a return on tangible common equity of 15%, well above the company's cost of capital. Our results were driven by our team's focus and solid progress on managing what we can control and gaining market share in an economy that grew at a low single-digit pace.In Q4, we again stayed focused on what we can control. Client activity remained solid, allowing the benefits of loan and deposit growth to aid in offsetting the negative impact of lower short-term rates over the past three quarters. We also continue to see healthy consumer trends in spending and asset quality. Lastly, we experienced a nice rebound in FICC trading from a more negative environment a year ago.So having set the stage, let's turn to the detail starting with the balance sheet on Slide 8. Overall compared to the end of Q3, the balance sheet was relatively flat at $2.4 trillion as growth of both loans and securities was modestly offset by lower Global Market assets. Deposits grew $42 billion, and were first deployed to fund $11 billion of loan growth, with most of the excess funding the growth in debt securities. Liquidity improved, as the average Global Liquidity Sources benefited from deposit growth.Shareholders' equity declined $4 billion, driven mostly by the return of excess capital. In Q4, we returned $9.1 billion in capital through net share repurchases and dividends, which exceeded the $7 billion earned. OCI declined by roughly $1 billion, notable book value per share of $27.32 has improved 9% from Q4 2018.With respect to regulatory metrics, we remain comfortably above our minimum requirements, driven by the return of the excess capital I just reviewed, our CET1 standardized ratio decreased to 11.2%, but remained well above our 9.5% minimum requirement.Our risk weighted assets increased modestly from consumer loan growth and increased Global Banking exposures. Lastly, our TLAC ratio also remained comfortably above our requirements.Looking at how client activity impacted average balances, let's start with deposits on Slide 9. Average deposits grew $65 billion or 5% year-over-year. For 4.5 years now, we have grown deposits on a year-over-year basis every quarter by more than $40 billion.Consumer Banking deposits grew $33 billion or 5%, as we believe customers value the convenience of our financial centers and ATM networks, leading online and mobile capabilities, and our unique preferred reward program. But much of this growth continues to be led by checking balances, which we consider to be the core operational deposits of these customers.Wealth Management deposits grew $8 billion or 3% year-over-year. Global Banking deposits grew $19 billion or 5% year-over-year, and reflected both our strong GTS platform, and the additional bankers we have deployed over the past couple of years.Looking at average loans on Slide 10. You see pretty consistent client activity. Overall average loans of $974 billion were up more than 4% year-over-year. More importantly average loans in our lines of business grew $54 billion or 6% year-over-year, as consumer loans grew 7% and commercial loans grew 6%.As you can see in the bottom right hand chart, we continue to demonstrate a fairly consistent range of responsible growth. Commercial loan growth was broad-based. Loans to middle market clients grew 10%. But I would note, the more stable linked quarter balances here as revolver utilization moved a bit lower.We also saw growth in lending to small businesses growing 7% and within consumer; we saw strong growth of residential mortgages. I would also note the stability of credit card balances, which reflects our decision last year to pull back on less profitable promotional balances, as we continue to prioritize sustainable long-term profitability.Turning to Slide 11 and net interest income. On a GAAP non-FTE basis in Q4, NII was $12.1 billion, $12.3 billion on an FTE basis and was relatively flat compared to Q3 2019. The benefits of loan and deposit growth coupled with disciplined pricing mostly offset the impact across short-term rates of a linked quarter 47 basis point decline in the average Fed funds rate. And while long-term rates were up modestly on a spot basis, on average for the quarter, there was little change.For the full-year of 2019, GAAP NII of $48.9 billion was up 1% despite lower short-term rates. This is consistent with the perspective we had conveyed to you since the middle of the year. We remained disciplined with respect to deposit pricing. In Q4, the rate paid on total interest-bearing deposits of 61 basis points declined 15 basis points.In Consumer Banking, which accounts for more than half of our $1.4 trillion of deposits, customer pricing remained relatively unchanged. On the other hand, in Global Banking and Wealth Management, the decline from Q3 and the rate paid on interest-bearing deposits, was more in line with the 38 basis point drop in average one-month LIBOR.Looking forward, as we move into 2020, let me start by saying, our expectations assume a stable economic and interest rate environment, i.e. flat rates relative to the end of the year.Given those assumptions, we expect NII in Q1 to be lower than Q4, as the benefits of loan and deposit growth will be more than offset by three things. First, with respect to Q1, we will have one less day of interest. Second, we expect lower loan yields to be more fully reflected from the late October Fed rate cut. Third, reinvestment rates are expected to dilute securities yields, despite fractionally higher long-end rates.Moving to Q2, we typically experience seasonally lower NII for two reasons; first, we typically see higher interest expense from funding, increased seasonal Global Markets client activity in equities. The benefit of this activity shows up in non-interest income, instead of interest income. Second, we also typically see lower average card balances, as clients pay down their holiday balances. Both of these seasonal patterns have historically led to lower NII in Q2 compared to Q1.So we would expect NII in the first two quarters of 2020 to be a bit lower than Q4 2019. From there, we would expect NII to rise modestly in the second half of the year, driven by an additional day of interest and continued loan and deposit growth.Turning to Slide 12 and quarterly expenses over the past two years; at $13.2 billion this quarter, expenses were 1% higher than Q4 2018, as increased investments throughout 2019 in people, real estate and technology initiatives were largely offset by savings from operational excellence and lower amortization of intangibles.We have been operating in a tight range for more than two years now, with quarterly expense in the low $13 billion range, and all but one quarter, if you adjust for the 3Q 2019 impairment.So annually, we've been able to maintain a $53 billion expense base, despite increased investments in tech, infrastructure, buildings, people, philanthropy and the other costs that Brian mentioned in the opening of the call.With respect to headcount, year-over-year savings from improved processes and workflows allowed us to fund an increase in the number of sales professionals, as our LOBs added nearly 4,000 associates over the past 12 months.With respect to outlook, our expectations for expense in 2020 haven't really changed from where we provided it in 2016. Despite all the added costs of the higher investments and unknowns like Brexit and others since 2016.We expect our full-year expense to be in the low $53 billion range this year and as long as client activity and the economic environment remains stable, our investment plans will likely remain unchanged.Having said that, I want to provide you with a few reminders with respect to expenses. First, Q1 is expected to include about $400 million of seasonally elevated personnel costs related to payroll taxes, with the remaining quarters of 2020 expected to return to a low $13 billion range.Also, beginning in Q3, the accounting for the BAMS JV is expected to change, following its dissolution. At that time, we will separately record revenue and expense from merchant servicing operations, rather than reflecting our share of the joint venture earnings, as a single amount in other income. This will gross up both expenses and revenue, with little bottom line impact and like we told you in Q3, it's not included in our forward guidance. We will update you, as we move closer to that timeframe.All right; turning to asset quality on Slide 13. Our underwriting standards have been responsible and strong for years now and asset quality trends reflect this, even in this relatively benign credit environment. Total net charge-offs in Q4 were $959 million, compared to $811 million in Q3, when comparing to Q3, remember we sold some loans in Q3, that resulted in recoveries totaling $198 million that reduced net charge-offs.Adjusting for those recoveries, net charge-offs declined $50 million and the net charge-off ratio declined 3 basis points to 39 basis points compared to Q4 2018, net charge-offs were modestly higher, driven primarily by seasoning of the card portfolio. Provision expense was $941 million and mostly mass net charge-offs, with only modest releases in both Q4 2019 and Q4 2018.On Slide 14, we break out credit quality metrics for both our Consumer and Commercial portfolios. These metrics show you that asset quality remained strong in both categories.Before turning to the Business segments, I will just provide a couple of perspectives on CECL. Our day one implementation resulted in a $3.3 billion increase in allowance. This is in line with the last update we gave you. All else equal, this would lower our CET1 ratio by roughly 20 basis points, but as you know, it is phased into regulatory capital evenly through 2023.Turning to the Business segments and starting with Consumer Banking on Slide 15. Consumer Banking produced another solid quarter of revenue and earnings, but was heavily impacted by lower rates in the second half of 2019. Net income of $3.1 billion declined 10%, as revenue fell 4%.As you know, we have been renovating and adding financial centers, adding sales professionals and advancing digital capabilities. Plus, we increased our minimum wage in 2019 and will again in Q1. Despite the cost of increased investments, we have been able to hold expenses relatively flat and our efficiency ratio was 47%. Away from the impact of rates, which we can't control, client momentum continued as we saw healthy spending, borrowing and savings by clients.As a result year-over-year average deposits increased by $33 billion, up 5% to $720 billion, while maintaining strong pricing discipline. Client investments increased $54 billion, up 29% year-over-year to $240 billion driven primarily by the market, but we also saw $20 billion of client flows and our total net accounts grew 7%.Loans were up a healthy 7%, driven by home loans, debit and credit spending by our customers was up 6% year-over-year, consistent with a record holiday season, and asset quality in this segment remained strong, with a net charge-off ratio of 118 basis points, down modestly from last year.Turning to Slide 16. I will quickly note continued positive trends across deposits, loans and investments, all of which I touched upon earlier. This level of activity continues to drive the acknowledgments and rankings in the upper left. And this is a short list of the more than 60 industry awards, consumer and Digital Banking received in 2019.Turning to Slide 17. Digital Banking continued to drive growth in client engagement as we continue to invest heavily in this channel, as a strong complement to our financial centers and ATM network. Together they allowed our customers to bank with us, anywhere, anytime and any way they want.Over 56% of our clients are now digitally active and logged in 8.1 billion times this year, that's up 9% year-over-year. Digital channels generated 27% of overall sales, 34% of mortgages and 56% of client direct auto loans originated through our mobile app or online banking site.The digital mortgage experience itself originated $11 billion in loans in 2019, as we continue to add capabilities, such as the ability to transfer HELOC balances on a mobile device. And with respect to mobile car shopping, we closed the year with the ability to provide clients' access to roughly 2 million cars from our participating dealer inventories.Our market share with Zelle payments continued to increase this year as well. We now have 9.7 million Zelle users, and they sent and received 300 million transfers this year, totaling over $78 billion. Erica surpassed 10 million total users and completed nearly 100 million requests since its launch, with 38% penetration of active BAC mobile users.27% of total deposits are now coming from mobile, and over 50% of our clients have gone completely paperless, enhancing our efficiency and their experience. And customers increased their use of our mobile banking app to make appointments with 2.3 million digital appointments scheduled in 2019, up 19% year-over-year. Our efforts to move customers past enrollment to engagement in digital capabilities are stronger than ever, and we believe industry-leading.Turning to Global Wealth and Investment Management on Slide 18. Strong results were led by growth across AUM, loans and deposits, as well as good market conditions in the quarter, but also reflected the headwinds of lower interest rates.Record level client balances topped $3 trillion, and our full-year pre-tax margin was 29%. With $256 billion in deposits, this segment would rank standalone as the seventh or eighth largest bank in the U.S. So when rates fall, GWIM feels it, but much of the impact of foreign rates was offset by advisory fees, generated from our industry-leading Wealth Management platform.Net income was just over $1 billion, down 4% from Q4 2018, reflecting lower interest rates and the absence of a prior year gain from the sale of a non-core asset, which also impacted the revenue comparisons. Excluding the prior-year gain, revenue was flat and earnings grew 3%.Asset Management fees grew 5% year-over-year due to higher market valuations, and the fees from AUM flows, which more than offset general pricing pressures and lower transactional revenue. Expenses decreased slightly, as investments in sales professionals technology and our brand were more than offset by lower intangible amortization and deposit insurance costs.Digital engagement with affluent clients continue to increase in importance, as 64% of Merrill clients are actively using our mobile or online platform, and that statistic increased to more than 75% for the private \u2013 our private bank clients.Moving to Slide 19. GWIM activity reflects the confidence clients place in Bank of America and its advisors at both Merrill and the private bank. As Brian mentioned, household growth has been strong, as Merrill added more than 40,000 net new households this year, and we added 60% more private bank relationships in 2019, than we did in 2018.On the bottom right, note the $427 billion increase in client balances in Q4 2018, $383 billion of that increase reflected strong market conditions, increasing the value of assets, $44 billion of the increase is from client flows. AUM flows accounted for $25 billion, while brokerage flows contributed $6 billion.Banking product flows were driven by loans of $12 billion, which doubled from 2018. And deposit flows were modestly negative, as clients shifted cash back into investments during the year, following the 4Q 2018 equity market declines. Average deposits rose 3%.Turning to Global Banking on Slide 20. The business earned $2 billion and generated a 20% return on allocated capital in the quarter. An 8% decline in net income was driven by lower NII and higher investments costs, which outpaced the improvement from investment banking income and leasing related gains.Continued strong deposit and loan growth reflects the benefit of adding hundreds of bankers over the past few years, increasing our client coverage, as well as continued advancement in how we deliver our loan product and treasury services. These investments will continue to benefit the franchise for many years to come, as new bankers deepen existing relationships and add new ones.Looking at trends on Slide 21 and comparing to Q4 last year. Throughout the year, we continue to add investment bankers both in the U.S. and internationally, with a focus on expanding our client coverage. This benefited NII fees, with Q4 fees of nearly $1.5 billion, up 9% year-over-year.Despite \u2013 double-digit increases in both debt and equity underwriting fees, led the year-over-year improvement. Bank of America was involved in seven of the Top 10 debt deals, and six of the Top 10 equity deals in the quarter, based upon Dealogic data this performance drove a 50 basis point improvement in market share for the full-year.Turning to Slide 22. One of the reasons for the growth in deposits and Global Banking has been our consistent investment over multiple years in digital capabilities and transaction services. Note the growth in mobile and digital usage at the top of the page, and our focus on solutions for clients on the bottom of the page.Switching to Global Markets on Slide 23. As I usually do, I will talk about results excluding DVA. Global Markets produced $639 million of earnings, year-over-year revenue was up 10%, from both higher sales and trading results, and improved investment banking fees. Expenses were up a more modest 2% year-over-year, within revenue, sales and trading improved 13% year-over-year, driven by fixed income, currency and commodities, with a more risk on environment, when compared to Q4 last year.FICC was up 25% from Q4 2014, while equities declined modestly. FICC revenue showed improved results across most products, but was particularly strong in mortgage products. The muted performance in equities was driven by lower client activities and derivatives, which was partially offset by our financing business, where we have focused some investments.On Slide 24, you can see that our mix of sales and trading revenue remained weighted to domestic activity, where global fee pools are centered. Within FICC, revenue mix remained weighted towards credit products, and importantly, please note on the bottom left, at roughly $13 billion, the consistency of our sales and trading revenue over the past six years in the face of declining fee pools. It is particularly noteworthy, considering the risk reduction note at the bottom right. This goes against the perception, that these revenues are generally considered to be more variable.Finally, turning to Slide 25. We show All Other, which reported a profit of $262 million, comparing against Q3 2019 is tough, because that period included the $2.1 billion pre-tax impairment charge on our Bank of America Merchant Services joint venture.But there are two things worth noting as I close out. First, other income, at the total company level this quarter, included tax advantaged investment partnership losses that were about $200 million higher, when you compare to Q3. The benefits of this activity shows up in Global Banking \u2013 in our Global Banking business, and are produced by client activity, related to tax advantaged solar and wind investments.These investments generate good returns. However, the partnership losses, which reduce non-interest income and the tax benefit in our tax line from these investments, are not always realized in the same quarter, depending upon the type of investment.The second thing I want to mention is the effective tax rate in the quarter of approximately 14%. It included the impact of higher tax credits from the increased tax-advantaged investments, and it also included roughly $300 million in discrete benefits from the resolution of several tax matters. Absent the discrete benefits in the quarter, our Q4 2019 tax rate would have been roughly 18%, and absent any unusual items, this is roughly where we expect the ETR for full-year 2020 to be.So thanks, and with that we will open it up to Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question today from John McDonald with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead. John McDonald : Hi, good morning. Paul, wanted to ask on the NII outlook. When you put together your commentary about the quarters, year-over-year, does that imply flat to down a little bit maybe on the NII in terms of your outlook against flat rates? Paul Donofrio : Yes. Year-over-year modestly, I would say John McDonald : Down modestly? Paul Donofrio : Yes. John McDonald : Okay. And then how are you feeling \u2013 I guess if we think about positive operating leverage for this year, you mentioned the stability in expenses while you continue to invest. How are you feeling on fee income growth and when you wrap it all together, the prospects for positive operating leverage into 2020? Paul Donofrio : So obviously, we talked about in the prepared remarks the transition that we're going through in the rate environment. I would just remind everybody we had 18 consecutive quarters of positive operating leverage. And admittedly, it's a little bit more difficult to achieve operating leverage given the decline in interest rates last year, and the associated impact on NII.As I said though, assuming a more stable rate environment, we would expect NII to return to growth in the second half of 2020 driven by loan and deposit growth. And remember NII is not directly linked to expenses the way other revenue is in, for example, investment banking, sales and trading, wealth management. We run and invest in the company for the long-term sustainability and for growth, and by the way these investments over many years lay the foundation for operating leverage.So having said all that, we're not blind to changes in the operating environment, but we are also not managing rigidly to quarterly financial metrics. We are focused on the things that we can control like driving like client activity, deposits, loans, investments, and efficiency improvements through our focus on operational excellence. So if things change, we'll adjust, but currently we feel our client activity and market share gains continue to support our investment plans in the near term. John McDonald : Okay. Fair enough. Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Please go ahead. Glenn Schorr : Thank you. I have a follow-up question on your comments on the promo balances in cards and your pullback there. And I'm curious if that is a function of pricing getting tougher there, terms getting tougher there, or is that your just responsible thought process 11 years into a recovery? Paul Donofrio : I think it's more a reflection of responsible growth, and how we run, how we're focused on the customer, and how we're focused on total revenue, and not necessarily NII or fees. When you look at card balances, they certainly reflect a couple of items that we talked about, and it certainly reflects our focus more on profitability. First, we've been reevaluating some relationship prospects who are just looking to gain rewards or take a short-term \u2013 take short-term advantage of promo balances. So clearly that's affected balances a little bit.Also with less promo balances, the percentage of the portfolio paying off each month has risen a bit. I think what you see though, if you look at our risk-adjusted margin, that's up 25 basis points year-over-year to 8.7% if you adjust out the 4Q gains we had last year, and we continue to have more than million cards each month again with a focus on profitability of new accounts. So I think that line is going to start to grow from here. Brian Moynihan : I think, Glenn, just to be \u2013 with Paul's lost point \u2013 production of new customers taking the card product from us and the usage continues to grow, so we had 1 million plus new cardholders. We still have a lot of room to go from a two-thirds type of penetration of customer base and then how many people use it as a primary card. So we really focus a lot on that, and while we're focused on that, generating new customers who are surfing is not exactly the strategy. So it's a mix of profitability, but also really sticking to that core holistic customer strategy. Glenn Schorr : Appreciate that. Just one more maybe on GWIM. So market's up a lot and more people going fee-based offset lower rates, and you talked about that. So we've been hanging in this 28% to 30% range, which is great. But the question I have is can \u2013 as scale continues to build in all the investments that you've made there, can we see margins start to tick up a little bit above there? I know we are constrained by the payouts and things like that. Just curious, the bigger picture over the next couple of years. Brian Moynihan : Yes. So think about it in two dimensions. One, inside the Wealth Management business, is a very large bank. So if rates stable here from here, then the loan-to-deposit growth, which have been strong will then pick up that, and that's very leveraged to the margin \u2013 contribute to the margin. That's one point. So you are going through the same twist in that business and with the 75 basis point drop in rates in this very late part of last few months of 2019. So that's no different than many other situations, so that will mitigate and go forward.If you think about the other side of the question, which is sort of, can you get it higher, you've got the basic thing, the way that the compensation system runs from a way of presentation is you've got 50% of revenue. Round numbers goes into the compensation. So you're basically making $0.30 on the other $0.50 in profit margin, which is a pretty strong margin. So it has all the opportunities along the dimensions, which is a [indiscernible] set of things that we've got to go after, which is \u2013 if you think about the Merrill Edge assets growing in the MEGI portfolio, which is over $4 billion and growing 30%, 50% a year type of things.As they grow, and the products are available to Andy's to whole team of FAs, that provides additional efficiency. And then you think about the digitization of that customer base in both private bank and wealth in Merrill Lynch, which is the least penetrated of all the customer base in terms of digital statements and things like that, we can drive the margins that way. Then the physical plant, we continue to increase the density of the physical plant with other physical plant in various cities and towns, consolidating offices and getting people in a common space that saves money.So there is a lot of way we can work on digitization, physical plant efficiency, adding more financial advisors to have more scale in contributing the overhead which then generates more margin. So you're working \u2013 it's pretty good to make $0.60 \u2013 60% of your margin after comp, and we're not changing the comp system, but there's a lot of things forward, and I think we can continue to improve them.It would appear to be easier or if, in fact, rates stay stable and drive loan growth, which is what our projection is, and if rates start rising again, we will look like heroes in terms of margin, but we've been able to sustain it even in a falling rate environment. Glenn Schorr : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Steven Chubak : Hey, good morning. So I wanted to ask a follow-up on fee income. So the NII resiliency has been quite impressive. Loan deposit account growth, as you noted, Paul and Brian, continues to track very well. The core fee growth was a bit softer this past year, declined modestly despite some of the strong market tailwinds. I know, Brian in the past you haven't given explicit guidance on core fee growth expectations, but you did note that it should traject in line with GDP. And just given some of the moderating U.S. and global GDP growth expectations you cited earlier, just trying to think about how we should be modeling or forecasting fee income expectations in the coming years? Brian Moynihan : I think each category \u2013 if you think about the broad categories where most of them come through, the strategy in the consumer business has been to reduce reliance over the last decade plus on penalty fees and things like that, we kind of hit status quo on that. In other words, we brought it down significantly from Reg E and all that stuff is kind of done, the interchange in the consumer fee areas, the card income stuff that's through the system at this point. The rewards impact that, but you get the benefit back in a preferred rewards system through the ability to have that stable margin.So I think we should see those fees, which have gotten to a point where they ought to grow marginally. But remember, that part of the strategy is to invest in our client base, loyalty to our company and our products. And so they\u2019ll be modest because of the NII growth. Think about 8% growth in checking balances year-over-year in consumer. That is helped driven by people consolidating a relationship with you, which you pay back to the reward system through the card usage. So it's always going to be that.When you go to wealth management, you tell me what the market is going to do and you'll see that it will be heavily influenced there that should grow faster. As you know, trading as Paul said, isn't as volatile as people want it to \u2013 discuss it, but on the other hand, there's compression on the fee side. So each line items has a different element. Treasury services revenue is up, I think, at the high-single digits. But the fee line piece of it's flattish, that's because people are paying us through balances.So I think that Steven, a guy like me who has been around banks for a long time, the differentiation between types of revenue fee versus spread is becoming harder as the business models have morphed them together in just terms of total revenue. So we ought to go revenue slightly faster than the economy and have the expenses grow below that by couple hundred basis points, and we've been able to do that, and as this twist in rates ends this quarter, you'll see us get back on track, as we move through 2020. Steven Chubak : Thanks for that color, Brian. And maybe just a follow-up for you Paul. You've been retaining a substantial percentage of mortgage loans on balance sheet in lieu of selling those loans, you're deploying that excess liquidity into MBS. And I'm just wondering, as we prepare for CECL, does that inform your appetite or your willingness to continue down the same path, and just separately, just given the strength of your credit position and a relatively clean balance sheet, was sort of hoping you guys could be CECL pioneers, and maybe the first bank to provide some more concrete guidance, in terms of day two provision impacts or expectations? Paul Donofrio : Well in your first point we are originating mortgages and putting 94% of them, I think this quarter on the balance sheet. That will continue to trend that we've been doing for many quarters now. We'll see how that develops over the long-term. But for now, that's our plan.Clearly, we consider the effect on liquidity, we consider the effect on capital balancing, returning capital with growing the balance sheet. Those loans don't really have a high amount of CECL impact. So but I'm not saying we're going to never change what we're doing there. In terms of CECL, I think we've given you the guidance that we're comfortable with.We would expect provision to be a little higher than net charge-offs in 2020, and due to CECL, we've been running \u2013 when you back everything out, we've been running net charge-offs at approximately $1 billion a quarter. We don't see that changing much in the future, and when you just factor CECL into that, it means that our provision's going to have to be a little bit higher than net charge-offs. Brian Moynihan : You always have to remember that the \u2013 not on the last part, but on the first part. At the end of day, the reason why we have securities and mortgage-backed securities and treasuries is simple. When you're doing $60 billion in deposit growth and your loan balances grew by $10 billion or $20 billion, the other half has to go to be invested somewhere and you're raising this money in all-in costs in the 40 basis points of deposit pricing across the whole board, and a lot of it's coming in non-interest.You're not going to turn down that good customer activity and we don't take credit risk in that part of the portfolio, because we take enough credit risk around the rest of the company. And so the strategy on the investment side, mortgage backs had put with treasuries and think that as just excess liquidity on mortgages.Paul told you that, we've been putting on the balance sheet, because they're better yielding than mortgage-backed securities and frankly, our credit risk is better than the mortgage-backed securities' availability. So why would we pay for somebody else for taking that risk. Steven Chubak : Fair enough. And I appreciate you guys taking the day two plunge as well. Operator : We'll take our next question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good morning. Brian Moynihan : Good morning, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : Brian, 10 years of excellent management here driving the bus on improving operating leverage, especially over the past three, four years? Can you give us a sense, as to how you see the rate of change go from here, because we've had obviously significant improvement in the consumer side, and the question I get from people is, is it over and by the way, how do you generate positive operating leverage in global banks and global markets, given the SKU to producers, and is there that much opportunity in the back office side? So maybe if you could hit on those that would be helpful. Thanks. Brian Moynihan : So let me paraphrase a little bit. But it's a delectation to be able to run this company with all the power and have the honor doing it for decades. So we just passed a decade with the team, and they've done a great job. But what you point out, as they've done a great job of putting the position.So if you look at the operating efficiency of the Consumer business or the Wealth Management business or the Banking business, which we show separately from the markets business, so you can see, these are 38%, 40% efficiency ratios here, 45% here. It's how can you improve.And Betsey what I'd say is, we just don't know how far this digitization of the actual processes and work goes in the company, and we just keep coming up. We had 6,000 simplified improved ideas over the last few years we've implemented. They continue to produce great savings. And so, we just don't see an end of that. And so leave aside that the economy is growing at a sub-2% level predicted at 20%, we decided that the rate environment is low, we've been able to push forward the activities that can produce more efficiency, and we think that there is a lot ahead of us.And so we'd say nice start to our team, saying thanks for all the hard work you've done. But also, we're only getting started here, and if you start thinking about \u2013 we just passed, the number of checking accounts that we had in 2007 in this company this quarter.And so, we ran off all the non-primary accounts, but on our primary accounts, the average balance of $7,000. If you think about the cost of deposits and consumer, I think it went down by 4 basis points year-over-year something like that. So it's a grind, and it's a lot of hard work, but the incremental efficiency that we can get at this scale, by these investments and by the digitization and the further taking out of activity which costs more.Another example is checks written, since Zelle became really pushed out there about two years ago, has started dropping 10% per year. So five years ago, we had almost $1 billion checks written by consumers, and now we're down to $600 million. Each one of those checks is a piece of paper that requires processing time, and you're seeing that drop by 10% a year.Is that going to change overnight, where they're gone? Absolutely not. But on the other hand, it's constant positive operating pressure benefit for us. So look for us to improve it across the board, your colleague earlier asked about the Wealth Management business, we think we have upside there. Andy and Katy and the teams are working on it. There is lot of process simplification that we've worked on hard, but there's a lot ahead of us.And then you get the markets business, the electronification effect will make it more and more efficient over time, like we've seen in equities. As you know though, that's a market price business, so that you always fighting the revenue changes at the same time and in fact, if you look at most of this from four, five years ago, we actually had the same amount of trading profits we had then.We just turned it into this quarter, $600 million of profit, generally $1 billion of profit, when it's getting a little bit better in the earlier quarters and the activity is higher. That's a good business. It's just you're fighting both sides of equation. So look for us to improve everything. There is room to improve, tremendous scale advantages. The new markets opening up provide extra lift and it's our job to do it and the team is excited too. Betsy Graseck : Okay. Good forward look there, Paul, on the longer-term. Paul, maybe I could just be a little bit nearer term with a question for you. I think you mentioned a couple of times that NII expectation for 2020 being down modestly from 2019 for your full-year. But then you talked a little bit about a better second half than first half, and maybe you could give us a little bit more detail on the granularity, why you expect that to be the case? I assume it's with the forward curve and flattish rates. But I know, you some color earlier on, but maybe give a little sense more of, like what's behind that conviction level that year-on-year you get some improvement in the back half? Paul Donofrio : I think it's about loan and deposit growth and its about deposit pricing discipline. On deposit pricing, we planned some modest reductions in deposit pricing, assuming no further cuts, as we continue to bring deposit pricing to an appropriate level, given the three cuts that we've experienced.If the forward curve materializes and we get another short end cut, we expect deposit rate paid for the industry, and for us to decline even further, as higher pass-through products in Wealth Management Global Banking react relatively quickly to any rate cut. So it's about the confidence we have and how we price our products, and the confidence we have in growing deposits and growing loans.The guidance is more about \u2013 we have an one less day in Q1 we've got to deal with. We have the second quarter. Normal activity that we see in equities, which again, that's a plus, that just shows up in non-interest income instead of interest income. And by the time you get to the third quarter, we would expect, assuming the current sort of economic environment, we would expect our loan and deposit growth, the lack of that seasonality, the deposit pricing to have an effect and we'll start growing again. Brian Moynihan : I'd just add to that, your question and John's question go the same direction, which is \u2013 you've got this quarter and the first couple of quarters because of the dynamics, Paul just described that. You have to push through, but what we see is getting back on, as we move into the middle of 2020. We're back on that basic operating leverage through NII stability to growth and expense flatness. So but it just takes a lot to get underneath 75 basis point rate cut in four months. Betsy Graseck : Okay, that's helpful. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead. James Mitchell : Hey, good morning guys. Maybe I could just follow-up on that last question in a different way. Is your expectation that the net interest margin should start to stabilize in the back half of the year? Is that what gives you the confidence in the NII growth, or is it really \u2013 do we still should expect maybe a grind down of NIMs, but the balance sheet growth starts to takeover?How do we think about when, in the current rate environment, the sort of net interest margin, assuming mix is unchanged, obviously it's a big assumption, but do we assume that NIM starts to stabilize in the second half of this year? Paul Donofrio : I think that's what \u2013 you've correctly summarized succinctly what we said. James Mitchell : Okay. So maybe I get another question. So just on the deposit growth... Brian Moynihan : We will award you a bonus question for that one. James Mitchell : Just on the deposit growth, the industry, we've seen some acceleration in 4Q. We have lower short-term rates. We have the Fed balance sheet expansion, there tends to be some seasonality in 4Q. How do we \u2013 do you think this acceleration can continue into the \u2013 at least the first half of this year? I guess how do you think about the deposit growth, and if there \u2013 if we could see continued sort of above mid single-digit growth? Paul Donofrio : I think if you look at Page 9, when you have rate movement due to the types of things that are \u2013 reestablish the reserve levels by the Federal Reserve, et cetera, et cetera that's going to affect the lower \u2013 our markets business in the lower right hand, and banking, stuff like that.But it really doesn't have that much of an impact in the Wealth Management and the Consumer Banking area, and that's really what drives the value. So for the $700 billion odd dollars in the consumer business, which grew checking at 8% year-over-year, and that's fairly consistent with what they've been doing.Remember, that its 11 basis point all-in, including the interest bearing part of, which also grew year-over-year. So that $700 million a year in total interest expense for $700 million of deposits. That's what drives the economics, and then Wealth Management Global Banking, also but \u2013 and so that isn't really affected by all the sort of broad macroeconomic variables.That's just us doing a great job with consumers. The great customer satisfaction, great product capabilities, high touch, high tech and then generating more and more checking accounts, where the average balance per checking account is $7,000 plus and growing, and that's what's going to drive it.So I'd say you're absolutely right. There can be momentary things that would enhance deposit growth in some of the pure institutional businesses. But it doesn't make much difference to the general U.S. consumer. James Mitchell : Okay. That's helpful. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Michael Mayo : Hi. Brian Moynihan : Hi Mike. Michael Mayo : The simple question is what is the dollar amount of tech spending and investment spending in 2019? And how does that compare to last year, and this coming one. And the backdrop to that question is, the efficient \u2013 you've gotten a lot of questions on efficiency on this call, and it was worse in the fourth quarter, and your 58% efficiency for the year is not where some other banks are targeting, like 55%.Now, we know that you're spending a lot of money. We can see Slide 3. You've pointed out that the spending is paying off. So if you could just put a wrapper around the spending and put a number to it, then we, as analysts can figure out, okay, a more core efficiency level, if you would. Brian Moynihan : So one of the things that just in our efficiency ratio compared to other people or 58% for the year, but remember that we have a lot more wealth management at 30% \u2013 or 28%, 29% profit, pre-tax margin i.e. 71% efficiency ratio than anybody else does. That changes that answer relative to some of our core banking peers.It's just a bigger, bigger number, because we have the biggest business for $3 trillion in assets, making $1 billion a quarter after tax at the best margins, but it's just the sheer math. So when you look at it by business unit by business unit, our efficiency is the tops in the class, just our mix is different. So I'll let you figure that out, Mike.But back to your tech spend, we spent $3.2 billion or $3 billion in 2018, the same in 2019, we have it scheduled to be the same this year. It's just \u2013 this constant level of spending. Now its different products obviously every year, that's pure technology initiatives. You put that on top of the backbone and everything, and the number of people could talk about be higher.But that is just to drive new products and capabilities and through the system, and we aren't changing that, because that's what's driving that ability to keep expenses flat. If you look across the chart, Paul showed you when you see 2017, 2018 and 2019 in the expenses per quarter running $13.1 billion, $13.3 billion et cetera, think about how much we've done in there, in terms of hundreds of new branches. 1,300 or so, complete redos, new buildings for our teammates in Wealth Management, et cetera, et cetera. And so that \u2013 those are tremendous investment levels that are all in the run rate, while we're chopping away, and that's coming from the operational excellence.So we're spending that much on technology, but the question isn't spend, Mike, it's are you getting the usage out of it, and that's where you got to look at things like the usage of Zelle, which we're going to 80%, 90% a year, the use of the cash per mobile which grew over 100% a year that usage what I talked about in checks written coming down.Even I talked about, that we have 4,300 branches, but in there, we've actually opened up to new markets over the last couple of years. 15 branches to 20 branches et cetera and continue to do that. So the efficiency, in the rest of markets funds that, even though your numbers of branches are relatively flattish. So we're coming down slightly. So it's a complex set of things, but hopefully that gives you some color. Michael Mayo : Yes. I guess I'll try one more time, since it's not in your tech number, like you are expanding to new markets, you are opening new branches, you are hiring new associates, how much does this investing increase the growth rate of expenses? Brian Moynihan : It's $3.3 billion. So it's in the run rate. And last year \u2013 and it will be the like amount this year. So could you take half of that out? You could, it'd just be not the right thing to do for the Company, but it's paid for by the other \u2013 the cost takeout that supports or the mix in how the customer uses, which provides efficiencies, so more than 50% of our auto loans are originated digitally today.I think we did something like $4 billion or $5 billion of mortgage originations. So its \u2013 we're reaping the benefits of it, Mike, three years hence, is the investments we made in 2017, as you go into 2020 are produced \u2013 for example digital auto did not exist, and now you are getting 58%. Just think how much more efficient that processes is. Digital Mortgage... Michael Mayo : Let me just try one more. And then one more time \u2013 like this tax spend to run the bank, change the bank, I assume you're spending more to change the bank today versus three or four years ago, and you \u2013 that mix goes more toward change the bank. What are the figures and where do you think they are headed? Brian Moynihan : Yes. The $3 billion plus, obviously with Brexit behind us with \u2013 by the regulatory environment rules behind us in terms of implementing the CCAR and the capital rules and then lot of modeling, and you're still spending money improving that data to make those models work. That's gone.The only thing that works against that is \u2013 so yes, if you thought about how much is going to sort of new business initiatives, the mobile banking, feature functionality, it's higher in 2020 than it was in 2019 than it was in 2018, largely around this issue that you are running off some of these long-term projects, which is good. Michael Mayo : All right, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Your line is open. Brian Moynihan : Good morning, Gerard. Gerard Cassidy : Good morning, Brian. How are you? Brian, can you remind us, you touched on \u2013 in some of your comments already about the number of checks that were processed five years ago versus today. When you move it from the paper to the digital, can you share \u2013 remind us what the cost savings are when you do that, per unit? Brian Moynihan : So that was kind of checks written by our customers, which is this good point, because that stops the thing before it starts. But it basically, if you look at deposit, which I think is what you're referring to, Gerard, we are now more mobile than we are at the branches and have been for about five quarters, and then the ATMs are still half, the mobile is a little over like 27% or something like that, and branches are the rest. So if you think about that, that is $5 in physical movement, $0.50 and $0.05. $0.50 at the ATM and $0.05 round numbers. Gerard Cassidy : Great. And then moving on with credit, can you guys give us any color \u2013 I mean, credit is strong across the board for almost all the banks, and are you guys keeping an eye on any particular sectors within your portfolio? And then as part of that question, we sensed from some of your peers that have reported that the corporates or commercial customers seem to be maybe a little more optimistic in the fourth quarter because of some of these trade issues. If you could comment on that, if you're seeing that in your customer base as well? Brian Moynihan : I'll take the second half and I\u2019ll let Paul. Yes, you are seeing with the \u2013 leave aside what happens day-to-day, but generally companies are seeing the resolutions emerge for some of these issues. That makes \u2013 a little bit more confidence in terms of our activities, we'll hopefully see that in the first half of this year, if nothing goes backwards. The market being up, obviously gives people a good feeling. But one of the thing you have to think about is, in the first part of 2019, Gerard, you had your inventory decline recession, as people would call it. That went through the system. So you've entered a new place, right.So you come down, you hit a bottom, and then you start to grow out from there. We're kind of in that transition phase. So I think the combination of the external environment getting the deal today with China, obviously, is a resolution of one of the issues that was over people's minds. There are other USMCA. Everybody says it's going to be passed. I think that capacity would be very helpful to people. The fact that people have done what they needed to do, it was during the year 2019 to change supply chains and think about it.That's disruptive without endpoint value to the customer, so to speak, and it's like us with Brexit, we spent $400 million plus money. The customers didn't get better services out of it. We just had to create more entities and get them up and running. Those things are sort of through the system. So I think that what you're feeling is a little bit of a relief on the other side of that work, which was being done, and worry, which is being done without a lot of activity. And so even capital expenditures, which grew at a much slower rate off the high in 2018, you're starting \u2013 our experts say will stabilize and kind of come out from there.And on credit, Paul? Paul Donofrio : Sure. So on credit, I'd start by saying that we are always running through the portfolio, routinely analyzing various sectors, bringing it to senior management, discussing it. So we've got a real great process for always looking for some risks that are on the horizon. As you know, we've been running the company with strong underwriting standards for years now. You see that in our CCAR results. So I mean, I hesitate to sort of pick one sector or another because we noticed stuff out in the marketplace, but it may not affect us directly given how we've run the company for years now.But if you're looking for some sectors that we're paying attention to, not that we think we're overly concerned about them given how we've managed the company. But we're certainly paying attention to leverage loan market, leverage lending. We're certainly paying attention to energy with respect to natural gas prices. We are certainly looking at retail with respect to enclosed malls. We've got our eye on \u2013 always have our eye on spots around the world that maybe experiencing a little disruption. So that's how I'd answer that question. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. Thank you. Operator : We'll now go to Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Kenneth Usdin : Hey, thanks. Good morning. Just a question on the balance sheet and capital. So you're at 11.2% CET1, your stated target has been around 10%. We're still waiting for the SCB finalization. Two questions, so one, any anticipated changes to where you think your capital goal might be, depending on what we get? And then secondly, have you gotten a point where you would might rethink the mix between your dividend payout, which is lower than peers and the buyback in terms of the mix? Thanks. Paul Donofrio : I mean I'll start on I guess buffers and you can \u2013 Brian, you might want to pick up on the dividends or buybacks. But look today, as you point out, we have a meaningful cushion. So it's really not an issue for us right now. In terms of what our ultimate buffer is going to be, when we don't have as much of a cushion, we haven't really talked about that publicly, because we don't think it makes sense today to prejudge what a buffer needs to be, given the size of the current question and given \u2013 as you mentioned, regulations, SCB other things are still changing, and lots of things can affect that buffer, when we get there. But I would just emphasize, we have a sizable buffer right now. Brian Moynihan : In terms of dividend versus buyback. Yes, we will keep increasing the dividend as we move up to sort of the 30% level and earnings payout, we've been clear about that. And then the rest will go into reducing the share count. And if you look at the page we showed you earlier, part of the issue was \u2013 the share count was a lot higher than people expected sort of in the 2009 timeframe, after the Merrill transaction.So we're pushing that back down, and we think that's a good use of our capital. We don't need the capital to fund the loan growth and deposit growth, you're seeing us able to do that through continuing to fine-tune the balance sheet. And so expect us to move the dividend up, consistent with what we've done before, assuming CCAR approval and all that good stuff.But the idea is we will keep it at a level that allows us to use the share buyback, to help drive the EPS growth, and you saw the benefits of that year-over-year, in an environment where, the rate movements made earnings flatten in the second half of the year. What you saw was, EPS year-over-year was up double-digits, because we can retire the shares. And so we think that's the best thing to do for the shareholders. Kenneth Usdin : Understood. Thank you, guys. Operator : We'll take our next question from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Matthew O'Connor: Hi guys. I was just wondering if you could talk about the pace of loan growth that you're expecting for 2020. Maybe both kind of within the business lines, and then net from the drive for run-off? And then maybe the drivers of growth and if that's changing at all, versus what it has been the last, kind of 6 months to 12 months, obviously commercial for the industry has slowed. Maybe that's temporary. So just talk about the pace and the drivers of loan growth this year? Thanks. Brian Moynihan : Sure. So look, growth in our Business segments should continue to be kind of mid-single-digits. As you know, we grew 6% this quarter. Both consumer and GWIM grew at 7%, driven by increased residential mortgage activity, Global Banking grew 6% year-over-year and that was driven by large corporates, middle market companies, leasing activity and solid growth in international regions. So pretty broad-based.We anticipate solid growth in consumer loans, assuming the current economic environment, as well as the sort of pull-through of applications through \u2013 mortgage application through the pipeline. With respect to card, we've already talked a little bit about that. We expect that we can start growing card over time here. With respect to residential mortgages, originations were strong this quarter. They were up significantly.So that's going to translate to solid Q1 growth. However, you have to remember that that's going be partially offset by continued run-off of the non-core portfolio. We expect our growth to be up modestly year-over-year. We expect solid growth in small business, and remember, in all these categories that I'm talking about, we remain focused on prime and super-prime and on commercial loans, our outlook remains favorable, again growth year-over-year should be in sort of mid single-digits. So that's how I'd run through it. Matthew O'Connor: Okay. And then netting out the kind of mid single-digit growth in the Business segments with the run-off, do you think you kind of stay in the space of 4% growth that you saw this quarter, as some of the macro holes? Brian Moynihan : Yes. Paul Donofrio : Yes. If you look at the run-off chart on the loan page there, in the upper right hand corner, you see that \u2013 we basically have gotten really to the point where that's now natural run off, will \u2013 there won't be any sales of major impacts for purposes that we were doing before to \u2013 we continue to move loans, on which we weren't getting any income on, because of their status in terms of restructuring and things like that out and cleaning the portfolio up. So that's just smaller, so I think that helps the overall nominal growth for the company. Brian Moynihan : It's going to be $1.5 billion, $2 billion a quarter. Matthew O'Connor: Okay. So it might be $1.5 billion or $2 billion of loan sales, but nothing major that's what you are saying? Brian Moynihan : No, no, not loan sales. Paul Donofrio : That run-off\u2026 Brian Moynihan : The run-off is running at about $1.5 billion, $2 billion per quarter. Paul Donofrio : Of just natural paydowns in those mortgages and home equities. Matthew O'Connor: Got it. Okay, that's helpful. Thank you. Operator : We'll take our last question today from Saul Martinez with UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Saul Martinez : Hey, good morning guys. So forgive me for beating a dead horse on the efficiency ratio question, but I guess I'll ask it in a slightly different way. I mean, you guys are out about 57%, 58% even with GWIM being a big part of the overall mix, revenue mix. But if we assume that revenue growth gets back to say, GDP growth over time.Is there any reason why you couldn't reduce your efficiency ratio below, say the mid 50s percent range into the low 50s, given some of the opportunities you talked about Brian, and just secular trends towards digitization, electronification of payments, which obviously reduce to this unit costs pretty materially. It doesn't seem like there is an obvious reason why you couldn't continue to drive that down pretty materially even from here. Brian Moynihan : That's what we're doing. If we keep expenses flat and the basis of the premise was if the revenue grows, PDP plus, that's 200 basis points of operating leverage and that will keep producing the efficiency ratio by definition. So you're stating what our job is, and we've been able to do it and we'll continue to. Saul Martinez : Okay. So there is no obvious \u2013 is there any point at which, or any obvious point at which it becomes just much more difficult or is there is \u2013 the glide path from here is just, it seems like there is nothing really to prevent you from doing that for a while? Brian Moynihan : We'll let you know when we think we can't do it anymore. But we don't see it. Saul Martinez : Okay, got it. All right, thanks a lot. Operator : We have no further questions at this time. It is now my pleasure to turn the call back to Brian Moynihan for any closing remarks. Brian Moynihan : Well thank you all of you for your attention on the call. We finished another strong year in 2019 for the team, and they did a great job growing the earnings, doing it the right way, making the investments across the franchise.As we say, it's a nice start. We'll continue to focus on responsible growth. We've got a lot of room to run in this company. Every business had good client activity. The loan, deposit, underlying customer growth at the size and scale this institution, tremendous work by our teammates, and all that helped us provide stable performance, with a rate cut that came through relatively late in the year. So we feel good about that, and we feel good about working through the other side of it, as Paul described earlier.We are focused on the costs, as many of you asked about. But we're focused on continuing to develop and implement products and services, which meet the markets' needs and continue to help us grow our market share across every business at the rate we're doing it, which we think is an opportunity, which is ours to continue to take. Thank you. Operator : This does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at anytime.",

Later, you will have the opportunity to ask questions during the question-and-answer session. Please note this call may be recorded. I will be standing by should you need any assistance. It is now my pleasure to turn today\u2019s conference over to Lee McEntire, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Lee McEntire : Good morning. Thank you, Katherine. Thanks for joining the call to review our first quarter results. By now, I hope everybody\u2019s had a chance to review the earnings release documents that are available on the Investor Relations section of the bankofamerica.com website. Brian Moynihan : Thank you, Lee, and good morning to all of you, and thank you for joining us to review our results. It has been an eventful quarter, but I hope all of you are safe and your families are well during this war on the COVID virus. As you think about our quarter, our decade plus long discipline of responsible growth has resulted in us strengthening our balance sheet and making investments in technology and people and talent over the decade has helped us prepare for this environment. Today, we are going to do three things with you. First, I am going to provide a couple high level thoughts on the quarter. Second, I am going to make sure you know how we are supporting our teammates, our customers, our communities and delivering for you, our shareholders, during this crisis. And third, Paul will cover the results in more detail. I will start this discussion by covering the chart on slide two, along with the comments on slide three which go with the chart. Given the volatility in the last couple months and the global slowdown, I am proud of Bank of America and our team\u2019s results. I want to thank my 209,000 teammates across our company for all of their efforts this quarter both in the front-line roles and support functions. It\u2019s been a company-wide effort to continue to serve our customers well during these times. As I said many times, we are in a war against the COVID-19 and at Bank of America we are doing our part to help fight the effects of that war. We do that by living our purpose. We are helping people manage their financial lives through this crisis. My teammates know they are playing a critical role for their clients, whether they are people, whether they are companies of all different sizes and institutional investors. Their role is to help keep the economy moving as best we can during this health care crisis. Their role is -- we have seen major disruption in the financial markets that affected every line of business as customers move to stay-at-home status through voluntary or involuntary measures. Paul Donofrio : Thanks, Brian. Good morning, everyone. I am beginning on slide eight with the balance sheet. Overall compared to the end of Q4 the balance sheet expanded $186 billion, driven by an increase in deposits of $149 billion. Deposit growth in excess of our loan growth was invested primarily in cash or cash equivalents. As Brian mentioned, the team did an incredible job of not only providing our Global Markets clients needed liquidity from a mid-March spike, but also reducing those levels by the end of the quarter. Shareholders\u2019 equity of $265 billion was stable with year-end but included some offsetting factors. AOCI increased $6.5 billion, reflecting several factors, but was driven by a $4.8 billion improvement in the valuation of AFS debt securities. Offsetting this increase to equity were two items. Share repurchases and common dividends of $7.9 billion exceeded our $4 billion of earnings given the reserve build this quarter. And as a reminder, we booked a reduction in equity on January 1 by adopting CECL. Now with respect to CECL, we elected the five-year transition option made available under the fed rule to delay any capital effects of CECL until 2022. The January 1 reserve build plus Q1\u2019s $3.6 billion build equate to a total increase in the reserve of $6.9 billion since year end. Assuming no regulatory relief, including the original relief planned for day one adoption, our CET1 ratio would be 22 basis points lower than we reported. The relief received in late March accounted for 12 basis points of the 22 basis points. As you know, a portion of the CET1 impact of future reserve increases or decreases during the emergency period will also be delayed until 2022. Beginning in Q1 of 2022, we will begin phasing in the 22 basis point reduction for these impacts in equal quarterly amounts through 2025. With respect to our CET1, our CET1 standardized ratio declined 40 basis points to 10.8% driven by a $70 billion increase in RWA. Increases in counterparty risk in Global Markets and increased loan revolvers draws in Global Banking drove the RWA increase. Lastly, our TLAC ratios remain comfortably above our requirement. Given the time constraints of Brian\u2019s point earlier on ending deposits, I will skip the discussion on average deposits on slide eight and move to slide nine, earlier, Brian also discussed our loan growth near the end of the quarter, which was driven by revolver draws, some of that growth affected the growth of average loans presented on slide 10, Q2 should further reflect this late quarter growth. Year-over-year average growth has been consistently in the mid single-digit range and early Q1 trends were similar to that. Note the significant increases across consumer and GWIM, which was driven by residential mortgage given continued low interest rates. This quarter we originated $19 billion in first mortgage loans, retaining 94% on our books. We continue to see good follow-through on our large pipeline but apps are down in the past couple of weeks. I would also note credit card balances, average credit card loans were down a bit more than the typical seasonality, given the drop-off in consumer spending late in the quarter, while customer payment rates continued at a fairly steady pace. Given the significant drop in card spending, we expect card balances to decline further in Q2. Okay. Turning to slide 11 and net interest income. On a GAAP non-FTE basis, NII in Q1 was $12.1 billion, $12.3 billion on an FTE basis and was relatively flat compared to Q4 \u201819. One less day of interest and lower asset yields driven by lower rates negatively impacted NII this quarter. Two primary things offset these negative impacts. First, we saw good loan and deposit growth. Second, lower rates reduced the costs of our long-term debt and improved our funding costs in Global Markets. The lower rates also allowed us to price our deposits more efficiently in Wealth Management and Global Banking. Before I discuss our forward view of NII, I want to emphasize that future NII results will be influenced by interest rates, as well as loan and deposit balances, which will likely be highly influenced by the virus\u2019 impact on the economy. Both of these drivers have been volatile and may continue to be. In terms of the forward guidance, as you know, interest rates dropped significantly over the past 90 days. On the short-end with LIBOR which impacts variable rate loan pricing, as well as longer term rates which impact mortgage and mortgage related assets, have both dropped nearly 80 basis points on a spot basis. As you think about our NII for the rest of the year, I would point you to the asset sensitivity disclosure for our banking book at 12/31 before we experienced these rate declines. Banking book sensitivity from an instantaneous parallel drop of 100 basis points in rate at that time was estimated to reduce NII by $6.5 billion over the following 12 months. Since these rates moved less than 100 basis points, the change in NII over the next 12 months is likely to be less than $6.5 billion.  I would also note some additional items to consider that are expected to mitigate some of that decline. First, we have grown both loans and deposits significantly more than what would have been assumed in that asset sensitivity at year end. Second, our deposit pricing actions have been pretty swift. And last, the asset sensitivity of the banking book does not include the benefits to NII of the trading book, which is a little liability sensitive. With that said, we would expect the largest decline in NII over the balance of 2020 to impact Q2 as the bulk of the repricing of our variable rate loans should happen fairly quickly. Considering all these factors, particularly the virus\u2019 impact on the economy and interest rates, we believe NII could approach $11 billion in Q2 and then begin to stabilize with loan and deposit growth mitigating the negative impacts of longer term asset repricing. Turning to slide 12 and expenses, at $13.5 billion this quarter, expenses were up 2%. They were 2% higher than Q1 2019 as increased investments throughout 2019 in people, real estate and technology initiatives were partially offset by savings from operational excellence initiatives. Compared to Q4 2019, expense increased roughly $250 million, reflecting nearly $400 million and seasonally elevated payroll tax expense. With respect to our outlook, we are still assessing the impacts both positive and negative that the virus has had on the company\u2019s expenses, and as such, are not in a position to provide any updates to our previous expectation that expense would be in the mid-$53 billion range this year. As a reminder, that mid-$53 billion number was before considering the dissolution of our BAMS JV and surrounding actions. With respect to impacts of the pandemic, on the one hand, there are many costs that declined such as travel, meeting costs, lodging, conferences and lower power costs for unused facilities, incentives will align with financial performance and market levels. But on the other hand, as you heard Brian mention earlier, there are costs associated with protecting, supporting and rewarding our employees during this health crisis, including suspending headcount reductions related to COVID for the rest of 2020. We also have costs from the setup, operation and cleaning of backup facilities for trading and other activities. This would include the cost of computers and other supplies and expenses to reposition 150,000 associates to work-from-home. Okay. Turning to asset quality on slide 13. Our underwriting standards have been responsible and strong for years now and we expect this strength to differentiate us as we advance through this health crisis. For years now, we have been focused on client selection and getting paid appropriately for the risk we take. As you all know, what really impacts banks in a recession is not the loans put on your books during stress, but rather the quality of your portfolio booked during the years leading up to stress. One independent indicator of the relative quality of our balance sheet is the Federal Reserve\u2019s annual CCAR stress test. Our net charge-off ratio under those stress tests has been lower than peers in six years of the last seven years. And our consistent focus on asset quality has been reflected in our results for many years now. Adjusted for the recoveries of loan sales in some periods I have described before, we have reported net charge-offs between $900 million and $1 billion for many quarters. Total net charge-offs this quarter were $1.1 billion or 46 basis points of average loans. Net charge-offs rose $163 million from Q4, driven by commercial losses with the largest contribution coming from energy exposure. We saw a small seasonal increase in card losses. Provision expense was $4.8 billion. Our reserve build of $3.6 billion reflects the expected increase in life-of-loan losses, given the weaker current and expected economic conditions as a result of the virus. On slide 14, we break out the credit quality metrics for both consumer and commercial portfolios, Q1 is too early to see any significant effects of COVID on net charge-offs. However, there were a couple of leading indicators of deteriorating asset quality in our commercial portfolio due to the virus as both NPLs and reservable criticized exposures increased. On the consumer front, COVID\u2019s effect on asset quality were less observable. This is likely due to deferral offers extended to consumer borrowers. Moving forward, we believe deferrals coupled with government stimulus for individuals and small businesses should aid in minimizing future losses. Having said that, given the rise in unemployment claims, we do expect consumer losses to increase later this year and potentially into 2021. Turning to slide 15, this table provides a full picture of our allowance increase since 12/31/19, including the 1/1/20 implementation of CECL, as well as this quarter\u2019s build given the worsening economic conditions. As you can see, our allowance including reserves for unfunded commitments was $10.2 billion at year end and now stands at $17.1 billion. That is nearly a $7 billion increase or 67% since year end. Note that we ended Q1 with an allowance to loan and leases of 1.51%. I would also note the increase in the coverage ratio for credit card increased to 8.25% and the coverage ratios for our U.S. commercial and commercial real estate increased to 1.11% and 2.16%, respectively. These ratios reflect our underwriting standards over the past 10 years, as well as our loan mix with the large concentration of secured consumer loans. We size the increase to our allowance in the quarter by weighting a number of different scenarios, all of which assumed a recession of various depth and longevity, including an assumption of some tail risk similar to what is in the severely adverse scenarios. A weighting of these scenarios produced a recessionary outlook, which includes a marked drop in GDP in Q2, growth recovered slowly from there, with negative growth rates in GDP extending well into 2021. Obviously, there are many unknowns, including how governments fiscal and monetary actions will impact the outcome, and how our own deferral programs will impact losses. But perhaps the biggest unknown is how long. How long economic activity and conditions will be significantly impacted by the virus. Okay. Turning to the business segments and starting with Consumer Banking on slide 16. Consumer Banking earned $1.8 billion. Results were impacted by COVID-19 through lower rates, higher provision expense and modest fee reductions. As you know, banking is considered an essential service and across the country, we have kept more than 75% of our financial centers open. In addition, we have added personnel to service calls and manage digital interactions not only with respect to existing products and services, but also on small business applications through the Paycheck Protection Program. Many of these additional personnel are working from home, while net income declined 45% from Q1 2019, it\u2019s worth noting pretax pre-provision income declined 12%. Revenue declined by lower interest rates, as well as the impact of COVID-19, aside from the higher provision costs, consumer fees also reflected modestly lower consumer spending and fee waivers beginning late in the quarter. We continued to invest in the franchise, driving expenses up 3% year-over-year. We added new and renovated financial centers, salespeople and increased minimum wages, plus the additional associates added to service calls, I just mentioned. The expense for these investments continued to be mitigated by process improvements, digitalization and technology improvements. Investments supported continued growth of loans, as well as deposits, as a result, our cost of deposits declined to 150 basis points. Client momentum continued as we saw average deposits increase $40 billion from Q1 \u201819, average loans increased 8% and we continued to add consumer investment accounts and saw solid flows into our Merrill Edge platform. Let\u2019s skip slide 18, as I think I covered much of the trends on slide 17 already. The ability of our customers to connect through digital banking has never been more important. As you can see on slide 18, all aspects of digital engagements continued to increase, with one-third of sales now processed through digital channels, and as you heard that -- and as you heard, that moved higher in the last few weeks of the quarter. We learned a lot from our digital auto and mortgage experiences, and what we learned enabled us to quickly launch a digital pathway for our small businesses to apply for loans in the Paycheck Protection Program. Turning to Wealth -- turning to Global Wealth and Investment Management on slide 19, here again, we saw lower rates and COVID-19 related credit costs impact an otherwise solid quarter. Note the impact of lower market levels in March. Those impacts did not impact Q1 AUM fees as March fees were calculated based upon market levels at the end of February. Merrill Lynch and the Private Bank both continued to grow clients as well as remain a provider of choice for affluent clients. Net income of $866 million was down 17% from Q1 2019, but here again, pretax pre-provision income was down a more modest 4%. Revenue grew 2% year-over-year, as a strong increase in AUM fees and brokerage fees were partially offset by a decline in NII as a result of lower interest rates. Expenses increased from revenue-related incentives, as well as investments we made in the past 12 months in sales professionals, technology and our brand. Okay. Let\u2019s skip slide 20 and move to Global Banking on slide 21. The early impacts of COVID-19 were more evident in this segment. First, the LIBOR fell rapidly in March impacting loan yields. At the same time, revolvers draws didn\u2019t happen until late in the quarter and will likely be more fully reflected in Q2 averages of loans and NII. Lastly, COVID-related credit costs are higher in this segment as the reserve build was more heavily weighted to commercial loans. The business earned $136 million, which included adding $1.9 billion to the allowance for credit losses. On a pretax pre-provision income basis, results declined 21% driven by lower interest rates and by roughly $450 million of net markdowns in the value of loans and underwritten commitments recorded at fair value in our capital markets books and FBO books. On the positive side, in Q1 we were able to improve our investment banking revenue and market share. We generated $1.4 billion in investment banking fees this quarter, a 10% increase year-over-year. In fact, despite a 20% year-over-year decline in the volume of investment banking transactions across all banks, we processed 9% more transactions in Q1 than the previous year. Growth in investment banking fees, loans and deposits reflected not only what we believe to be a flight to quality in uncertain times, but also the addition of hundreds of bankers over the past few years increasing and improving client coverage.  Turning to slide 22, Brian covered the most important points around loan and deposit growth, I just want to reiterate one point. We believe companies viewed us as a safe haven in this period of stress. Quarter-over-quarter on an ending basis, deposits increased $94 billion, while loans increased $58 billion. Not only were we able to capture as deposits, the bulk of the cash that customers drew on the revolvers that wasn\u2019t used to pay down debt or for other purposes. We were also able to attract billions more in additional deposits even as pricing deposits lower with falling rates. Turning to slide 23, as in consumer and GWIM, our digital capabilities are more important and useful than ever, enabling clients to work-from-home and seamlessly manage their treasury needs. And it\u2019s no surprise that in this environment, we continue to see increased use of these capabilities. Switching to Global Markets on slide 24, as I usually do, I will talk about results excluding DVA. Despite the volatility experienced in the quarter, Global Markets produced $1.5 billion of earnings in Q1, a 34% increase year-over-year. Year-over-year revenue was up 15% from both higher sales and trading results, and improved investment banking fees. Expense was up a more modest 2% year-over-year on higher related -- revenue related costs. Within revenue, sales and trading improved 22% year-over-year, driven by a 39% improvement in equities and a 13% increase in FICC in a significantly more volatile market environment when compared to Q1 last year. FICC revenue reflected better trading performance across macro products, offsetting weaker performance in credit sensitive products resulting from widening credit spreads, which impacted asset prices. Equity revenue of $1.7 billion was a record for the company. All right, skipping slide 25 and moving to All Other on slide 26. All Other reported a loss of $492 million. The loss reflects approximately $500 million for several valuation reductions including marks on derivative positions and certain noncore securities, which were impacted by wider spreads toward the end of the quarter. Our effective tax rate this quarter was 11.5%. It included the impact of a fairly normal level of tax credits from our commitment to sustainable energy products and other ESG efforts, many of which are tax advantaged. Applying this fairly normal level of tax credits against a lower pretax earnings base resulted in a lower tax rate, it\u2019s just math. For the full year, I would expect the ETR to be in a range of 14% to 15%. Okay. With that, I think, we will open it up to questions. Operator :  We will take our first question today from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead your line open. Betsy Graseck : Hi. Good morning. Thank you very much for all the detailed insight, in particular your slide that talked about the percentage of folks who have been asking for deferrals is extremely interesting, as well as the detail on the reserving analysis. My question has to do with how you thought about that reserving analysis. I know we have been through stress tests here for 10 years now and it would just be helpful to understand how you decided to size the very significant increase in the reserve and how you think it trajects from here? Brian Moynihan : Paul, why don\u2019t you hit that, please. Paul Donofrio : Yeah. Sure. So let me ask the last part -- answer the last part first. We put a reserve on our balance sheet that we think reflects the information that we had at the end of Q1. And so in terms of what\u2019s going to happen in the future, that reserve is going to go up or down based upon the facts and circumstances and our view of the future when we get to the end of Q2. I think when you think about reserves, you have got to really focus on loan mix and the quality of the portfolio and then you have the added variable under CECL of everybody coming up with a view of the future. We sized our reserve build in Q1 by weighting the number of economic scenarios, all of which assumed a recession of various depth and longevity, and that included assuming some tail risk similar to what\u2019s in the severely adverse scenarios. So when we weighted the scenarios that produced a -- clearly a recessionary outlook, which included a significant drop in GDP in the second quarter with negative GDP growth rates extending well into 2021. We also considered the impact of various groups of credits and stressed industries. And while small relative to the impact of scenario weighting, we incrementally factored that analysis into the sizing of our reserve build. Obviously, there are many unknowns including how government, fiscal and monetary actions will impact the outcome, but we can try to consider that as well. We also had to consider how our own deferral programs will impact losses. But perhaps the biggest unknown is how long economic activities and conditions will be significantly impacted by the virus. Brian Moynihan : So, Betsy, I might add a couple things. If you sort of benchmark, this has nothing to do with setting under GAAP, it\u2019s just sort of, okay, now you have it, let\u2019s look at it. I think we are about 65% of last year\u2019s fed supervisory severely adverse total losses type of numbers. That\u2019s one way to think about it. As you -- and then another thing to think about is the construct of the portfolios. Those of you like yourself who have been around our company a lot, I went back and started saying sort of are we sure how much different we are and people forget things that won\u2019t mean a lot to people on the phone, the gold option program, which was a restructuring of card debt that went on in the mid-2000s, it started to go into the crisis in 2008 time frame at $25 billion, eight quarters later, six quarters later, something like that, it\u2019s down to 12, half of that was charge-off. There\u2019s none of that around now and so it\u2019s not only the FICO scores and all of the things that you have, it\u2019s also that there\u2019s pieces of the portfolio that cost us a lot in the last crisis that aren\u2019t there. But let me -- and that\u2019s just how we positioned the portfolio. So even some of the industries which people -- we are focused on as a credit grantor and you are focused on as an analyst are relatively 1% in this industry or that industry, so the list is sort of concerning industries entertainment, travel, things like that, we have low exposures to because of diversity of mix of portfolio. You touched on the deferrals and let me just give you a couple perspectives on that. One, on that small business, as I mentioned earlier the reason why it\u2019s high is there\u2019s a lot of doctors and dentists in there and you would expect that they would pay. But to give you a sense, before their deferral, 95%, 97%, 98% of these people were current under all of the measures and so they are not people who were struggling. They were people who are current just needed a hiatus due to their change. The FICO scores for 90%-plus of the mortgage deferrals, 95%-plus on the cards, again, about 90%, 85%, I guess, are 600 or better, so the average FICO is almost 700 of the deferral. So you would expect that people who have deferred are doing it as a matter of convenience and will get back in the flow once the economy reopens. And so the LTVs on the mortgage is again 95% or under -- only 5% or 10% are really the FHA, VA of the deferred program and they are 95% are better, all the rest of it\u2019s low. It\u2019s 75% of its below 80% LTV and stuff. So these are core people who have had a change and we would expect to start to perform. So we will see how it plays out but it\u2019s very different I think than past deferral statuses we have had. Betsy Graseck : It\u2019s a very impressive reserve ratio, and in addition, your CET1 stayed relatively high this quarter as well. I just wanted to ask a follow-up, Brian, around how you are thinking about the dividend, it\u2019s been question that many investors have been asking and maybe you can give us a sense as to how you think through that question? Brian Moynihan : Let me just, Lee has corrected me. It\u2019s 65% of the adverse, not severely adverse, I think, is what Lee is telling me. We are in two different locations, so usually he can wave at me when I have made a mistake. But in terms of the dividend, we kept the dividend payout ratio below 30% of the sort of normalized earnings level and we did it for a reason that one of our operating principles is we wanted to maintain a dividend. And given what we know, we have earned twice the dividend this quarter at $0.40 versus $0.18 payout ratio and we expect that to continue and that shows you the 100-plus basis points, 130 basis points of excess capital. We have tested it lots of ways as you might expect, as we talked to our Board about capital management, as we talked to our Board about dividends. On any given time, we are showing them severely adverse cases, adverse cases and thinking through the pretax PPNR capability of withstanding different reserve builds and outcomes and so that\u2019s what we are doing and trying to keep it going. Betsy Graseck : Thank you. Operator : We will go now to John McDonald with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead. John McDonald : Yeah. Hi. Just a quick follow-up on that, Paul, I know you mentioned in terms of the macro assumptions it\u2019s a weighted average, but what you described is kind of a 2Q deep dive in GDP and then continuing negative for the rest of the year. Is that kind of the central case, is there any more details you could provide on that as we compare different banks and what macro assumptions are embedded into the reserve, it\u2019s helpful to know the kind of the maybe central case of assumptions? Thank you. Paul Donofrio : Yeah. I mean, just to be clear, what I said was, it\u2019s a significant drop in GDP in the second quarter and then negative GDP growth to extend well into 2021, I think, approaching all the way to the end of the year. So we view it as a recessionary outlook. We wouldn\u2019t describe it any other way. None of the scenarios that we are looking at are anything other than a recession, and again, we have captured sort of the tail risk of a severely adverse situation. In terms of providing -- yeah, go ahead. John McDonald : No. No. Go ahead, please. Paul Donofrio : I was going to say in terms of providing specifics on one variable or another, you have got a lot of variables that go into these models, many, many, many variables and so we really believe that to provide that level of detail could be a little misleading. It\u2019s -- unless you have the full context of all the factors that we considered when we set the allowance, picking one or the other and starting to compare here or there just to us I think would be misleading. Plus, very importantly, the impact of all those multiple inputs that go into the process will be different from each bank depending upon the bank\u2019s loan mix and very importantly the quality of the loan portfolio that they have been putting on the books for years. I think, Brian, just sort of talked about it, but I will say it again, we have been very focused on prime and super prime customer borrowers for many years now. So the impacts to us of all those inputs is going to be different, and I guess, that\u2019s what all the information I would want to give you about like one input or another. Hopefully that helps you in terms of how we think about it. John McDonald : Yeah. And the reference point to CCAR is helpful too. It sounds like what you provided for built into the reserve is about 60% of the cumulative losses from the fed\u2019s adverse\u2026 Paul Donofrio : Yeah. John McDonald : \u2026in 2019? Paul Donofrio : Yeah. Again, as Brian said, that\u2019s more of an output, not an input, right? We are developing scenarios based upon the information we had at the end of the quarter. But it is interesting and it\u2019s maybe helpful for all of you in terms of comparing reserves to really think about the loan mix, the quality of the portfolio and then, of course, what people assumed about the future. But in terms of the loan mix and the quality of the portfolio, there is an independent view out there. There\u2019s an independent view every year. And so if you look at our losses in the severely adverse -- the fed\u2019s stress test, our losses under the severely adverse or our losses under the adverse and then you look at our reserve and you divide by those losses, you are going to get percentages that are in the range or better than what you are seeing across the industry. John McDonald : Okay. Got it. Thank you. Paul Donofrio : And remember those tests basically are an independent way to evaluate the quality of somebody\u2019s portfolio and the mix of somebody\u2019s portfolio. So we think, again, we didn\u2019t size it that way, but we think that\u2019s an interesting way for you to kind of get some sort of independent perspective on allowances. John McDonald : Yeah. I think it\u2019s helpful for us to compare across banks that way. Thank you. Paul Donofrio : You still have the issue, though, by the way, that every bank is going to have a -- this is the first quarter we are all doing CECL and everybody is going to have to develop their own view of the future. And there\u2019s no evidence right now that you can point to of asset degradation. There\u2019s a little bit of NPLs and a little bit of reserved criticized. So we are all doing this based upon just our view of the future based upon all those inputs that we use in our models. John McDonald : Got it. Operator : We will go now to Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Mike Mayo : Hey, Paul. Same question, maybe more specifically, how much more could reserve\u2026 Paul Donofrio : Same answer, Mike. Mike Mayo : Same answer? Paul Donofrio : Yeah. Mike Mayo : Well, just how much -- I mean, how much more could the reserves get built in the second quarter and then when you define a significant drop in GDP, how do you define significant? I mean, look -- I mean, the stock pre-market looks like it\u2019s going to open down 6% or 7%, if my numbers are right? And you just guided for better NII and you earned your dividend at least two times, up to four times, depending on how you compute, your book value grew. You have good capital ratios. You have the balance sheet strength to take the additional charges. So why not just take it for like the worst case that you are allowed to do so and communicate that and say all right, your capital is still fine. So you had one of your peers kind of telegraph that. You seem to be hesitant to do so, given all of the different variables, I understand. But can you give us any a little bit more guidance for reserve builds say in the second quarter or the third quarter? Paul Donofrio : Yeah. Yeah. Sure. Again, like you said, we have the liquidity, we have the capital on our reserve build if you look at independent perspectives from the fed or other sources, our reserve bill as a percentage of future losses under multiple scenarios that they publish is higher or in the range of our competitors. So that\u2019s a lot of information for you right there. In terms of your question about, hey, what\u2019s the likely reserve build in the future? If we thought we were going to have to add more reserve build in the future, we would have put it into this quarter. That\u2019s how the rules work. You reserve for your expected lifetime losses. So our reserve build reflects what we think as of the end of the quarter we are going to have to have in losses for the life of the assets on our books. Now when we get to the end of the second quarter, we may have a different view of the future and so we may release reserves or we may increase reserves. The quality of our loan book won\u2019t change that much because that doesn\u2019t change that much in the quarter. The mix doesn\u2019t change that much because that doesn\u2019t change in the quarter. We have built this loan book based upon years, years of underwriting standards. And so it will go down -- the reserve will go down in the second quarter or go up in the second quarter, but it will be based upon a change in our outlook on the future. Mike Mayo : Got it. If I could follow-up with Brian then, I mean, clearly, the biggest input is when does the economy come back online. And Brian, you and your firm have as many touch points nationally as anybody. There must be some underlying thought process that goes into the reserve build and the losses about when the economy comes back online, kind of what\u2019s your base case, best case, bad scenario, what are you seeing, what are your thoughts? Brian Moynihan : Well, one thing that is different, Mike, and you well know is when our authority embedded in governors, the mayors, and the President to tell us what to do is overriding here. So we could have a view of what can happen, but given the healthcare crisis as opposed to demand changes and things that would be out of the general economic flow or credit risk because commercial real estate got overvalued. The things that we have dealt with in our lifetimes as you have dealt with, this is just different. So we have to remind ourselves always this is going to come down to solving this healthcare crisis and is number one. Just to give you some facts of where we stand and we will see this play out. As I said earlier, if you look at sort of the weekly flow of payments across all of means, cash being taken out of the ATMs and spent through checks written through ACH wires and credit and debit card. That was around $65 billion a week in January/February and now it\u2019s running $50 -- like $51 billion, $52 billion average for the last couple weeks. But you are seeing that rate of decline flatten at this point and if you go and look at geographies based on the data we see, we have seen it sort of flatten. So you are seeing what might be a relatively -- and that\u2019s after the unemployment claims have been filed and we are seeing the unemployment come into the accounts. You are seeing a rate of -- the rate of declines sort of flatten and then as you look at it sort of compared to the rate of decline year-over-year by week and things like that and different types of industries. They have gotten to the bottom in some, travel or entertainment, you have gotten to a more sustainable maybe in drug stores and grocery stores and you sort of see the economy running at that level. And so that would imply whatever the 10% over the 16%, 15%, 16% decline. That will hold on. We will watch, but right now that seems to be holding on, the places have been shutdown longer and we will see that play out as it goes forward to see if that starts to grow from there. Remember, gas prices are down a lot and gas usage is down a lot. That impacts those numbers also. So we are looking for those signs. I am not saying we have anything yet. We are looking for those signs. We are also looking for how the unemployment affects our customer base and so we have seen as households that we have as unemployment one of the participants of the household we have a lot of dual earning households. 75% of the households that we have who have received unemployment also have someone receiving a regular paycheck still. And so those types of things will be interesting to see it play out if that would change in behavior in terms of what people spend on versus a real crisis in the household because of one wage earner. We will figure that out. So we are seeing balances in households especially among the moderately affluent grow in terms of checking account balances because people are spending less and storing cash. We see it on the Wealth Management side people can delay paying their taxes. So all these factors will play in, it\u2019s just a little premature to call anything, Mike, and so that\u2019s the factors we are looking at as we look at not only to your point about how you said potential losses based on our customer base and their behavior and what happens to them, but also based on our view of the economy opening up. And frankly, our advice to people who want as to what parts of the economy could have a faster impact with less, they are the healthcare experts, but less risk of people congregating versus others that might help support a reopening or get activity. Go back to the dentist or something like that. You could put dentists back to work. That will open up part of the economy that is usually not closed down for these things and it\u2019s a relatively few number of people in a given space or given time. So I will leave it to healthcare experts to make those judgments, but all that\u2019s going to come together. As we move through the quarter, we will try to give you better insight, but right now that\u2019s what we are seeing. Mike Mayo : All right. So that\u2019s why you say reserves could go up or they could be relieved, you just don\u2019t know yet? Brian Moynihan : Yeah. I mean, it\u2019s just -- that\u2019s -- people are -- we all want to see where the end is, you included, Mike, we do too, but the question is we have got to wait for some time to pass to have a feel for that. Mike Mayo : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Glenn Schorr : Hello. Thanks very much. Maybe one more quickie on allowance and reserves. When I look at the healthy reserve on card, it makes sense given the macro backdrop we are looking at and unemployment and kind of the linear relationship with unemployment and card. If you look at say U.S. commercial and non-U.S. commercial in and around 1%, that\u2019s obviously a lot more than we have had lately, but not necessarily the worst thing you could predict given the world we are looking at. So I guess my question is when you talk about the quality and the mix of business, and all of the things that you gave us. Is the -- what I consider the -- not as severe reserve on the commercial side assumption of not knowing the timing, the mix of business or is it where you sit in the capital, meaning even if some of those companies run into issues, your historical experience in the last bunch of years has been actually really, really good. So I know it\u2019s probably all of those, but I am just trying to see if you could talk towards that on the commercial side? Paul Donofrio : Look, we have got $2.16 billion on commercial real estate. Given how we have run our commercial real estate business over the last 10 years, especially relative to others. We feel that\u2019s up from $1.6 billion at January 1. We have got $1.11 billion on U.S. commercial. Those commercial losses, they just don\u2019t run as high because of collateral and other protections we have in the structure. So we feel pretty good. If you look at total commercial, we are at $1.16 billion. So we feel good about where we are. And again, it\u2019s when you sort of add all of that up and you just look at it relative to the losses that people are projecting including the fed, whether it\u2019s an adverse scenario or it\u2019s an adverse scenario, you are going to come out with percentages that are pretty healthy on an absolute basis and relative to our peers. Brian Moynihan : And Glenn, I\u2019d add one thing. Let\u2019s go back to the beginning on the pretax PP&R, which we all learned after the last crisis. But that earnings power to absorb pay as you go losses on the consumer side in terms of card charge-offs and things like that or building reserves and then going through on the commercial side, which is what happens typically. That earnings power is I think what we feel has us in good stead in terms of the ability to absorb whatever circumstances play out here and still -- with more liquidity than the start of the year, more capital than we need, 130 basis points more capital and the PP&R volume that lets us drive through it. And if you think about that PP&R when you look at the stress test and stuff, we are running a lot higher than the stress test assumed, because they assume there\u2019s market losses and things like that, which we didn\u2019t experience even in the most volatile periods of time in the markets history.  And so I think as you play this out that -- whether we can all talk about the reserve of X or Y or Z per thing, which is what you all are focused on and should be focused on, the reality is how much earnings capacity you have to keep generating capital and keep generating earnings that you can offset whatever comes at you and that\u2019s what we feel good about. Paul Donofrio : That\u2026 Glenn Schorr : Thank you both. Paul Donofrio : If you study that portfolio, remember, it\u2019s mostly investment grade. And if you look at it the other way around, if you looked at the amount of loans or revolvers that we have in leveraged finance, private equity sponsored leveraged loans, for example. That\u2019s less than 1% of total exposures. We don\u2019t have any CLO exposures because we don\u2019t put any of that in our ALM portfolio. We have got a fraction a tiny bit in Global Markets for trading purposes, so that we -- that commercial portfolio is relatively high-grade. Glenn Schorr : Great detail. I appreciate it. Thank you. Operator : We will go now to Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Vivek Juneja : Just\u2026 Brian Moynihan : Hello? Paul Donofrio : You still there, Vivek? Is it us? Operator : Vivek, we are not able to hear you at this time. Please check the mute function on your phone. Brian Moynihan : Operator, let\u2019s move on to the next one. We will pick him up later. Operator : We will go now to Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Matt O\u2019Connor: Good morning. The NII guidance, obviously, helpful and coming off a much better than expected 1Q, just wonder if you can give a little more detail in terms of I assume some of the sharp drop is higher bond premium amortization, lower trading, and then, obviously, kind of coordinate pressure, is how I think about the three buckets. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s right or you want to parse it differently, but any additional color would be helpful? Thanks. Brian Moynihan : Yeah. I mean, we did see bond premium amortization in Q1 is always sort of seasonally low or lower. We do expect an increase in Q2, given the decline in rates in Q1. You have got to remember that prepayments generally lag moves in NII or they proceed moves in NII -- the rate move proceed NII impact by six weeks to eight weeks. What else did you ask about? Matt O\u2019Connor: I assume trading benefit 1Q\u2026 Brian Moynihan : Yeah. Matt O\u2019Connor: \u2026and is being factored in and then just kind of\u2026 Brian Moynihan : Yeah. Matt O\u2019Connor: \u2026call it pressure from the rate environment is the third bucket? Brian Moynihan : Yeah. Yeah. Trading definitely, we are liability sensitive in Global Markets. But it\u2019s not a huge impact and it can bounce around quarter-to-quarter depending upon the type of assets that they are booking and whether they bought them at par or above or below par. That influences whether profits show up or revenue shows up in NII or shows up in market making or similar activities. So we -- that\u2019s why we don\u2019t give guidance on it because it can change pretty rapidly depending on what they are buying and selling for clients in Global Markets. But right now, it was a little bit liability sensitive and did help a little bit in Q1 and it will probably help a little bit in Q2. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay. And then as we think about the balancing growth component, obviously, 2Q average balances will benefit from the run-up on a period end in 1Q. But I would think as you kind of look to the back half this year and beyond, some of those line draw downs in commercial start to get paid off, so that maybe it\u2019s tougher to grow the balance sheet or at least tougher to grow loans? I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s the right way to think about it? Brian Moynihan : Yeah. I mean, there\u2019s no question that commercial revolver lines which spiked in March, will start to pay down once economic conditions start to improve. But obviously the timing of that is very uncertain. So I think we are just going to have to wait and see. Clearly, we are going to see some carry over from these draws in Q2 and we may see a very significant amount stay with us for some time, we will just have to wait and see. Obviously, deposit balances also benefit NII because you don\u2019t necessarily have to make a loan. You can earn on those deposit balances and they are way up as well and they may be with us for a little while, we will just have to wait and see. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay. And just last quickie. Brian Moynihan : Just so our NII guidance, I am not going to get into the details, but our NII guidance, of course, assumes some sort of runoff. We are making some sort of guesses at this point about what the runoff would be in both loan and deposits. Matt O\u2019Connor: Yeah. Understood. And then, just lastly, a quick one on the spread of the commercial lines draw downs, any rough numbers on that, I am often asked that question. Brian Moynihan : Yeah. Sure. The spread on the draw downs were no different than what they were pre-crisis because they are just draw downs. They are existing arrangements. We worked with some clients to adjust the liquidity we were giving them. There were a few new loans in there that were at higher spreads, but most of the spreads were the same as were spreads pre-crisis. So you are not going to get a spread benefit on those draws. Matt O\u2019Connor: Maybe like a LIBOR\u2026 Brian Moynihan : I think. Matt O\u2019Connor: \u2026plus 150 or 200? Brian Moynihan : Well, given the quality of our loan book, I wouldn\u2019t go as high as LIBOR plus 150. Matt O\u2019Connor: Got it. Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks so much. Paul Donofrio : In terms of who drew. Brian Moynihan : Yeah. In terms of who drew. Yeah. Matt O\u2019Connor: Great. Paul Donofrio : Yeah. But one thing, just to back up, there will be a transitory impact we should all hope of these draws and stuff. And that means more stability in the market, more reopening of the economy. So but what isn\u2019t transitory is the good core work that went on in our Consumer business and our Wealth Management business and the treasury services, the core growth levels that will continue through even if the deposits that people have built go back into other forms or get used up. And so I think that\u2019s going to be the trick, for a little while, we will all going to be pre-occupied with the pace of those loans dropping off, et cetera. But the reality is over the long-term we are going to be based more on the way that underlying has performed going into this/ And frankly, the amount of activity that can continue in the underlying business given this COVID virus situation and we -- our officers are making contact. Our wealth managers, we are continuing to add accounts in various businesses, not at the rate that you would before. But -- because just necessarily is not face-to-face meetings taking place, but you are seeing the Wealth Management contacts are up. You are seeing even the referrals between our lines of businesses continue. It\u2019s just at a lower rate because of the necessities of the face-to-face meeting limitations, but those will come back as soon as we can get back in action. Operator : We will go now to Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead. Brian Kleinhanzl : Yeah. Good morning. Quick question, I know you commented on the consumer deferrals that you were seeing. But what\u2019s kind of been the trends on the corporate side as well and kind of what\u2019s been the inbound with regards to using some of these government programs from your clients out there? Brian Moynihan : In terms of the government programs? Brian Kleinhanzl : Correct. Brian Moynihan : We have -- yeah. We -- yeah, 12 days ago, we started taking applications in the PPP program. We have had hundreds of thousands of applications. We are processing them in accordance with the guidance that was given by treasury to get the work done and then submit them, thousands have been through the SBA and have a number and we have thousands -- many thousands in the hands of clients that are signing promissory notes and we are funding them. So that is still, I think, for the whole industry the real impact economic of the money traveling out is coming, will come over the next period of time here. Today, we received the first major distribution of the direct payments in terms of the $1,200 stimulus payment types. We are seeing now the unemployment benefits, the extra $600 type thing coming through and the benefit structures we are seeing in the -- programs we are seeing both as we service the state as a provider of prepaid card type -- card access to those programs and we see in our accounts. So those programs are just barely hitting the general consumer, general business, et cetera, in term -- for us and for the industry. Our industry peers are all in the same condition. And so they will provide the stimulus they will provide is actually going to be from now on, not from now backwards, because this is a program that didn\u2019t exist literally three weeks ago, only started two weeks -- 12 days ago and several hundred thousand people applied for it and we are processing through it as fast as we can and it\u2019s around 10,000, 12,000 on the more commercial banking side. Brian Kleinhanzl : Just a separate question, I know you have built a big qualitative reserve now with CECL. But kind of what are your expectations with regards to how the charge-offs will roll through given all of the deferrals that are going on, forbearance which could push potential charge-offs out to a year or more. Are you really looking that you may not see much of an uptick this year and it could really be 2021 before you start to see meaningful degradation in the charge-offs? Thanks. Brian Moynihan : Yeah. So I -- yeah, the total amounts as you saw on page five of the balance of deferrals. So if you go to the inverse of that 95% and we see of the cards are not deferred and they will pay us and stuff. So I think the question is what really happens, to your point, so we deferred somebody whose 750 FICO who temporarily thought lost their job or thought they were going to lose their job and just wanted a month, that will come back. And so I think the losses will shake out from the -- into the fall, because just the methodology is you remember, it\u2019s to the 180 days you have to roll through all the buckets and stuff. So we will see it play out, but it\u2019s going to be delayed. But remember, because the CECL, you are providing for your expected outcome under that delay, and Paul gave you the parameters of what we talked about already. So the question is that\u2019s what we are putting up at the end of the first quarter and we will get the second quarter we will put it up and third quarter all based on what we think the credit costs will be of that portfolio over the cycle that\u2019s ahead of us, down into the trough and back out the other side in a very slow matter, as Paul described. And then the real question will be\u2026 Brian Kleinhanzl : Yeah. Brian Moynihan : \u2026sort of people\u2019s behavior given these government programs and the amount of extra cash going in and then on the employment, the PPP program is employ people and pay people, you get two -- eight weeks of pay to pay them out and so we will see how that all metes out to the underlying people. But so I think it\u2019s premature, but I think it will delay charge-offs, but our reserve at any given moment reflect what we think will ultimately happen to those customers, not when it will happen. Brian Kleinhanzl : Okay. Thanks. Operator : And we will go now to Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Ken Usdin : Hey. Thanks a lot. Hey, Paul, just a couple of follow-ups on the NII front for you. With LIBOR expanding versus fed funds and the TED spread still wide, which typically happens obviously in times of stress. How are you expecting that to traject as you talk about your $11 billion number and just your expectation for rates in the long end of the curve? Paul Donofrio : Yeah. So we are basically factoring in a timing between LIBOR and fed funds over the year. But we are also factoring in some loan and deposit growth offsetting that. And then, of course, we have got securities and other assets maturing that we are going to replace at a lower yield and all that\u2019s factored into our perspective that we think with loan and deposit growth, we can -- you will see NII kind of at that $11 billion level give or take roughly through the end of the year. Ken Usdin : So when you -- with all of the cash that\u2019s sitting on the balance sheet and like you said earlier, you are expecting some tapering of that. How -- what is the asset liability decision about what to invest and what you are putting it in, and so, like, what\u2019s the kind of go-to investment rate versus what\u2019s coming off? Paul Donofrio : Well, right now, that liquidity -- that excess liquidity that all came flooding in is in cash and we will have to think about what we want to do that with that excess liquidity as it becomes clearer kind of how long it\u2019s going to stick around. If -- right now, if you just look at what\u2019s in our securities portfolio and compare to the yields available to reinvest, they would be 50 basis points lower. But all that\u2019s kind of factored into our guidance. Ken Usdin : Right. And one more question on the deposit side. Can you just talk about across the businesses, what you are seeing from customers in terms of money coming out of the markets and whether it\u2019s sitting in money market mutual funds in Wealth Management or whether its moved on to the balance sheet and just kind of how that ties into your ability to re-price deposits? Thanks. Brian Moynihan : Just to start on that, just generally customers put more cash and you saw that in the Wealth Management deposits being up $19 billion. So that reflects not only the moving money but also the reallocation in our models and things like that. So you have seen that. We have seen them stabilize. My guess is two-thirds of that was more what you are speaking about a third or so was sort of the core growth building up that we saw coming into the tail end of last year into the quarter maybe or a little less than that. But a lot of it was moving and it will move back in the markets based on the allocations and methods and in terms of deposit forms of the markets. And then on the money funds, the allocations reflected there, because of the prime money funds versus the government money funds, there\u2019s a lot of instability around that towards the quarter. So I think this will all settle out and you will see it return to more normal when people are thinking about that. So you will see less volume growth in the balance sheet deposit driven than Wealth Management. Paul Donofrio : I am not sure what else I would add to that, obviously, we brought deposit pricing down, in Q1, you can see that in the average by product. They are going to come down further just based upon pricing actions that we have already taken that are just now rolling -- are going to start rolling into those average deposit pricing across the different types of products. In terms of growth, we ultimately saw very strong growth in Q1. There\u2019s a lot of moving pieces there, so it\u2019s hard to give guidance on growth from here. I just would emphasize, what Brian emphasized earlier that the underlying spike in deposits. If you look beneath that underlying spike, we still saw solid core organic growth across all our LOBs in January and February. In terms of the second quarter, with respect to consumer, you are going to have government stimulus and delayed tax payments. That\u2019s going to be a tailwind. June clients, we will just have to see they shifted out of investments into deposits. We are going to have to see how that plays out over time. And then Global Banking, we already discussed the large deposit inflows in March, ending deposits grew $94 billion quarter-over-quarter. As the markets stabilize and economic activity returns, we do expect some component of those deposit balances to flow out over time as clients pay down their lines to pay other bills and redeploy liquidity. So we have kind of factored all that in, but at this point there\u2019s a lot of uncertainty. Ken Usdin : Yeah. Understood. Thanks a lot. Operator : And we will take our final question today from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Vivek Juneja : Sorry about that earlier. But let me just jump in and not hold everybody up that much. In your loan draw downs, you said 90% investment grade. What percentage of those were BBB minus and what are you thinking as you reserve how many of those are more vulnerable or more at risk of downgrades? Paul Donofrio : All well over 90% were investment grade or secured. I don\u2019t have how many were BBB minus in front of me. Vivek Juneja : Yeah. Okay. And going back to, I know just looking at the reserve build, sorry to go back to that, but it is the question of the day. On your -- you have talked about GDP staying negative well into 2021. Can you give some color on what you are thinking in terms of unemployment? How high do you see your weighted-average in 2021, if that\u2019s the case? Paul Donofrio : No. Look, as I said before, we are not really providing level -- that level of detail because we think comparisons on this input versus that input were -- when there\u2019s 30 or 40 inputs in the models is going to be misleading unless you have a full context of all factors. Vivek Juneja : Right. Okay. Paul Donofrio : Okay. Vivek Juneja : Okay. Another one and small business, the deferrals that you have seen so far probably going to rise, what are you thinking in terms of as you have done your reserving, what percentage of those ultimately may not make it at this point? Brian Moynihan : Vivek, if you are listen\u2026 Vivek Juneja : If that -- what is\u2026 Brian Moynihan : If you were listening earlier\u2026 Vivek Juneja : I have been trying, Brian, too many calls this morning all at the same time. Brian Moynihan : That\u2019s right. A substantial part of those small business are in clinical practice solutions which are doctors and dentists and things like that. And you expect once they open their practice they will pay because they don\u2019t want to lose their equipment practice. So it\u2019s a little different than the general small business that have and that\u2019s why that number is elevated just because of who the dominance that portfolio as a percentage of the total. So if we expect a lot of it will come back and we will play that -- see that play out as parts of the economy reopen. Thank you, Vivek. And we are going to move to close here because we have got an endpoint at 10. And so let me just close quickly. Thank you all of you for your time this morning. Number one, please keep your families and yourselves safe as we go through the rest of this health crisis. Simply put, we earned $4 billion. We added substantially to our reserves based on our view at the end of the quarter. Our capital ratio is 130 basis points over our minimums. The liquidity is increased during the quarter. But importantly, we drove responsible growth, supported our teammates, our clients and our communities and delivered, I think, for the shareholders too, given the circumstances that were going on. As we look forward, we will continue to keep you apprised of what we are seeing on our client base due to our purview. And as we see that, we will continue to try to keep people informed to help people understand how the company and the economy might operate given the stay-at-home orders. Thank you for your time and we will talk to you next quarter. Operator : This does conclude today\u2019s program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.",

Later, you will have the opportunity to ask questions during the question-and-answer session.  Please note today's call is being recorded. It is my pleasure now to turn the conference over to Lee McEntire. Please go ahead. Lee McEntire : Good morning. Thanks for joining the call to review our second quarter results. I trust everybody has had a chance to review our earnings release documents. They're available on the Investor Relations section of the bankofamerica.com website. Brian Moynihan : Thank you, Lee, and thank all of you for joining us for our results. As I step back and thought about talking to you this quarter, I thought back to our discussion of last quarter's results. In mid-April, as we were talking, we sat in the depths of the COVID-19 crisis. We saw -- we're seeing a rise in virus cases. We completed a massive move in our company and companies around the world to work from home. We're closing branches for safety and other facilities. We had 1 million customers that had already approached us by mid-April asking for assistance in terms of paying their loans. We've seen a massive amount of commercial line draws in mid-March to mid-April and loan requests out of panic and the need to create instant liquidity. And as the -- we saw a flood of deposits looking for a safe haven at the same time. Yet at that time, the core economic projections were still catching up to the worsening predictions of the future and the reality of the health officials' projections of the virus path and the reality of shut down and state-at-home orders. And now we're a quarter later. In some areas, the cases are still rising and some areas are rising less. Economic predictions have been revised and the forward path has deteriorated from last quarter. Baseline projections now extend the length of the recessionary environment into 2022 deep into 2022. We provide substantial additional reserves for expected future credit losses this quarter to reflect that and that has impacted our earnings. On the other hand, there has been some encouraging signs. Consumer spending activity has vastly improved since April. Spending by Bank of America consumers during 2019 was a total of $3 trillion, so it's a sizable sample of U.S. activity. For the month of April that spending was down 26% compared to April of 2019. However, for the month of June that spending was relatively flat to 2019. And so far through the first couple of weeks of July, we're seeing that total spending actually be above what it was last year. Paul Donofrio : Thank you, Brian. I'm going to start on slide 11 with the balance sheet. Our balance sheet ended the quarter at $2.7 trillion in total assets increasing $122 billion since the end of Q1, driven by a surge in deposits. During Q2, deposits grew by $135 billion, while loans declined by $52 billion as commercial borrowers repaid much of their lines. Excess liquidity continued to be invested predominantly in cash and cash equivalents. Shareholders' equity increased modestly as earnings exceeded distributions to shareholders. With respect to regulatory ratios for the past two years our CET1 ratio under the standardized approach has been binding, but this quarter the ratio under the advanced approach is lower and therefore binding. Our CET1 ratio under the standardized approach improved 80 basis points linked quarter to 11.6%, primarily driven by an $86 billion decline in RWA. This RWA decline was mainly driven by commercial loan paydowns, as well as lower credit card balances. In addition, we earlier adopted the Standardized Approach for Counterparty Credit Risk aka SA-CCR for derivatives. Our CET1 ratio under the advanced approach improved to 11.4% as RWA under advanced declined modestly. Also this quarter, we received our preliminary Stress Capital Buffer or SCB from the Federal Reserve pursuant to our CCAR results. Our stress depletion was approximately 150 basis points and including the dividend add-on, our SCB was a little under 2%. However, as you know SCBs are floored at 2.5%. So our minimum standardized and advanced CET1 requirement is 9.5% and remained unchanged. The capital cushion above our 9.5% CET1 minimum was $28 billion at quarter end. The CET1 ratio under the advanced approach became our binding ratio primarily due to the impact on RWA of the migration of corporate credit risk ratings under the advanced approach. Our TLAC ratios increased and remained comfortably above our minimum requirements. Turning to slide 12, net interest income. On a GAAP non-FTE basis, NII in Q2 was $10.8 billion, $11 billion on an FTE basis. Net interest income declined $1.3 billion for both Q1 2020 as well as Q2 2019. As we noted on our Q1 call and experienced this quarter, NII fell to roughly $11 billion this quarter as variable rate assets repriced lower following a more than 100 basis point decline in average one month LIBOR from Q1. Other notable NII headwinds in the quarter include roughly $300 million of higher premium amortization on our asset backed securities given the lower rate environment and a decline in higher yielding credit card balances. These negative impacts were partially offset by deposit growth coupled with lower deposit pricing. The addition of PPP loans in the quarter was marginally -- it also marginally aided NII as did lower Global Market funding costs. Given the sharp decline in NII coupled with the increase in the balance sheet, driven by deposit growth, net interest yields declined notably quarter-over-quarter by 46 basis points. Looking at the bottom-right chart, the largest driver of that decline was lower interest rates quarter-over-quarter. Another large impact was the increase in deposits, which is modestly helping NII but diluting net interest yield given that most of the excess funding in Q2 was invested in cash or cash equivalents, earning only 10 or 15 basis points. We continue to assess uncertainty with respect to the duration of these deposits. Two other elements diluted net interest yield. They are the higher level of premium amortization; and the lower balances of high-yielding credit cards. In terms of forward NII guidance, we believe the largest impact from the interest rate declines occurred in Q2 as expected. As we enter Q3, we face a headwind from the paydowns of commercial loans, which could reduce NII by a couple of hundred million dollars.  And as a reminder, NII will be impacted by the long end of the curve as our securities portfolio continues to re-price lower. Beyond Q3, NII stability absent material changes from the economic conditions will be dependent on asset growth and/or redeployment of deposits into higher yielding securities rather than cash. Beyond NII as Brian mentioned, the balance and diversity of our revenue streams combined with strong expense management has supported pre-tax pre-provision income despite the unprecedented decline in interest rates. I would also just remind you that short-term rates were near zero in 2014 and 2015 before rates rose. In those years, we produced solid profits. Plus today we have $150 billion in higher loan balances and $500 billion in higher deposit balances with -- which will benefit NII versus those periods. Turning to slide 13 and expenses. At $13.4 billion, this quarter expenses were modestly lower than Q1 2020. For three years now, despite investments in areas such as technology, sales professionals, marketing, philanthropy, new or renovated financial centers, expanded benefits, and increased minimum wage. We have managed expenses well and have operated in a tight range of $13 billion to $13.5 billion in expense each quarter outside of the impairment charge taken in Q3 2019. This quarter was no exception, even with the added costs related to COVID-19. In Q2, we estimate that COVID-related spending versus COVID-related savings netted to an increase in expense, totaling $400 million. We will be working hard to reduce this cost as we move through this crisis, while at the same time ensuring that our customers and employees are safe. The higher cost of COVID was mostly offset by the absence of elevated payroll tax when comparing total noninterest expense to Q1. With respect to expenses beyond Q2, please note that on July 1, we began accounting for merchant services provided directly to our customers versus through a joint venture. Accordingly, again in Q3, we will record revenue and expense for these operations separately as opposed to netting them under the equity method of accounting. As a result, we expect the expense for this business to add roughly $200 million per quarter to our expense run rate. Additional revenue for merchant services in the near term should be roughly $100 million a quarter, improving as the economy recovers and operations become even more fully integrated driving increased value for clients. We are excited to integrate merchant services into our lines of business. Merchant services is an important product for many of our clients, from small businesses to large multinationals who rely on accepting credit and debit cards for significant portions of their revenue. As such, it is core to transactional banking and working capital management. Because our LOBs enjoy leading market share across both consumers and businesses, we can innovate, connect and provide services that add value across the spectrum of payment users, including offering innovations in expedited settlement, enhanced authorization, lease cost routing, liquidity management, credit FX data analytics and many other products. Our new proprietary platform is flexible, resilient and enables us to grow and facilitate the evolution of the payment ecosystem as the marketplace evolves. Turning to asset quality on slide 14. Our underwriting standards have been responsible and strong for many years now, and we expect this fact to benefit us as we advance through this health crisis. One independent indicator of the relative quality of our balance sheet is the Federal Reserve's annual CCAR stress test. Our net charge-off ratio under this year's stress test was once again the lowest of our peers and has been the lowest in seven of the last eight years. Total net charge-offs this quarter were $1.1 billion or 45 basis points of average loans. Net charge-offs rose $24 million from Q1 with an uptick in commercial losses mostly offset by lower consumer losses. Provision expense was $5.1 billion. Our reserve build of $4 billion reflects a weaker economic outlook since the end of Q1, which impacted expected future losses. While we saw increases in commercial reservable criticized exposures, impacted by the virus, overall credit thus far has been better than expected as NPLs only rose modestly versus our expectations. As the economy reopened, we saw lower deferral requests, better payment trends from the stressed borrowers, a slower pace of commercial downgrades towards the end of the quarter and faster payments of line draws than we anticipated. On slide 15, we break out our credit quality metrics for both our consumer and commercial portfolios. On the consumer front, COVID effects on asset quality remained benign. This is driven by deferrals extended to consumer borrowers, coupled with government stimulus for individuals and small businesses. Consumer net charge-offs declined $138 million, which is partially attributable to a deferral which should be -- which should provide a better chance of recovery with stimulus and other assistance. In commercial, we saw $162 million increase in net charge-offs with concentrations in commercial real estate and energy. Our commercial loan book excluding small business ended the quarter at 88% investment-grade or collateralized. One could see COVID impact more clearly and reservable criticized exposures, which increased $9 billion from Q1. This increase was driven not surprisingly by exposures to cruise lines, restaurants, real estate and retailing. Turning to Slide 16. This table provides a full picture of our allowance build since year-end 2019. As you can see our allowance including the reserve for unfunded commitments was $10 billion at year-end and has doubled to more than $21 billion, while our overall loan balances are relatively flat. Note that we ended Q2 with an allowance to loans and leases of 2%. I would also note that coverage ratio for credit card increased to 11%, total commercial loans increased to 1.6% and CRE rose to 11.5% -- excuse me, 3.5%. These ratios reflect our loan mix with consumer concentrated in secured loans with consistent-high underwriting standards which for the past 10 years has focused on high-FICO borrowers with whom we have strong relationships. It also reflects the investment-grade nature of our commercial portfolio with strong payment and debt service characteristics. Our increase in reserves from Q1, reflect an outlook based upon the most recent economic consensus estimates. In addition we continue to include downside scenarios. A weighting of these new scenarios produced a recessionary outlook with a deeper decline and gap to return to positive GDP. It is worth noting that, if one looks at the Fed's stress credit losses in the latest CCAR and just assumes that we have pushed all those losses into reserves today our CET1 ratio would still be above 10.25% versus our minimum of 9.5%. Obviously there remain many unknowns including how government fiscal and monetary actions will impact the outcome and how our own deferral programs will impact losses. But perhaps the biggest uncertainty is how long economic activity and conditions will be significantly impacted by the virus. Okay. Turning to the business segments and starting with Consumer Banking on Slide 17. Despite the enormous financial challenges of various impacts -- impact -- COVID-related impacts including dramatically lower rates, fee reductions, higher provision and increased expense, the business remained profitable in the quarter. And as Brian discussed this health crisis has proven the value of our high-tech and high-touch strategy. The significant investments and innovation in our digital capabilities have been a valuable resource for our customers complementing investments in our financial centers and differentiating us from peers. Provision expense reflected higher expected future losses from the worsened economic conditions. And note that net charge-offs in the period actually declined. So much of the financial burden of expected future losses were incurred in the first half of this year. And because of deferrals significant charge-offs in this segment are not likely until the end of this year or later. Revenue in this business absorbed the brunt of company's NII decline as the segment has the bulk of our deposits. And this segment also bore the brunt of the fee waivers negatively impacting revenue. Card fees were down as a result of lower spending activity, as well as fee waivers. Service charges were down as well due to fee waivers and fewer overdraft and related fees as a result of increased balances in customers' accounts. With respect to expenses as you know banking is considered an essential service. And across the country we have managed to keep 60% of our financial centers open. The team worked through enormous challenges in the first half of the year to assure ongoing service which has been a daily balance between to service our customers' need and the safety of our employees as well as customers. Our costs reflect this balancing act. We've added roles to service calls and managed digital interactions not only for existing products and services, but also for small business applications to the Paycheck Protection Program. Many of these additional personnel work from home. We also continue to invest in the franchise. We added salespeople in addition to the associates to handle customer calls that I have just mentioned. We renovated and added financial centers and we increased minimum wages. The expense from these investments continued to be mitigated at least in part by process improvements, digitalization and technology improvements. Client momentum continued as we saw average deposits rise $104 billion or 15% from Q2 '19. Even more impressive was the fact that 70% of this growth was in checking accounts as clients received stimulus, delayed their tax payments and slowly are ramping up spending. Average loans increased 8% driven by mortgage demand even in this low-rate environment. Mortgage growth was mitigated by a decline in credit card and other consumer balances. We continue to add consumer investment accounts and see strong flows into our Merrill Edge platform. In Q2, we added 9% more customer investment accounts this year than last year with more than 30% of those added digitally. AUM rose 17% driven by flows and market valuation. Let's skip slide 18 and move to Wealth Management as I think we've covered most of the trends already. So referring to Wealth Management and -- to wealth -- to Global Wealth and Investment Management on slide 19 and 20, here again, you saw lower rates as COVID-related credit costs impact an otherwise solid quarter with good AUM flows as well as strong deposit and loan growth. Merrill Lynch and the private bank both continue to grow clients, as we remained a provider of choice for affluent clients. Despite our sales force working from home, in Q2, we added nearly 6,000 net new households at Merrill Lynch and nearly 500 net new relationships in the private bank. Total client balances rose to $2.9 trillion from Q1 driven by the rebound in equity markets. Compared to a year ago, they are up 1% driven by strong growth in deposits, AUM flows and loans. Net income of $624 million was down 42%, driven by a 10% decline in revenue, as well as higher provision expense. The revenue decline was driven equally by the lower NII as well as fees. Non-interest income decreased 7% driven by lower transactional revenues and lower asset management fees driven by market valuations partially offset by the benefit of AUM flows. Expenses were stable year-over-year, as investments made in the past 12 months in sales professionals and technology were offset by lower revenue-related incentives and net savings associated with COVID. Provision expense increased from reserves built for future COVID-related net charge-offs, while current net charge-offs remained low. Moving to Global Banking on slides 21 and 22. As noted earlier, Global Banking saw a strong average loan growth from Q1 line draws, record deposit levels and record investment banking fees. But those benefits were not enough to offset the impact of lower rates and higher provision expense as a result of COVID. The business earned $726 million, falling $1.2 billion from Q2 2019, but this included adding $1.5 billion to the allowance for credit losses this quarter. On a pre-tax pre-provision basis results improved 4% year-over-year driven by record Investment Banking results. In Q2, we were able to improve notably both our Investment Banking revenue and market share for the second straight quarter. Investment Banking fees of 2.2 -- excuse me, $2.2 billion were up 57% year-over-year. This record result included records in both investment-grade as well as equity capital markets. While average loans were up 14% from Q2 2019, I would note that repayment of Q1 draws built significantly as the quarter progressed, which will be an headwind to NII in Q3. I would also note that new loan origination spreads increased quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. At the same time, we continued to see strong growth in deposits, which were up $131 billion or 36% even as the rate paid decline following the decline in LIBOR rates. Rates paid are now back to levels seen at the end of 2015 just before rates began to rise. Growth in Investment Banking fees, loans and deposits reflect not only what we believe to be applied to quality, but also the addition of hundreds of bankers over the past few years increasing and improving our client coverage. Turning to digital on slide 23, as we've already covered most of the important points around loan and deposit activity on 22. As in consumer and GWIM, our digital capabilities are more important and useful than ever in this health crisis, enabling clients to work-from-home and seamlessly manage their treasury needs. And it's no surprise that in this environment we would continue to see increased use of these capabilities. Switching to Global Markets on slide 24. Our teams performed well in an unusual environment producing the best quarter of revenue since the first quarter of 2012. We saw the fixed income market mostly strengthened through the quarter and prices recovered from Q1, with particular strength in credit products. As I usually do, I'll talk about results excluding DVA. This quarter net DVA was a loss of $261 million. Global Markets produced $2.1 billion of earnings in Q2 nearly doubling the prior year's period and increased 42% from solid Q1 results. Year-over-year revenue was up 34% from higher sales and trading results and improved Investment Banking fees, partially offset by the absence of a gain on an equity investment which occurred in Q2 2019. Expenses were well controlled and flat compared to Q2 2019. Within sales and trading -- within revenue, sales and trading improved 35% year-over-year, driven by a 50% improvement in FICC and a 7% improvement in equities. Compared to Q1, sales and trading revenue also improved, as growth in FICC linked quarter overcame a decline in equities from a record in Q1. Trading comparisons to Q2 2019 for FICC reflected better trading performance across all products both macro and credit. FICC results benefited from improved client flows, credit spread tightening, lower funding costs and asset prices which rallied through the quarter. Equity revenue was driven by stronger performance in cash and client financing, partially offset by a weaker performance in derivatives. On Slide 25, note the half year comparisons which shows sales and trading, up 28% year-over-year but otherwise pretty stable over the past several years at around $7 billion. Finally on Slide 26, we show All Other, which reported a profit of $216 million. Revenue benefited from a gain of $704 million from the sale of $9 billion in mortgage loans, which drove the improvement in revenue from Q1. Our effective tax rate this quarter was 7%, reflecting the 11% tax rate expected for the rest of 2020, due to the greater impact of tax credits related to tax-advantaged investments on lower pre-tax income as well as the related adjustment to the year-to-date tax rate. Okay. With that let's open it up for questions. Operator :  We'll go first to Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Glenn Schorr : Hi, thanks very much. Two quick clarifications. On your net interest income comments of down a couple of hundred million, I'm assuming that is off the current base? And then do we stabilize from there? I heard your comments about -- depending on how we assess the duration of and stickiness of the deposits. So maybe you could talk about how do you assess the duration. It sounds good but I don't know how you -- if clients can help you assess that but how you -- how do you assess the duration and stickiness of the deposits? And what would you redeploy into, if you thought that they were somewhat sticky? Paul Donofrio : Yes. So just to be clear, we're talking about a couple of hundred million off of -- from Q2 to Q3. I won't repeat all the kind of drivers of that. Beyond Q3, NII is really kind of -- the growth of NII is going to be dependent upon sort of asset growth and redeployment of deposits into higher-yielding acuities. We've added $284 billion in deposits since year-end. All of that has gone into cash earning 10 basis points. So as we assess the future of this pandemic, as we kind of assess how much of that is going to stick around and we get a little bit more confident on the -- on those two elements that can be deployed into securities or a portion of it, let's say, can be deployed into securities. And that's -- there's a big difference even in these rates between what you can earn on a mortgage-backed security or a treasury bond and 10 basis points. So there's some opportunity there but it has to -- I think we're going to be thoughtful about it and it's one of those things I think you know when you see it. Glenn Schorr : Got it. Maybe a similar question on expenses. The $400 million in COVID-related expense, I'm assuming that's a combination of PPP and work-from-home related things. Do -- does that roll-off starting now that stick around? I want to get to the core number that we're adding the $200 million of merchant servicing expenses on top of. Thanks. Paul Donofrio : Yes, sure. So, as we said, we're sort of estimating that if you take all the increases from COVID-related spending and all the decreases, you had a net $400 million. If you think about all those increases, it's not just PPP. There's supplemental pay. There's child care. There's masks. There's food. There's more financial guards in at our financial centers. You've got all the PPP-related expenses. You've got all the tech expenses moving people -- virtually all our employees move from home -- moving to work-from-home. You got some offsets in sort of some travel and other employee expenses in terms of meetings that all kind of nets down this quarter to $400 million. We're going to work on that. I don't think you can say it's all going to go away in Q3 but we're going to work on those expenses as we move forward. But of course, we're going to make sure anything we do, we're not jeopardizing the safety of our customers and employees. So we think there's some opportunity there. Glenn Schorr : Okay. Last one. The Wealth Management reserve build, I wonder if you could talk about the profile of those loans. How much of that is to things like a building for a wealthy Management would require that build? Paul Donofrio : I think most of it is mortgages. Brian Moynihan : And there's some commercial lending in there, but it's all very high-quality and personal wealthy people's loans and some -- there was 30% of our mortgage originations this quarter aided at 25th. And so it's a significant mortgage book and that picks up some and just the estimates whether it happens or not is a separate question. But we feel good about that portfolio, but it's just the same factors applied to the rest of the portfolios applied in that business. Glenn Schorr : Okay. Appreciate it. Brian Moynihan : We look at things like real estate exposure we consider real estate exposure in that business that people have buildings and things we're talking about. There's -- going back Glenn to the many years, there's no hidden sort of real-estate exposure on our Wealth Management business. It's handled as real estate. Glenn Schorr : Understood. Thanks, Brian. Operator : Next question is from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Mike Mayo : Hey, Brian. Brian Moynihan : Hi, Mike. Mike Mayo : You mentioned July activity is above last year. Is that right? So, just a little bit more color on the green shoots. It seems like the trends are all in your favor. But I'm just wondering, if that's backward looking. In many of your markets like Florida, or Texas, or California I mean, that's where you're big you're seeing an increase in COVID cases. And I guess that leads to death and that leads to shutdown. So from an on-the-ground perspective, do you expect these green shoots to continue? What advice do you give the governors in those states? How does it all shake out? Brian Moynihan : The first advice we give to everybody is try to be safe. The faster you can get the environment to tip over as you've seen in some of the hotspots we talked about last April, you can see the activity pick up. But just to be very precise the data through the 14th of July, so that's about as recent as you might be able to get is up over last year. If you look in the first two weeks of July, it fell a little bit in Texas and places like that, but it's still 25% higher as an aggregate than where they were in the shutdown phase. So it will plateau a little bit Mike I think, and you'll see that ebb and flow. But there are other activities that just overwhelm that what you see in terms of the bars closing stuff, just the general activities the improvement in people's homes spending on their homes. And you saw some of the data today that supports that in the retail sales numbers. So, yes, it's flattened a little bit, because it flattened in credit card. You'll see that more dramatically, because the credit card spending that goes on in restaurants and travel and stuff. But it -- just in the last couple of weeks, it fell mid-single digit percentages, I think in some of those in Texas and Florida, but it's still 25% compared to that week-to-week -- the weeks before the reopening. That's 25% up. So, we'll see it play out. It's hard to be any more down to date than July 14. Mike Mayo : And then a separate question. I guess, you've added more to your reserve what $8 billion added to your reserves the last two quarters another $4 billion this quarter pretty remarkable. And your net charge-off ratio was flat quarter-to-quarter. Talk about a disconnect, however, maybe it's not a disconnect. So I guess, it's a tough question. But what would your charge-offs fee? What would your NPAs be if you didn't have the forbearance in place? Like, if it ended tomorrow and you had to recognize the full extent of the problems just in a sense of order of magnitude would it be 5% higher? Or 10% higher? 50% higher? What? Brian Moynihan : Just to give you a simple answer. If you -- and a little bit of this Mike will always depend on timing, because if you think about credit cards then there's a roll rate to them as you well know. But just for the second quarter, I think the number would have been another $40 million higher, if you took all the stuff and assume the payment behavior took place but there was no deferral. And so that's $40 million on what? $600 million to $700 million, so it's something small. Interesting enough for the non-deferred customers, the delinquency quarter-to-quarter actually went down 15 or 20 basis points. For the non-deferred customer, excuse me, the non-deferred customers. So 90% of people in cards that didn't defer their delinquency went down quarter-to-quarter. And so, as you think about that, it's a mixed bag. The other thing that's inherent in your question is, all of us getting used to CECL versus the old methods of providing which is, you provide for a lifetime and then the losses are going to come that later down the road by definition, or else you have it as CECL provision. So, you'll see the actual losses that's come in later than later quarters. But you're right. Right now, we are seeing nothing that is consistent with an 11% employment rate in the actual consumer payment behavior. And that has to do with the stimulus and things that's helping the margins quite substantially. So it's hard to predict, because there's a lot of factors in it, but that's kind of the data points I'd give you to give you a sense of it. Mike Mayo : And just last follow-up. I mean, clearly, the stock market based on your stock price doesn't believe you. They think your customers are a lot weaker. So are we just not seeing it yet? I mean two or three quarters now where you say, oh, it was a lot worse than we expected. Or do you think this is going to play out in that, like actually the borrowers are in better shape than people realize? Brian Moynihan : I think, part of this will play out in terms of how the path forward on Phase 4 Stimulus and everything occurs. But even on the commercial side, if you look our -- the NPLs went up $350 million or something on the commercial NPLs for the quarter and 40 basis points. So even on the commercial side and we went through -- we asked our team to go through every commercial borrower in our business banking and our middle market segment, which is tens of thousands of borrowers, and assess everyone and rerate to make sure they're all up to date. Make sure, yes, just really go work on it, when they were at home and not able to do as much. And they've gone through that book. And what you see criticized moved up and that's expected. The actual non-performers aren't. And so, those commercial customers are adapting and you're seeing it. So I think the -- we basically have looked at the assessment, the provision setting methodology is, as we said, 10% unemployment year-end, 9% first half of next year, it gets down to 7.5%. So it's not a rosy picture in a lot of ways. And the proof is we give all those data to the Fed, as Paul said, and they do a stress test. And under those scenarios, our losses run, I don't know, 4%, 4.7%. And we're sitting with 2% reserves today and we're not in that scenario in terms of actual payment behavior by customers or delinquencies and cash, and that has to do with the stimulus is different in this crisis than it's ever been. It was given directly to consumers to sustain their ability to carry their day-to-day expenses. Mike Mayo : All right. Thank you. Paul Donofrio : Hey, Mike. It's obviously -- Mike Mayo : Yes. Paul Donofrio : Hey, Mike. It's obviously hard to see data yet, right? But there are some clues out there and you can start looking at those clues across the industry. And I would -- you mentioned one of them, let's just look at losses. You can look at NPL growth. You can look at reserve quick growth. And then as Brian just said, I mean, it's not like this is one-time where our loss ratios in the Fed stress tests have been the lowest among peers. They've done eight exams. Every one of those exams is kind of different. They did this thing and that one, stress this thing more on that other one and change something else on the next one. Seven out of eight of them, no matter what they changed, no matter what they did, we had the lowest loss rate. So there is some evidence out there if you look carefully at it. Mike Mayo : All right. Thanks again. Operator : Next question is from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global. Jim Mitchell : Hey. Good morning. Hey, Brian, just a follow-up on your corporate credit comment. If you look at your NPLs, you absolutely had the least amount of increase quarter-over-quarter versus your peers. And I appreciate your comments that you did really a real micro as opposed to macro look at every individual loan. So when we think about that, do you think it's -- your performance is more to do with the fact that you took a micro look rather than some peers maybe doing a macro look? Or is it really just your higher exposure to investment grade, your industry mix? And how do you think about the massive amount of capital raising in the second quarter and the liquidity that provides to corporate borrowers and how you factor that in? Just -- that's it. Thanks. Brian Moynihan : I'm not sure where it is in that sequence, but it's the latter part of it, which is that, basically it's the quality of the portfolio. So our commercial real estate exposure, as Paul said earlier, is much -- it's not going into last crisis we had $14 billion or something of construction-related for housing. We have like $400 million or something like that. It's very little. So the kinds of exposure to get pulled on pretty quickly. And remember, we took a lot of charge-offs in the first quarter for what? For gas company exposure I think a couple of hundred million Paul. And those -- yes so, we've been taking care of the portfolio. So, it's not macro-micro. It's actually just the quality of what we have done in client selection across the last decade gets us there. And so -- and that's why you see differences in the rates in the stress tests and other things. But that's responsible growth and we built this company so that'd be adamantine in all times and fortress and that's how we build it. And we'll see where this all goes. But remember that our SCB is under the floor yet the losses -- and there's a lot of objective third-party evidence that shows and that has a lot to do with our mix of businesses and how we build them. Jim Mitchell : Yes. Absolutely. And then maybe on deposit growth, it continues to be I think surprisingly strong. Appreciate the comment of not sure how it holds up and you're holding it in cash for now. But when you think about -- is there any kind of trends throughout the quarter as the stimulus money got paid? Do you see deposit growth slowing? Or are you seeing it turn negative lately? How do we think about the ability for those at least near term what are you seeing in terms of deposits over the last month? Brian Moynihan : Well and I'll let Paul talk about this on the commercial side especially because he used to run that business for us a long time ago before we got him to be a CFO. But the reality is this the place we're uncertain is in the large cash inflows from corporate customers that you're not sure when they're going to start using the money and redeploy the money and want them to frankly. We should want them to redeploy that money into the economy as opposed to having drawn or raise money in the markets and have it sitting on the balance sheet. So that's the real volatility question is when do they -- when do those companies move some money out for higher yield because some of the money marketing prints are settling in with a little more yield to them and things like that and the stability allows them to take -- think about putting it off a bank's balance sheet. So that's the volatility question in terms of deposits. It's around that. But when you look at consumer just to give you a sense, the linked-quarter growth in consumer checking was $50 billion. We had 180,000 net new checking accounts, year-over-year up almost 900,000. Those are numbers that are normal quarters' sort of net production. I think we might have been 250,000 or something like that in a quarter like this. And so what's happened is we still are building up that core consumer base and the average amount in accounts are up 12%, 20%. Some of that's been spent down. We think all the EIP-type stimulus as well is largely out of people's accounts. It's been gone through the system. Obviously the unemployment supplements for the limited number of customers we have. That's a small -- in any group that's 10% of the population, so it's smaller than the whole. But you're seeing that stimulus was that $1,200-type stimulus went -- came and went out of people's accounts pretty much. On a small business you're seeing the PPP, the 65% to be spent which is also good because that's future stimulus to be deployed. And so, if you think about all those pieces, I would focus more on this. Paul's comments about understanding whether this deposit are going to stick is more of a commercial question. And a large corporate question than it is a wealth management consumer question because what's going on behind this is we've ground out another even with half -- yes 40% of our branches shut down due to the environment we have ground out, digital sales and digital growth and even non-digital growth to the tune of 180,000 new core checking accounts with average balance moving up at 92% core and that sticks your ribs money and we will deploy that over time. But you had to make sure that like all of you are worried about where we go next and that's why we're trying to keep the liquidity position that might run out of here for the clients' purposes or whatever. So Paul, I think all the volatility comments are really on the institutional side. Paul Donofrio : Yes. I'm not sure to add anything Brian. Maybe just a macro point of obviously if the money supply grows, more our deposit balances are going to go up. And you -- when you look at -- in addition when you look at the treasuries bank account at the Fed it's got an enormous balance way higher than usual. And my guess is some of that's going to end up in the private sector as well. So there were some -- perhaps some macro forces that would suggest that deposit balances are going to grow at banks and we're going to get our fair share. There are a couple of little just tiny things about the third quarter that's worth reminding people. Tax payments were delayed and they're going to get paid in the third quarter. Plus we're all hoping as Brian says that spending continues to increase and so some of that excess money that's sitting on people's accounts may get spent both in the corporate and consumer side. And then in GWIM, you've just got a lot of deposits came out of the market and went into deposit accounts and if markets continue to feel good to people, you expect to see some of that come out of deposits and go back into the market. Jim Mitchell : That's all really helpful. Thanks. Operator : Our next question is from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good morning. A couple of follow-ups there. One on the points that you were making about the deposits. It's interesting that you had all those drawdowns and paybacks, but the deposits didn't leave yet. That's basically what you're referring to, right? Brian Moynihan : Yes, Betsy, that's the interesting point. You'd expect if they pay them back you just seen it, but other cash came into those companies and it came on the books and I think we grabbed more than our fair share. Nothing to do with the consumer side, but on the institutional side. It's been interesting because our predictions would have been that we'd have seen the deposits decline already and they haven't. Betsy Graseck : So, my two questions. One is on just the forbearance and the waivers. Can you give us an update as to how you're dealing with those? Do they roll off automatically? Are you going person-by-person? How should I be modeling this fee waiver fading? Is it going to come back? Do you kick it back in? And I mean do you stop the fee waivers in 3Q or is it going to be more of a phase-in through 2021? Just help us understand how you're dealing with that. Brian Moynihan : I think maybe the size of the mortgage has different aspects because of statutes and stuff. The rest of the lending side stuff begins especially like the small business as I said earlier it really runs off as we speak. And then some of the other products run through. We're always going to help consumers in distress. So, if somebody calls up and says I'm unemployed and I can't work and stuff we're going to work with them and we're going to work on both on the fee side and on the collection side for the lack of a better term. But our view from the start was we want to have that dialogue with the consumer to help figure out where they stand and so that activity starts to pick up. The waivers by definition were 90 days and things they roll off. But in -- what you'll get away from is people who did it out of panic which when you see somebody's paid every month, obviously, they didn't need the waiver. Those people roll off and disappear and you'll get down to the people that you need to actually help. They're unemployed and struggling and we'll help them. We'll work with them like we always do in our collection efforts. So, that's the sort of credit side of the thing. And the big numbers will move. The numbers of requests I said have dropped 98%, so it's really nothing if you look at our percentages relative to industry and mortgage were lower across the board 200 basis point, 150 basis points in terms of requests and stuff. So, we feel good about that. When you get to the fees, this is really going to come down to this. We all -- we went into this thinking about it as a bit of a natural-disaster type approach process. So, that's going to come down to where the consumer lives the market the condition what's going on in that market and whether they're able to work and things like that. So, we'll see that play out. If there's another round of stimulus payments, we waive the fees so people wouldn't have the fees. We've held off on the fees that they had that could have been negative in their account to make sure they got the whole $1200 in the case of last payment. We will do that again because that's the right thing to do to make sure they get the benefits of that -- those payments. But those things will sort of ease through the third quarter depending on really a specific question and then as you get towards next year, they'll normalize. Betsy Graseck : And then as we go through this pandemic, obviously, we've got flash points building again in certain locations like you were asked earlier on the call, you've got a big footprint of branches in these locations. So, I would think that your programs are open obviously for folks who are coming back into that second wave. Just want to confirm that. And then how are you thinking about the branch footprint just generally? I mean you mentioned earlier about opportunities to improve efficiencies to call back the $400 million net COVID cost increase that you experienced this quarter. But a little bit longer term given the increase in digital the fast ramp that we've seen in the most recent couple of months does that make you think, hey, we can pull back on our branches even more than we had been thinking before? Give us an update there. Thanks. Brian Moynihan : Yes, I think the time to figure that out will be a little bit later Betsy not because we don't work it all the time. So, even year-over-year I think we're down 30 or 40 branches or something like that in terms of branch count. This -- last year's second quarter -- or this year's second quarter we're always working as dynamic. They might be bigger and replace two or three small ones. They might be places that we just had too many whatever but we'll always be working that. So, 6,100 to 4,300 branches continue to work and we're doing that by following customer behavior. So if this -- some of this behavior changes stick to the ribs, you'll see us keep fine tuning our system. By the way the cost of deposits, now with all the operating costs in consumer over deposits actually went down year-over-year again to -- by about 7 basis points or something like that. So we continue to manage that overall operating cost down, and it's not just the branches it's all of the call centers and all the things around it. So let us play that out. I don't think -- and then by the way remember, we're deploying and we opened branches in the middle of this thing in places in Ohio and stuff we didn't have. And so that replaces on the account at a much different execution than something that may have been left over from years ago. So it will play out. I don't think they'll get -- they'll go one way or the other way dramatically, but what will happen is some of the count we believe will be consolidated markets as we've always been doing and deploy to markets where we don't have reach. I think on a given day, we're still getting 0.5 million business to the branches. So it is an important part of what we do and the teammates in those branches have done incredible work being open every day during this crisis despite what was going on in the environment around them. So I -- it will always be an important -- an incredibly important part, which makes us different. We are a big digital company and we're a big physical company and that combination proves superior customer reach and results. Betsy Graseck : Thanks. Operator : We'll go next to Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Matt O\u2019Connor: Good morning. Can you just talk about the small business PPP in terms of the timing of when you think it will be repaid or forgiven and remind us of the accounting there? And is that included in your net interest income outlook? Thanks. Paul Donofrio : Why don't I start with the accounting? So the -- if you look at this quarter, there's about a little under $100 million. It will be a little more than that next quarter in NII for PPP. That's a function of 1% interest rate plus under FAS 91, you're going to amortize the fees into NII over the life of the loans. In terms of the overall program, we're -- we did about 335,000 loans in a few weeks. That was quite expensive in terms of all that we had to do to do that well, and so I would not expect much if any profitability out of PPP. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay. And does that include the fees that you get if it's accelerated from a forbearance? I think there were some articles out there that you're going to donate any profit. But obviously, there's just the focus on the revenue, and to your point, there is the cost as well so. Paul Donofrio : Yes. If -- once there's forbearance to the extent that we were amortizing those fees into NII, once a loan is forgiven then you have to accelerate the remaining fees that haven't been amortized. So it could be a spike in a quarter or two if we start seeing a lot of forbearance. But again, as you know, we've -- we said, we're going to donate profits, but I wouldn't expect a lot of profits out of this program. 335,000 loans in a quarter is probably I don't know I think somebody in consumer told me was like 10 years of loans in small business. This was a massive effort that involved people outside the company, in the company to get -- to do it well. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay. And then just separately on the criticized commercial loans, it's helpful that you do disclose this. I'm not sure everybody does. So I appreciate that. But how would you think about the loss content on that? Obviously, it's a much bigger bucket than say non-performers and -- are loans that you're watching. But how should we kind of think about the risk of loans that are kind of criticized versus say non-performing? Or how much might flow into non-performing? Brian Moynihan : Yes. Well, I'd say that that's -- that depends on the loan. They're largely secured. They're collateralized what sort of recovery, but remember the criticized is -- the ratings driven is a loss -- a probability to follow the loss given default and then the collateral structure. So that's all built into the reserving methodology that results in the reserve build. So, it's not something that you have to think of separately than NPLs. It's just -- there are different stages in the process of getting through the system, but so it's really -- you have to say if it's -- we -- for example, we have a lot of retailers who have gone through bankruptcy over the last several years. We haven't lost anything because of the method of securing yourself and things like that. And that's -- but that's a business we've had for decades that has done a great job there. Whereas if it's an unsecured line and somebody you have a follow-on -- somebody follows quickly that can be more problematic. But it's -- just rest assured it's all built into the methodology which produces the loss content which produces the reserves which -- in the scenarios we use. Matt O'Connor: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Next question is from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Ken Usdin : Thanks. Good morning. I had a couple of questions on the JV dissolution. So just wondering, Paul relative to your $100 million fees; first of all, where is it located kind of where are we going to see it? And second of all can you help us give perspective of what it was maybe at its peak? And you've mentioned it could get better as the economy improves. What's the best metric we can watch of your disclosures to track that progress? Paul Donofrio : A portion of that revenue is going to be in consumer. A portion of it is going to be in Global Banking. I -- we'd have to think about how to help you see it because it's -- it never -- certainly on a net basis it never was a big number in terms of net profits coming out of that JV. We expect it now that we can integrate it, do it our way, really leverage our customer relationships, put our full sales force more directly behind it and innovate. We think this is incredibly important to our customers and we can grow it. But right now it's -- we gave you I think we gave you some perspective. It's about -- I would expect the revenues there to be about $100 million in the near term. But we would expect them to grow as we ramp up and some of our investments start to bear fruit. And again, I don't know how to answer your question on how you can see it. I have to think about that, whether it's something appropriate for the supplement or not. Ken Usdin : Okay. And just in terms of fees, other categories, wealth management, the asset management part was down. Was that because of the averaging effect? And should that improve given the period-end market levels that we saw? Paul Donofrio : Yes. You have to remember that AUM fees are on a one-month lag, so you're picking up there what happened at the end of the first quarter. Ken Usdin : Yes. And lastly, just any comments about the Investment Banking pipeline given the relative strength that we saw in the second quarter? Thanks, Paul. Paul Donofrio : Yes sure. The Investment Banking had a great, great quarter. And we know we picked up significant market share. We've been picking up significant market share for many quarters now. I think all of you have sort of recognized that. It was a record. I think our market share is above 8% at this point. And our market share in middle market investment banking is also rising given our emphasis there on the bankers we add. I think we're up to -- we're over 9% there. A lot of activity as we help clients raise capital to address their needs, you can't really expect -- I don't -- we don't know the answer, but we're already sort of seeing a little bit of a slowdown in activity in the first couple of weeks of this quarter. So I don't think you can expect that the third quarter is going to be as robust as the second quarter has been. But what I will want to emphasize we feel really good about the progress we have made with our clients in terms of market share both for large companies around the world and the middle market companies. Operator : We'll go next to Saul Martinez. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Saul Martinez : Hi. Good morning guys. I wanted to start off on NII, what's just a bit of a clarification. You said NII would be down a couple of hundred million quarter-on-quarter on commercial paydowns. You also said that long-end rates would also weigh on NII. Just give me -- give us a sense of what the order of magnitude could be in terms of additional NII pressure to the third quarter from long-end rates? Now I would assume that the redeployment of cash into securities is something that helped, but only over a longer period of time. And I know Paul in the past we've talked about reinvestment risk and kind of sized up the impact of long-end rates on securities cash flow. So if you can help us understand the potential impacts on third quarter and how to think about it beyond that? Paul Donofrio : Yes, look I will say in terms of our $200 million of current perspective being down quarter-over-quarter 2Q to 3Q, we're kind of putting all that stuff in there, right? Saul Martinez : Yeah. Paul Donofrio : You've got loans being potentially down. You've got average LIBOR coming down. You've got the securities portfolio. It's kind of all in there. Securities portfolio about $20 billion, $25 billion matures every quarter. And reinvestment yields right now are significantly below where that -- where the portfolio is. So that's just going to slowly dilute over time. We can offset some of that, if we decide to take some of these deposits that are now sitting in cash and put them into securities we can get a sort of a natural offset. But we have to sort of just see how that all plays out. Saul Martinez : Okay. I don't think -- I may have misunderstood. I thought that you met. So the $200 million a couple of hundred million is all in not simply from the impact of commercial paydowns, but from a number of things I guess. The -- I guess I wanted to go back and follow-up on Matt's question on PPP and get a little bit better sense for what the order of magnitude of the impact could be, because I mean you have $25 billion of PPP loans and I think it's fair to assume that a pretty sizable proportion of those will be forgiven. And given the fee rates on those, I mean we're not talking about small numbers even relative to your -- the size of your NII, I mean you get to easily over $1 billion. So I guess my first question is, why should we see a pretty significant spike in NII in 4Q and 1Q as those loans start to get forgiven and the income is recognized? And I guess relatedly on the expenses, I guess I'm trying to understand what you mean by you're not going to make a lot of money on that. Is it just that it's sort of in the expense base already and you've had to ratchet up expenses? Or is it that as revenues are recognized from an accounting standpoint you'll donate those accounting -- that accounting revenue away as one of your competitors is doing. I guess I'm trying to understand the order of magnitude timing and geography of the impact. So they don't seem to be small to me. Brian Moynihan : We announced in April I think it was that we'd go away the net profits from this activity. There's a lot of costs -- internal costs obviously allocation of 10,000 people we had working on the origination platform of this to the high point. The forgiveness what we've got 3,000 people lined up to work on forgiveness that are already working on it and we open for business in a couple of weeks. And then we had -- in part we also had to hire third parties coming to do some work and supplement us then -- and so there's a lot of elements. So where it shows up in revenue and -- we'll deal with it. But just I -- well the revenue you're saying is not insignificant. The issue is there's a lot of cost against it. Saul Martinez : Yeah. Brian Moynihan : Some are in the P&L and some are going to be next quarter's P&L, because on the forgiveness side, we have these teammates working on it. So we'll reconcile it all for you, but this space to commitment was to give away to net profits. That was something we committed in April. This is not new news. Saul Martinez : Okay. But am I thinking about it right in terms of-- Paul Donofrio : You're not going to see-- Saul Martinez : Yes. Go ahead. Paul Donofrio : To your point on the revenue, you're not going to see it in the revenue until the loans start to get forgiven. Saul Martinez : Yes, which we would assume is what fourth quarter? First quarter? Or? Paul Donofrio : We do see -- we see -- yes. We don't know when it's going to be. Brian Moynihan : Yes. And by the way in phase 4 they're talking about extending and doing more loans and there's a bunch of proposals. So a little bit of this was hard to predict, because if they say you can do loan A and then do another loan or extend it that's -- even in the last quarter we're going from eight weeks to -- or 12 weeks to 24 weeks and things like that. So it's -- just look there's no mystery here. We'll just -- we just don't know until we get through it what exactly is going to happen because the rules changed so much. Saul Martinez : Yeah. Okay. All right. Thanks guys. I appreciate it. Operator : The next question is from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Vivek Juneja : Hey, Brian, hey, Paul a question that I wanted to just clarify. The consumer loans that been -- that had been deferred, I'm presuming in sort of late June or early July you started to see some of those stock to get through the deferral period, just deferrals or 90 days. And so what are you seeing in the ones where deferrals are done? What percentage are re-upping and asking for a deferral to cut anew versus how many are going off? And of those going off what are you seeing? Brian Moynihan : We're not -- the -- your point Vivek is that we're sort of -- it's now the time for that. It all kind of -- the time period that most of it occurred is now in a time period where it rolls off. And so we'll know better. But you separate the card, we've already seen a couple of hundred thousand roll off and a bunch of them are rolling off as we speak. So that is 85% of our card and so separate that. From the standpoint of all the other aspects what I said earlier about small business, which is the next biggest -- which is the biggest percentage category, yeah, those are docs and dentists in there. They've all told us they're paying us and their payments are now coming up in July and early August. In terms of home loans, we're seeing the numbers on deferral drop every week because there the new requests are less than people who have continued to pay. And so it's going to come down to cards and we're in that period of time. But there are substantial reserves set-up based on the credit characteristics of those individual card holders and what our expected outcome for them are. And as we said earlier, a lot of them -- a substantial number of them paying us every month, some haven't been paying us at all, some have been paying us partly and that will all play out this quarter. When they charge-off with them we'll be down -- as that plays out over the roll-rate type of thing. But it's all in the reserves today. And while we say that there's -- yeah there's a decent chunk of reserves in the card business that is specifically built by these deferred loans. What I said earlier, if you didn't hear it was that for the second quarter for the people who had deferred, the actual increase in charge-offs would have been about, I don't know $30 million, $40 million on a basis $600 and some million whatever it is. So it wasn't a substantial difference yet. And so those are the people that only got enough that they were rolled and charged off during the quarter. So let us see it play out. It's in the reserves. It will be covered by the reserves. Vivek Juneja : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Our next question is from Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead. Brian Kleinhanzl : Yeah. Thanks. Just two quick questions. I mean, first on the expenses. Just how are we should be thinking about the expense trajectory as we look out to the third quarter, fourth quarter? I get the extra $200 million from merchant services, but then how much of these COVID-type expenses are expected to roll off into the third quarter, and then that still if we get the typical seasonality as well in the back half of the year? Brian Moynihan : Yes. So all of those factors, I think Paul laid out earlier, but what we were reminding people is last year when we unwound the joint venture and told you about it this time last year, we said when we took it from a joint venture interest through the P&L on the balance sheet interest, it was going to increase our expenses. That $200 million it -- this is the quarter where it happens. And so we just want to make sure people are factoring that in. Absent that, you know, that we manage expenses tightly in this company and we'll manage them down. And we'll have some pluses and minuses and we'll work it down, but we didn't want people to forget that we told you that last year. All the rest of it will be the same, sort of, management practice we had. You have some PPP expenses come down a little bit. You have -- as we've -- people have moved around opened up a little bit, you have a little more business activity expenses. We'll see it play out. But then and you have the seasonality as you mentioned. And that will all be standard fare, but the key difference is we want to make sure people didn't forget what we told you last year. Brian Kleinhanzl : Okay. And then a separate one just simple is the tax rate guide that you gave in the second half, does that roll forward into 2021? Thanks. Paul Donofrio : I don't think we have a good answer for year 2021 yet. At least I don't have an answer, but we can get back to you on that if you need it. But for the rest of the year, it will be around 11%. Brian Kleinhanzl : Yeah. Okay. Operator : And we'll take our final question today from Charles Peabody with Portales. Please go ahead. Charles Peabody : Yeah. I wanted to get some more color on your consumer and community bank and particularly the profitability of the various product lines like cards, mortgages, autos, branching. And I ask that because on a relative basis your consumer and community bank has done much better than the other big three Wells, JPMorgan, and Citi. And I know a big part of it is probably cards where the other businesses are losing money. The other companies are losing money in cards. So, can you talk a little bit about the profitability of your different product lines and the relative value that they produced for you guys versus other major banks? Brian Moynihan : I'm not sure I frankly agree with your premise that the profitability of our consumer bank is driven by the deposit business. And so given that you're in the middle of a twist right now with rates falling and the floors of zero rates in the consumer business that part it fell this quarter, but that'd be expected as you go through this twist. So it's been running -- the deposit segments have been running $2 billion a quarter type of numbers. And if that's in the consumer lending segment, would have been running even back in 2019 about $1 billion a quarter. So it's a business which is -- and that's all lending not just the card lending. So it's a business which is driven by the deposit business when the rates fell as quickly and we moved rates down in the quarter it's going to take a little while to catch back up. And -- but that's -- but I'm not sure, I agree with the premise and that is driven by the card business. The card business is a portion of that a-third of the general operating profit. Paul Donofrio : I think you're right, Brian. I think it -- the way to think about it is we started at a position of profitability before rates came down. That was stronger than many of our competitors given the strength of our deposit franchise and given how careful we have been with respect to credit unsecured consumer credit. You're now seeing us getting hurt on the -- because that deposit franchises and those deposits aren't as valuable in a lower-rate environment, but you're not seeing us have the same sort of potential losses in unsecured consumer, because we just don't have as much as others. Brian Moynihan : Yeah. Be that as it may because that lending portion lost money this quarter. And the deposit business continue to make money this quarter. So I'm not sure, I get that the starting point, but just to give you a sense. And so there wasn't a lot of money overall, but it was made by the deposit business. Charles Peabody : I guess, the starting point was that the card businesses tend to be an outsized product for the other big banks and they're -- they clearly are losing money. And so is that the big differentiation? Is your card business losing money this quarter as well and -- but less so than the other big businesses other big companies? Brian Moynihan : Yes. The lending business lost money. We don't -- I don't have a separate card P&L. But the lending business and consumer lost money. The deposit business made money and brought it to profit and offset $0.75 billion of losses on the lending side, because of the provisions versus $0.75 billion of profit after tax. So -- but remember, what drives the profitability consumer business is the position we have across all of the products. We don't think of a lending business. And as we think of a customer business that is number one position in deposits, 92% core checking account, checking account growth of a million accounts year-over-year. The average balances of accounts growing year-over-year or even taking out the COVID impact, they're still growing at double-digits typically in a year. That -- the operating cost coming down year-over-year in terms of as a percentage of deposits. These are all good measures that give you a great anchor, but when -- it gets tougher when rates are very low. That's -- we played that. I've been CEO for just my 11th year and has been through 9/11. I think the Fed fund rate has basically been zero a quarter and so that that's what we're doing. The card business is a nice business. We keep it to a size that we think is consistent with our adamantine commitment to responsible growth and now therefore that, it's never going to drive the P&L one way or the other way. Then the risk-adjusted margin is 8% in that business today they're in actual charge-offs. Remember what we've -- what's causing the losses is you're putting up reserves for the rest of the life of the portfolio in one quarter given an economic scenario that's deteriorated. So it's a good -- it's a wonderful business for us. It's our biggest business in terms of profit. And it -- but we don't run it as a card business, or as a home loan business. We got out of that many -- a decade ago saying, it is the consumer business and we drive it on a unified basis. Charles Peabody : All right. Thank you. Operator : It appears we have no further questions. I'll return the floor to Brian for closing remarks. Brian Moynihan : Well, thank you, and thank you for spending time with us this morning. It's another quarter where we've driven responsible growth. We continue to manage this company tightly given the environment we're in, and we continue to drive the core activities forward. And this quarter, we're especially pleased with the work our team did in Global Markets and Investment Banking area gaining share and providing the earnings power to have us earn twice our dividend build our capital, build our liquidity, and have a -- in the worst economic quarter since the Great Depression. So thank you. We'll talk to you next time. Operator : This will conclude today's program. Thanks for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

It is now my pleasure to turn the program over to your host, Lee McEntire. Lee McEntire : Good morning. Welcome and thank you for joining the call to review the third quarter results. I trust everybody has had a chance to review our earnings release documents, as usual they're available including earnings presentation that we will be referring to during the call on the Investor Relations section of the bankofamerica.com website. Brian Moynihan : Thank you, Lee, and thank all of you for joining and I hope all of you are staying safe. We are going to begin on slide 2. And today, before Paul takes you through the detail on the financials, I thought I'd give you some thoughts on the first three quarters of 2020 and how we're driving for you here at Bank of America. As an opening comment, the economy and markets this year have been defined more by than anything else by the impact of the global health care crisis. This has created a sinuous path for the recovery. As we have said early on here at Bank of America and what our data continues to suggest is that we are seeing a return to the fundamentals of a generally sound underlying economy, but we won't get there until we fully address the healthcare crisis and its associated effects. These effects have been lessened by the monetary and fiscal policies, and by the core health of the US consumer given those policies. There are three key themes that I'd like to comment on. One is the economy generally, what we see in our data and the impact of the projected path on the company's earnings and prospects going forward. The second is how do we continue to think about and manage the risk resulting from the economic downturn and the subsequent beginnings of the recovery, and the third is how we're making progress given all that backdrop on our corporate strategies.  Before I touch on these items, just a brief summary of the quarter. Overall, a solid performance given the operating backdrop we face we. We earned around $5 billion after tax or $0.51 per share. We ended the quarter with a capital ratio of 11.9% versus 9.5% minimum. For the third period of this pandemic, we've earned more than twice our dividends, attesting to the strong balance sheet security of this company. The operating environment continues to require more operational excellence than ever before. It requires delivery of immediate technology capabilities across our franchise from our group of talented teammates. It also has to deliver a customer experience that can be redefined on a daily basis. Paul Donofrio : Thanks, Brian. I'm starting on slide 5 and 6 together. And most periods my earnings remarks are focused on year-over-year comparisons but this quarter, many of my comments will be directed towards comparisons against Q2, 2020, as most investors we speak with are more interested in our progress quarter-over-quarter as we work sequentially through this health crisis and given COVID has made year-over-year comparisons less relevant. Q3 net income of $4.9 billion or $0.51 per share compares to $3.5 billion or $0.37 in Q2. The earnings improvement was driven by lower provision expense, as we modestly added to the reserves for credit losses in Q3 compared to the more significant increase in reserves in Q2 versus Q2, the lower provision expense was mostly offset by lower NII and higher cost of litigation and costs of the covered environment. Lower rates and loan balances caused NII compression, which I will discuss in a moment. The linked quarter decline in noninterest income was driven by the more robust trading and IB environment in Q2, as well as a $700 million gain on the sale of mortgages recorded in Q2. While down linked-quarter, fees from capital markets in both market making and investment banking were solidly up year-over-year. At $1.8 billion, investment banking fees was a second best quarter in the company's history. Brian noted progress in activity levels across many of our businesses. And that showed up in increased levels of fees, which helped to mitigate the linked quarter decline in capital markets revenue. Operator :  Our first question is from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. GlennSchorr: Hi, thanks very much. So you've historically been incredibly stable in trading. And again, you are this quarter, but I guess I have a question to rehash on during times like this, you have some peers that will have bigger spikes, and then they'll come back down to earth at other times. And I'm just curious if you could talk about \u2013 you are steady but you're not seeing the same spikes? Is that your risk tolerance? Is it a CCAR stress testing thing? Is it a mix of business and is it conscious, meaning are you investing to close some gaps? Just curious if you could tell us about that from the markets perspective? Thanks. PaulDonofrio: Sure. Well, look, again, our sales and trading results were solid with the total revenue up 4% year-over-year, equities is up 6, FICC is up 2. We had no days with trading losses again this quarter. If you kind of look at, I don't really like talking about competitors, but every competitor is going to have a different business mix. And many of our competitors, I will say, take more risk in one quarter or another, clearly that can create some differences in relative performance. We don't really focus that much on individual quarters, but instead we look at results over longer time periods. And, as noted, sales and trading is up 22% year-to-date. I would also note that we're gaining share we think in equities and other parts of our markets business, and we've gained, we certainly have gained share in investment banking. And there have been quarters where we've done better, I mean, than some of our peers go back to Q1, wherein you'll see in equities where we basically did better than all our peers. So, we're staying focused on the medium to long term, we're investing in the business, and we were taking share . GlennSchorr: Fair enough. Maybe just one follow up on. You noted, obviously, loan demand stabilized, trough quarter for NII, don't expect to add to reserves, deferrals mostly over, and you have a $35 billion capital cushion. I'm curious what you feel is a more natural number. And at some point, we'll get off buyback suspension. So, what's a more natural number for your capital cushion? And what might be your intentions on what to do with that excess because it feels like organic growth; you're going to make more money than you can pile into organic growth for a while. Brian Moynihan : And that's a good list to work with in terms of citing things, and yes we are generating twice our dividend or more, have been for every quarter even when you put up the reserves, even while the rate structure hits. So, trough quarter for NII last quarter, expenses coming down, built the reserves, we'd expect that we'll get through the stress test, and then we'll start to go into capital redeployment as we did before. And our general goal is to run about 100 basis points over the minimum. So for us, that's 10.5, which is another reason why the mix of business is so important to us that you referenced earlier. Remember, we had a stress capital buffer that was 2.5, and we didn't use all of it. But so, we got plenty of cushions here from an operational basis in terms of the ability to use capital management once we're free and clear. Operator : And we can move next to Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global. JimMitchell: Hey, good morning. Maybe one for Brian, given the pressure in the industry and your scale advantages, do you see -- is there an opportunity here to kind of pressure advantage a little bit and try to accelerate market share and sort of what that might mean for expenses if you did? Brian Moynihan : Yes, well, I think we've been able to push market share. So, if you look at the FDIC data, I think we were up 60 or 70 basis points in aggregate deposit market share June 30 to June 30, and everybody had the benefits from the monetary policy, but what we watch is where the market share is going to stick to the breadth. So think about in terms of adding commercial bankers, which we've added. Think about it in terms of entering new markets and branches. This year, we've entered several new markets, if you look at the deposits, in these markets, that we've been open a while, they're $50 million per branch moving to $100 million per branch. And think about the wealth management business, adding financial advisors, so we just keep driving that total. And if you think about -- we have $1.7 trillion in deposits, $800 billion plus in consumer, but a lot of other people forget that we also have a personal business in GWIM with $200 billion, $250 billion plus in deposits. So we have pressed our advantage in consumer, those who've been around the company, we\u2019ve repositioned the consumer business from 60%, primary checking to 90% plus, and that's a million new checking accounts year-to-year, they're 800,000 - 900,000, something like that in a year where we've been shut down for a couple quarters from some of the activities, the branches, and that\u2019s strong performance we are pressing at all time. The magic has been we've been able to manage expenses between 13, 13.5 a quarter. Now, you\u2019ve got to add the merchant to it, there's a 13.7, Paul did, and still invest at that rate.  And that's -- look at that page four on the digital growth. It's just -- it's very strong. Our Zelle I think was 30%, all the Zelle transactions, Erica,  and then life plan, this quarter we put out a new product that you can do your own financial plan and 0.5 million customers in a couple weeks. So, across the board and each element of franchise investing $3 billion in technology. So, we're pressing our advantage organically every day, and you're seeing that come out. Our deposit market share across the board has grown and our loan share where we compete has continued to grow and our GTS business has continued to grow. And as Paul said, our investment banking has grown and we're keeping it driving. JimMitchell: That's helpful. And so, you feel comfortable that you can still I mean, add the $200 million to the 13 to 13.5, so 13 to 13.7. You still feel comfortable doing all that and keeping expenses in that range. Brian Moynihan : Yes, it just, that's this operational excellence platform, if you look at whatever page that was, look at all those quarters. And you go back even before that, it's been and think of all the investments we've made, make I think that's three years that we show you maybe so think a $10 billion, $9 billion to $10 billion in technology development, code development, new initiatives, and that too in a period of time and expenses stayed relatively flat. Think about redeploying, probably 300 to 400 or 500 new branches across that decade, across that three to four years in markets, you'd never been, think about refurbishing. We've done 300 or 400 branches this year so far. We've opened in the new market, et cetera. So just this quarter, just this little quarter, we open 13 branches in new markets. So we're pressing our advantage. And the board asked me and I, we'd have the discussions with our major shareholders, if you, could you press it harder, and there's a in the answers, by talk to market people sure, they'd want to spend more money on marketing, but I think we spend enough to do the trick and drive it in the way that stick to the risk. Operator : And we can move next to Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. BetsyGraseck: Hey, good morning. Thanks for the time. I wanted to dig in a little bit on the point you're making Paul earlier about the cash and the redeployment into securities. And I just wanted to get a sense as to 4Q. How much of NIM uplift do you think you're going to get from that? And then what pretty percentage of cash have you used already? What is going to be guiding you on? How much more to use here? And is there a limit for how much cash you're willing to redeploy into securities? PaulDonofrio: Yes, sure. So, in the third quarter, we deposit about $100 billion of our cash into mortgage backed securities and treasuries over the third quarter. And on a weighted average basis between the treasuries mortgage backed securities, that probably produced a lift relative to cash about close to a percentage point on what we deployed. You didn't see a lot of that come through in Q3 because of the timing of those purchases throughout the quarter; you'll see more of that impact in Q4. With respect to future deployment, we have some firepower left. I hesitate to give you a number but call it maybe another $100 billion-ish, I'm not telling you, we're going to deploy all of that in the fourth quarter. We're continuing to access deposit and will likely continue to deploy more cash, very likely to deploy more cash into securities moving forward, but no answer right yet exactly how much. The size and the pace of that will be influenced by a number of judgments, including things like loan demand and customer deposit behavior. And we'll also balance the mix of purchases as we assess the trade-offs between capital, liquidity and earning. BetsyGraseck: The one percentage point you're talking about as in is the yield left on the portfolio versus cash. PaulDonofrio: No. That is, if you compare what we're buying mortgage backed security, treasuries to what we were earning in cash or repo. The pick up in yield on that investment is a little less than 1%. BetsyGraseck: Yes. Okay. Yes, I got it. All right. And then maybe, if you could speak a little bit to both yourself and Brian, to the discussion around the C&I loan utilization, and I get that we're at a historic low or close to the lows and utilization. But what is it that you're seeing in your customer discussions that gives you an expectation that you could see that start to left in for Q1 and into 2021. Brian Moynihan : So what we see is it just isn't -- hasn't been going down, it kind of ran down throughout second quarter in the first quarter, we have panic bar, people drawing the lines, and then it ran down. And so some of these companies are making more cash flow than they've ever made in. So what you're starting to see is a couple things. One is in areas like auto, retail dealers, and stuff that the inventories are going to have to build; they're also going to have nothing to sell. So they'll build those back up, you're seeing it in suppliers of parts and things, they're building their inventories that are seeing more final demand on the products that sustain and that I think that the key, so it's more just talking to people and seeing that, frankly, that they brought it down about as far as they can, from sort of the day-to-day operational basis, when you start to think of $50 million revenue companies running the numbers that Paul gave you, which is what we call business banking. They can't get it much lower neck because they are paying their payrolls and doing other things.  And so they're going to start to build back up as they start to expand to meet their client demands. And so that's what we get to this conference, just the conversation we had that we've had with them in talking to them in these deep reviews we've done, it's been clear that they're feeling better that the core demand, from May to June to July to August to September picks up. The only big question when you're -- when we're wrong on all this terms of loan balance is really in the high end and who has access to markets and how deep that goes in the middle markets, which would make these on the investment banking side, but that can move the loan balance around as you well know that. Operator : And we can move next to Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. MikeMayo: Hi, this is a follow up to you got pressing your advantage. I mean, it's good news, bad news. Good news is you're growing household, your deposits; the corporation up one fourth year-over-year, your digital banking is growing. So that's great. And your award is, your NII gotten crushed, right. So short term versus long term trade off. Try to look at an environment with lower rates for longer as you acquire these customers. Have you changed your assumptions for a lifetime value because I assume you eventually want to monetize the benefits of the relationship, but it's just not happening yet? Brian Moynihan : So I think, Mike, you have to think about it two ways. One is for the new customers coming on bringing us $100 billion in incremental checking deposits year-over-year. That is money coming on at basically zero that you can redeploy, as Paul said. So there's a value to that incrementally to the company. The question is when you had a quick fall down or rates that we had, if you have to kind of get underneath it come out the other side, as you well know. But, look, the value of the positive franchise represented by having core house of relationships, and that's where you see the things move forward. So what are we seeing? We're seeing a rebound in our auto lending; we're seeing a rebound in our card lending. Those are coming because we have the core relationships that are digitally inactive, 50% of the sales are coming digitally. And that helps us grow. And then you think about just on the consumer, look at, if you look at page 15 on the investment side, you're seeing that build up by $40 billion year-over-year, $20 billion linked quarter.  So that materialize the balance and the good news is you've looked at the fee structure, across the platforms and the different things you're seeing the fees start to come back up, which is just core activity. So, you only have $200 million, $225 million in total quarterly deposit interest. So it can only go from 225 to zero, there's not much left. And it was a billion  that in class year this quarter. So we brought that down. And now we just got to grow the volume back out, and you're seeing that start to happen. And that's what gives Paul comfort from the over rejections. And it's the depth of relationship; it's not any single product, as you well know. We're pressing the advantage because frankly, even at a low rate environment, more core deposit customers, more core checking accounts than deposit, in addition to our wealth management business in GUM, more TTS business we will make more money on it. You might get a twist of rates in a given quarter, but just think back. We had this discussion in the mid 2000s. 2013, 2014, 2015 year, you saw the earnings come up even before the rates move. MikeMayo: And the rates, yes, we know, this typical linchpin to a customer relationship is just getting value today for that relationship, and you're mentioning the different products. Is there a way to think about charging more fees or something? If you have a low rate environment like this, again, it's getting your money's worth more or the effort you've put into gathered these new households? Brian Moynihan : Yes, well, I think, not penalty fees clearly, Mike, does that just as a bad customer experience, because the other thing is the attrition rate and the book is dropped at a very low because the high quality customer experience our team delivers, then it gives you the permission to do more with them. So penalty fees, I think, are not the way to go. But core account fees for the structures are there and but the reality is most of is our preferred book, which is 80% of the consumer deposits by definition, is way above any minimum requirement for fees. And so you've got the volume, you get 80% of consumer deposits in a book with only about 20% of customers, so you make it up in your expenses and your operating capacity there. And that's what -- that's how you ultimately make it up even the low rate environment is just the sheer. We have 4,300 branches in this franchise, Mike, in 1999, we had 4,800 distributors. PaulDonofrio: And I think Mike you deepened with them, you deepened with them, in loans, you deepen with them in wealth management. And we're making progress in all those areas. Operator : And we can move next to Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. MattO'Connor: Good morning. I want to follow up on expenses. You talked about $13.7 billion in the fourth quarter. And I just wanted to figure out like is that still an elevated number from COVID? And because if you analyze it, and yes, the 1Q is seasonal bump, you're kind of call it mid $55 billion range for next year. Which feels high but I want to give you guys a benefit of doubt. PaulDonofrio: Yeah. I think the three points, the $13.7 billion roughly $13.7 billion to 4Q that probably include net COVID expenses of $300 million to $400 million. MattO'Connor: Okay and how do you think about the timing of that $300 million to $400 million coming off? I guess it can be tricky that everybody assuming at this point. PaulDonofrio: $300 million or $400 million, right, on the $300 million to $400 million per quarter. I mean, in the fourth quarter, it was higher this quarter. But in the fourth quarter it kind of baked into that number is $300 million to $400 million of net COVID expensive. So that'll come off, over 2021 and we'll get more of it at the end of the year than we were on beginning of the year, but it'll, I don't know, ratably come down. I can't, I would expect maybe half of that to be in the fourth quarter of  on a full year basis. MattO'Connor: Okay then a separate on upon net income, you talked about a moving higher in 2021? I assume that's on a linked-quarter basis, and obviously from day down and challenges in the third quarter, but maybe just elaborate a bit on the outlook for net interest income for next year, based on the assumptions that you have. PaulDonofrio: Sure, look, we are not providing any specific guidance. I'll give you a few thoughts for next year. Obviously, the lower reinvestment yields are expect to continue that's going to impact NII but that headwind early in the year should be offset by the deployment of the cash into securities. And then by the middle year, we're hopeful that loan growth will be a tailwind as the economy recovers. So we think NII should move forward and up from here. MattO'Connor: If I work in that math and think about, again, to adjust for the day count and some of those nuances. Would your expectation be that net interest income dollars in 3Q of next year be higher than this year? PaulDonofrio: Yes. I mean 3Q to 3Q? MattO'Connor: Yes. PaulDonofrio: Yes. I'd have to think of it, I'd have to look at that. I mean, certainly higher than, yes, I would say that would affect the 3Q next year, it will be higher than 3Q this year. Yes. Operator : And we can move next to John McDonald with Autonomous Research. JohnMcDonald: Hi, Paul, two NII questions just near term. So it sounds like you might be expecting a little bit of lift net of all the factors you talked about in NII in the fourth quarter or kind of flattish up a little, just kind of what's the near term outlook on NII. PaulDonofrio: So the near term outlook is, as I said, it's going to be we think, at least flat and we're optimistic is going to be up. So we think we're at the low point 3 for NII. We've got the ones of reinvestment on, on security. And we've got the lower average loan balances, given we're ending this quarter on loan balances. But we think those headwinds are going to be offset by the deployment of the excess cash that we've done. And we'll probably continue to do in the fourth quarter. So for at least flat and optimistic up. JohnMcDonald: Okay, and how, when you think about redeploying cash rates are still very low today, what -- how do you balance the risk of locking in low yields and duration risk, against looking to protect NII? And thinking loan growth might come back; you expressed some optimism there. PaulDonofrio: Yes, it's a very good question. We are always balancing our liquidity, capital and earnings. I want to go into a lot of detail, but we are maintaining the assets sensitivity of the company with these purchases. JohnMcDonald: Okay, and then one nitpick here in the other income category, the net loss and noninterest income minus $250 million. So you mentioned, tax advantaged investments and other things, is that kind of what we should expect going forward, and you're getting the benefit in the tax rate, but this other income kind of runs it a little bit of a losses, or there's some other issues there. PaulDonofrio: Yes, no, I think that I would expect that. I think other income is going to bounce around quarter-to-quarter, but it should on average, be down a couple of hundred million, given, as you said, the investment in our renewable energy products and other ESG efforts, which create partnership losses. JohnMcDonald: Okay. So that's kind of a new runway for that. PaulDonofrio: And remember in the fourth quarter, those partnership losses are always higher. So think maybe a couple hundred million higher. JohnMcDonald: Okay, more than the $250 million this quarter. PaulDonofrio: Yes, but we get the benefit in the tax line throughout the year. JohnMcDonald: Yes, 10% for the fourth quarter. And do you have an idea of like tax rate for annual basis going forward with this new arrangement? PaulDonofrio: I don't have an expectation for next year to share with you. But the fourth quarter absent unusual items, 10%. And I would just remind everybody that these tax advantaged investments are things we're doing to help society. We're talking about low income housing; we're talking about wind and solar. These are things that are part of our ESG effort. Yes, we are a militaristic company. But on the other hand, we're also doing it because it's a good business for us and helps us generate the benefits net of the cost of losses are positive the company's earnings. Operator : And we can move next to Ken Usdin with Jefferies. KenUsdin: Thanks. Good morning, guys. I was wondering if you could elaborate a little bit more on just your expectations for just how the last cycle is going to evolve? Paul, I believe you mentioned that wouldn't expect losses to really start moving up until mid year, next year. And as we start to evaluate whether or not and how much stimulus we get versus what we've already gotten baked in the cake. Just how are you expecting to see both the consumer and the commercial side project us as we move forward? Thanks. PaulDonofrio: Yes, sure. So look, regarding the charge-offs, I think we've covered but in consumer, given the lack of significant delinquencies we've seen so far, even on those customers will come off deferral. And given the fact that net charge-offs don't occur without bankruptcy until 100 days past due, it's just not likely, we're going to see consumer net charge-offs, which show up until kind of mid to 2020 at mid 2021. Brian Moynihan : Yes. If you go back and think about it, what we thought was going to happen third quarter this year pushed out going back to the first quarter we looked at then the second quarter, we looked at we pushed out further, the third quarter, we pushed out further, so it just keeps pushing out based on frankly the characteristics of our consumers are stronger than the characteristics generally in the United States, and characteristics of United States are their consumers are doing better, because of all the things you mentioned, than the unemployment statistics would indicate in models. And so it's just pushed it out. And but it's now in the second half of next year. KenUsdin: Yeah, I guess I am just trying to wonder -- sorry, go ahead. Brian Moynihan : But remember, the near-term path of charge-offs is going to be driven by delinquency roll and things like that, if the -- what's delinquency at the end of this quarter. And as Paul said, the 30 day delinquencies are down year-over-year and mortgages and cards and things like that, it's down as a percent and down as dollar amount and down as a percent on a smaller balance. So it's, their credit quality has been strong. KenUsdin: Yes. And you made the point about not being quite clear yet on, if you should release reserves, just given the uncertainties, I guess, how much is future stimulus a part of that equation? What do you look forward to kind of get that comfort zone that you can say, I know, you said the builds are done, but just in terms of starting to utilize and feel comfortable that you can lead even more of those reserves kind of flow back into capital? Brian Moynihan : There were -- so a stimulus plan would help the unemployed, the businesses, they're still struggling to get their business capacity -- to get their business utilization of those obvious businesses, you all know, and then states and towns, so they don't have further reduction in budgets or, and/or in schools and other things, hospitals, all these people have been heavily affected. Stimulus affecting those would help all these speed up the pace of the estimates coming down, quite frankly. Right now, there's hasn't been -- right now there's -- it's not baked in, as Paul said earlier, but if stimulus coming in, it would move us further, and you'd see the reserves come out further, because their lifetime expectation of loss would be lower. It's kind of the way it works for less. Operator : And we will move next to Charles Peabody with Portales. Your line is open. CharlesPeabody: Yes, two quick questions. And your guidance on no more reserve builds. I'm trying to make sure I understand that because you've also talked about the possibility of loan growth. So at the very least, you'll cover charge-offs but we also provide for loan growth. Brian Moynihan : We would but just think about a couple of percentage of loan growth given the level of reserving wouldn't change it dramatically. So if we had fast loan growth, which I don't think economy is going to support in the near term, we'd have to grow faster, but that'd be a high quality problem to have to build reserves for loan growth. CharlesPeabody: Sure. And then the second question is can you give us some color on the pipeline for investment banking? What that looks like versus the second quarter or the year ago fourth quarter? PaulDonofrio: Yes, the pipeline looks solid for investment banking; again, the second quarter was a record quarter for us. And the third quarter was the second best quarter for us. So investment banking normally down sequentially third quarter, the fourth quarter. And I don't think you could expect to see the same type of volume in the fourth quarter that we saw in the second quarter or perhaps the third quarter, but the pipeline looks solid. And we're even seeing some M&A pickup in or at least from a discussion standpoint. Brian Moynihan : And Tom Montag and I have been very pleased with the work that Matthew Koder has done with their team over the last year and a half or so that since he took over and just driving great coverage, driving great connectivity to our middle market businesses, and the fees there are continue to grow. And so they've done -- he's done a very good job of the management team in that business and we'd expect him to keep making progress. PaulDonofrio: Yes, we've gone from just a middle market alone, we've gone from fourth to second in a year with 9.5% market share; we talked about market share gains earlier. Operator : And this does conclude the question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the program over to Brian Moynihan for any closing remarks. Brian Moynihan : So number one; thank you all for joining us and your interest in our company. Second; a solid quarter of $5 billion plus in earnings, nearly $5 billion in earning, $0.51 a share. Good business progress across the board in terms of client activity and client household growth. And also we saw the economy continued to progress in terms of our customer spending, and it continued to see that continue in October. So nearly $5 billion in earnings, solid, very strong capital, very strong liquidity, continuing our responsible growth manager. Thank you. Operator : Thank you for your participation. This does conclude today's program. You may disconnect at any time.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, everyone and welcome to today's Bank of America Fourth Quarter Earnings Announcement's Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later you will have the opportunity to ask questions during the question-and-answer session.  Please note, today's call is being recorded. And it's now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Lee McEntire. Please go ahead. Lee McEntire : Good morning. Welcome and thank you for joining the call to review our fourth quarter results. I hope by now you've all had a chance to review the earnings release documents. As usual they're available including the earnings presentation that we'll be referring to during the call on the Investor Relations section of bankofamerica.com\u2019s website. Brian Moynihan : Thank you, Lee and good morning to all of you and thank you for joining us today. Before I pass the call to Paul to review the fourth quarter, I want to hit a few points. First I want to provide some brief commentary on 2020 for the full year then talk about what we see in the economy as we enter 2021, and then highlight some areas where I believe we made strong strategic progress that will drive momentum into 2021 and beyond. So starting on slide two. 2020 was a tough operating environment as you all know. In that period, we generated net income of nearly $18 billion or $1.87 in EPS and earned a return above our cost of capital. Our EPS was down 32% compared to 2019 driven by the impacts of coronavirus pandemic on the company and the economy. As you know, the Fed dropped rates to nearly zero. Longer rates also fell to historic lows. Loan demand surged and then waned as the panic subsided. That reduced net interest income. But as we told you last quarter that we believed that NII had likely bottomed in the third quarter of 2019. In fact, we saw a modest improvement this quarter which Paul will cover later despite the challenges from lower loans. Non-interest revenue declined slightly, but included some interesting dynamics highlighting diversity of Bank of America's model. Consumer fees declined driven by the activity levels of clients, but also by higher account balances and customer accounts. That's a good thing for the economy going forward. Our business mix allowed us to benefit from more market-related activities in sales and trading, investment banking and investment brokerage in the wealth management businesses. Our full year revenue of $15 billion from sales and trading rose 17% and we generated more than $7 billion of Investment Banking revenues this year an increase of 27% over last year. Paul Donofrio : Thanks, Brian. Hello everyone. I'm starting on slide 6 and 7 together. As I did last quarter, I will mostly compare our results relative to Q3, as most investors we speak with are more interested in our progress as we transverse the pandemic rather than in comparison to pre-pandemic periods. In Q4, we earned $5.5 billion or $0.59 per share, which compares to $4.9 billion or $0.51 a share in Q3. Compared to Q3, the earnings improvement was driven by lower provision expense, as we released $828 million in reserves, nearly offsetting net charge-offs, which also declined. Also benefiting earnings, expenses declined $474 million from Q3 on lower litigation costs, and NII moved from the Q3 trough. Non-interest income declined from Q3, but results across individual line items were mixed. First, the decline in other income was driven by seasonal client activity with respect to ESG investments, which created higher partnership losses, but benefited our annual tax rate, as I have described in previous discussions. Our tax rate for the year was 6%. If we adjust for the tax benefit of our portfolio of ESG investments, our tax rate would have been roughly 21%. I point this out to emphasize that the full year tax benefits of the socially responsible investments more than offset the portion of losses recorded in other income throughout the year. Relative to Q3, non-interest income was also impacted by lower sales and trading, which typically slows from Q3 to Q4. But, while sales and trading revenue was down linked-quarter, year-over-year it was up 7%. On the positive side, non-interest income benefited from higher asset management fees as the market improved. And we grew net new households again this year. And finally, we had another good quarter of Investment Banking revenue, which increased from both the strong Q3 levels and year-over-year. Also when comparing net income to Q3, remember, the Q3 tax expense benefited by $700 million from the revaluation of our UK deferred tax asset. Finally with respect to returns, note that our ROTCE was 11.7% and our ROA approached 80 basis points. Moving to slide 8, the balance sheet expanded $81 billion versus Q3 to $2.8 trillion in assets, total assets. The main point is that deposits are driving and funding substantially all of this growth. Deposits grew $93 billion in the quarter and are up $361 billion from Q4 2019. On the other hand, loans declined from Q3. With deposits up, loans down, excess liquidity is piling up in our cash and securities portfolios. Global Liquidity sources are up $367 billion year-over-year and $84 billion just from Q3. In fact, Global Liquidity is up so much that it now exceeds total loans. With respect to regulatory ratios, the standardized approach remains binding at 11.9% consistent with Q3. Shareholders' equity increased $4 billion, as earnings were more than three times the amount of common dividends paid plus we issued preferred stock totaling $1.1 billion. But, this was offset by higher RWA, as we invested more cash in securities. At 11.9%, our CET1 ratio is 240 basis points above our minimum requirement, which equates to a $36 billion capital cushion. Our TLAC ratio also increased and remains comfortably above our requirements. Before leaving the balance sheet, as usual, we provide the charts on slide 9 and 10 to show the historical trends with respect to average loans and deposits. For reference, we included these same charts on an end-of-period basis in the appendix. Overall, year-over-year, total loans are down 4%. And in the lines of business, they are down 2%. The decline year-over-year was driven by lower revolver utilization and other paydowns in commercial and by pullback in credit card activity. On slide 10 we provide the same trends by line of business for deposits. Brian already made a number of points on deposits and you can see the tremendous year-over-year growth in every line of business that led to 23% growth in deposits for the company. At $1.7 trillion in deposits far surpasses any previous record for deposits. We believe our strong deposit growth reflects our customers' overall experience with us, as we continue to innovate around digital capabilities, as well as enhance our nationwide physical footprint of financial centers and ATMs, which have continued to prove important to customers and clients. I will just add that, given historically low interest rates, our rate paid on deposits declined modestly linked-quarter and we are now lower than the rate paid to customers in 2015 before the Fed began raising rates. And I will point out that our interest cost on $1.7 trillion of deposits this quarter was only $159 million. Turning to slide 11 and net interest income. On a GAAP non-FTE basis NII in Q4 was $10.25 billion, $10.37 billion on an FTE basis, while net interest income declined  million from Q3. The improvement from Q3 was driven by the increased deployment of excess deposits into securities. Lower loan balances, lower reinvestment rates and modestly higher mortgage-backed securities premium write-offs mitigated the improvement in NII. The net interest yield was relatively stable, declining only one basis point from the Q3 level. Note that given all the deposit growth, plus the low starting point with respect to interest rates, our asset sensitivity to rising rates remains quite large and is a good reminder of the value of these deposit relationships. Now with respect to NII. As we move into 2021, we offer the following perspectives. Our perspective on NIIs assume that net interest rates follow the forward curve and do not move lower than current levels and that the economy does not take a meaningful step backwards as a result of recent negative COVID developments. With that said, first I would remind everyone that Q1 will be impacted by two less days of interest, which is a headwind of nearly $200 million. Also, seasonally, we would expect to see payments related to holiday spending result in lower card balances. We also have the continuing impact of higher-yielding assets maturing or paying off and being replaced with lower-yielding ones. Offsetting these headwinds we currently intend to again invest a portion of our excess deposits which continued to grow in Q4 into securities. Having listed those specific Q1 impacts, NII improvement, more generally, will depend on all the factors we are all focused on such as loan growth, PPP loan forgiveness and PPP new originations and mortgage refinancings, as well as mortgage-backed security payment speeds, which impact the write-off of bond premiums. Should those trends develop in a positive way, our NII and earnings will benefit. One final note on NII. We added a slide in the appendix that shows the difference between 2015 when short-term rates were last this low and today. The important difference between then and now is the growth in our balance sheet which improved NII and the decline in expenses since then. Speaking of expenses and turning to slide 12. Q4 expenses were $13.9 billion; $474 million lower than Q3. The decline was driven by a reduction in litigation expense. We also saw a reduction in COVID-related expenses, primarily those associated with processing claims for unemployment insurance. Higher planned marketing costs across the firm and revenue-related processing and incentives mitigated the reductions. As we move into 2021, remember, Q1 will include seasonally higher payroll tax expense, which we estimate at roughly $350 million. Given the resurgence of COVID cases across the U.S. and in Europe, we estimate that $300 million to $400 million of net COVID-related expense remained in our Q4 expenses. We continue to work hard to lower these types of expense, but not at the expense of the safety of our employees and customers. And outside of these COVID costs, we continue to manage expense tightly, using gains in productivity and digital activity to mitigate other increases. Turning to asset quality on slide 13. Our total net charge-offs this quarter were $881 million, or 38 basis points of average loans. Net charge-offs continued to benefit from years of responsible growth, as well as government stimulus and loan deferral programs. A $91 million decline in net charge-offs was driven by lower credit card losses. The loss rate on credit card declined to a 20-year low of 206 basis points of average loans. Provision expense was $53 million, which not only reflected an improvement in macroeconomic projections, but also incorporated uncertainties that remain in the economy due to the health crisis. These considerations resulted in an $838 million reserve release this quarter, reducing consumer loan reserves by $621 million and commercial by $207 million. Our allowance as a percentage of loans and leases ended the year at 2.04%, which is well above the 1.27% where we began the year, following our day one adoption of the CECL accounting standards. With respect to key variables used in setting our reserve. As done in previous quarters, we continued to include a number of downside scenarios. Based on our Q4 2020 weighting of those scenarios, GDP is forecasted to return to its Q4 2019 level in the early part of 2022. This improved by a couple of quarters relative to Q3. The weighting scenario also resulted in an unemployment rate at the end of 2021, consistent where it is today, just north of 6.5%. On slide 14 we break out credit quality metrics for both our consumer and commercial portfolios. On the consumer front, COVID's effects on net charge-offs continued to remain benign. Overall, consumer net charge-offs declined $82 million, driven by card losses and remained near historic lows. We experienced modest increases in delinquency and NPL levels, but they remained low and were expected, given the deferral activity of customers. While expired deferrals drove consumer 30-day delinquency modestly higher compared to Q3, importantly, they remain 22% below the year-ago level. And, consumer deferral balances continued to decline in Q4, ending the year at $8 billion. Moreover, balances are now mostly consumer real estate-related with strong underlying collateral values. We added a slide in our appendix which further highlights delinquency trends for credit card. It shows a modest bulge of the expected deferral-related delinquencies moving their way through time and into the 90-plus bucket at year-end. As the bulge of deferral-related delinquencies passed through time periods, delinquencies receded. As an example, in Q4, five-day delinquencies were down more than 30% year-over-year which shows that after deferrals passed through this time period, delinquencies fell and stayed lower. So, assuming net losses follow their historical relationship to delinquencies in the 90-plus day bucket and no other changes in card payment trends, we would expect card losses to be higher in Q1 but then decline in Q2. Moving to commercial, net charge-offs were relatively flat to Q3 even as we sold some loans in affected industries, crystallizing losses but reducing risk. Overall, given the environment, the asset quality of our commercial loan book remained solid, and 89% of exposures were either investment-grade or collateralized. Our reservable criticized exposure metric continue to be the most heavily impacted by COVID and increased this quarter by $3 billion from Q3, led by downgrades -- downgraded exposures in commercial real estate primarily hotels. Importantly, commercial NPLs while up modestly, remained low at only 45 basis points of loans. Turning to the business segments and starting with Consumer Banking on slide 15. Consumer Banking throughout 2020, has been the segment most impacted -- most heavily impacted by COVID. It bore the brunt of revenue disruption from interest rates, customer activity and fee waivers. Reserve-building impacted provision expense. And expenses increased for PPP programs and protection of associates and customers. In Q4, compared to Q3, revenue, expenses and provision all improved. We earned six -- $2.6 billion in Consumer Banking in Q4 versus $2.1 billion in Q3. But with earnings still below prior year pre-pandemic levels, we know we still have plenty of room for improvement. Client momentum in this business continued to show strength around deposits and investment flows, while near-term loan growth was -- has been impacted by the decline in mortgage balances from heightened refinance activity. Looking at the components of the P&L linked-quarter, revenue growth included both higher NII and fees. Consumer fees reflected an increased level of holiday spending as well as higher investment account activity. Even as revenue moved higher expenses moved modestly lower, as we had a reduction in pandemic costs and continued to realize the benefits of a more digitally engaged customer base. As Brian noted, and as you can see on slide 17, we saw an improvement in digital enrollment. Most importantly, customer use of our digital capabilities increased with not only more sign-ons and higher digital sales, but also more service fulfillment through digital channels as reflected by volume growth in both Erica and Zelle. Note also that, both our rate paid and cost of deposit declined. Cost of deposits is now 135 basis points. In the past year, we added over 500,000 net new checking accounts grew deposits 23% and dropped our cost of deposits 17 basis points, even with the increase in costs associated with the pandemic. Let's skip to Wealth Management on slide 18 and 19. And I will refer to both slides, as I speak. Okay. Here again the impact of lower rates on a large deposit book pressured NII, impacting an otherwise solid quarter with positive AUM flows, market appreciation and solid deposit and loan growth. Net income of $836 million improved 12% from Q3, as revenue growth and improvement in provision exceeded, a modest increase in expense. With respect to revenue, NII grew driven by solid growth of both loans and deposits. And asset management fees grew to a new record on higher market valuations and solid flows. Expenses increased driven by revenue-related expense and investments in our sales force. Merrill Lynch and the Private Bank both continue to grow households, as we remain a provider of choice for affluent clients. Client balances rose to a record of more than $3.3 trillion up $302 billion year-over-year driven by higher market levels as well as positive client flows. Let's move to our Global Banking results on slide 20. COVID has also heavily impacted Global Banking due to lower interest rates, softer loan demand and higher credit costs. But here, again we saw improvement. The business earned nearly $1.7 billion in Q4 improving $751 million from Q3 driven by lower provision expense and improved revenue. On a year-over-year basis, earnings were $341 million lower, driven by NII. Looking at revenue and comparing to Q3, revenue improvement was driven by higher Investment Banking fees as well as more leasing activity associated with our clients' ESG investments. Investments Banking fees for the company of nearly $1.9 billion grew 5% from Q3 and were up 26% year-over-year. As Brian noted, this performance led to improved market share overall and in a number of key products. Provision expense reflected a reserve release of $266 million in Q4, compared to a build in reserves of $555 million in Q3. Non-interest expense was higher compared to the linked quarter and year-over-year, primarily reflecting investments in the platform as well as support for the PPP program and also reflecting the recording of merchant services expense, given the change in accounting versus the year-ago quarter. As Brian noted earlier, customers continued to appreciate the ease, safety and convenience of our digital banking capabilities. And usage continued to grow, helping defray other costs. We present some digital highlights on slide 22. As noted earlier, loans declined but saw stabilization late in the quarter. And continuing to trend since Q2, the spread of the loan portfolio continued to tick higher as spreads on new originations on average exceeded the average spread of the portfolio. Average deposits increased 26% relative to Q3 as businesses remained highly liquid. Okay. Switching to Global Markets on slide 23. Results reflect solid year-over-year improvement in revenue from sales and trading, but declined from the robust levels of Q3. As I usually do, I will talk about segment results, excluding DVA. This quarter net DVA was a small loss of $56 million. On that basis, Global Markets produced $834 million of earnings in Q4, a decline from the more robust trading in Q3, but up markedly from Q4 2019. Focusing on year-over-year revenue was up 13% on higher sales and trading. The year-over-year expense increase was driven by higher activity-based costs for both trading and unemployment claims processing. Sales and trading contributed $3.1 billion to revenue increasing 7% year-over-year, driven by a 30% improvement in equities and a 5% decline in FICC. The strength in equities was driven by market volatility and investment repositioning, which drove client activity higher. The decline in FICC reflected strong credit trading performance, which was more than offset by declines across most macro products and mortgage trading. As Brian noted, the year-over-year performance of this business has been strong in every quarter of 2020. You can see that on slide 24 and that produced strong segment returns of 15% on allocated capital for the year. Okay. Finally on slide 25, we show All Other which reported a loss of $425 million. Compared to Q3 the decline in net income, was driven primarily by the prior quarter's tax benefit of $700 million associated with our U.K. deferred tax asset. Revenue declined from Q3 driven by the accounting for wind and solar and other ESG investments. We also experienced some modest equity investment losses. Expenses declined from Q3 on lower litigation expense, but were partially offset by higher marketing costs. For 2021, absent any changes in the current tax laws or unusual items, we would expect the effective tax rate to be in the low double digits driven by the level of ESG client activity relative to pre-tax earnings. And with that, I'll turn it back to Lee and Brian for Q&A. Operator :  We'll take our first question today from John McDonald with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead. John McDonald : Hi. Good morning. I wanted to ask a question on expenses. Brian mentioned expecting the cost number to be flattish in 2021 versus 2020. Just kind of wondering, is that all-in expenses Paul or some kind of core metric? If you could give an outlook for the expenses that you expect and the COVID -- trend for COVID expenses this year? Thanks. Brian Moynihan : Yes, John that's all in given the -- so around $55 billion both years since we feel good about the ability to keep bringing down COVID. It came out a little slower this quarter largely, due to the fact that, if you go back and think where we were in October on case counts the need to continue to provide strong benefits to our teammates, including the child care in their homes so they could be effective that's why we get those customer scores, and why the growth in checking sales was 70%, 80% of a normal year even with half to 40% of the branches closed. So, yes, flat year-over-year all-in number. And then we're working the dynamics underneath it. But importantly remember, we are investing $3.5 billion in technology next year, new financial centers expansion employees to help sell more, and we'll continue to drive it through. So you'll see sort of a change in the COVID cost coming down hopefully as we move through the year, but we've got some work to do, but flat over year-over-year overall. John McDonald : Okay. And then longer term Brian, you've talked about getting back to a low $54 billion as kind of a run rate ex-COVID. Is that still how you're thinking about things? Brian Moynihan : Yes. We should start to work down. Again either, as we said many years ago, as we get in the out years and get more and more efficient the day-to-day the quotidian costs of rent increases and payroll pay increases work at you. But the idea is to have the net expense grow sort of at 1% a year. So, 3% up from just day-to-day cost to manage a couple of percents out and so we'll continue to work that down in the future. We've got work to do on getting these COVID expenses out of here. John McDonald : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Mike Mayo : Hi. I also wanted to follow-up on the efficiency. I mean, you're making big strides with digital banking in so many ways with 39 million digital households are engaged. And you go through all those metrics and you see efficiency ratio for the quarter of 69%. And if you take out your $400 million of COVID cost, maybe it would be 67%, but that's still a far cry from the 57% to 59% where you had been. I know low rates hurt a little bit, but either you're investing more than your -- you've disclosed. Or are there some other COVID costs in there? Or you're not getting -- becoming more efficient as you said in your opening comments Brian. So help me kind of reconcile your current efficiency or my adjusted efficiency ratio with a more normal level. Brian Moynihan : So Mike, I take you back to page 11 on the net interest yield, and net interest income, and realize that basically in the four quarters of last year we lost $2 billion of revenue per quarter, which is the bridge from -- a lot of that bridge. And so as we work that back up and ultimately as rates rise that $2 billion that's per quarter so $8 billion in revenue, with really no cost. That will go up. So we continue to get more efficient in the branch as the cost of operating over the deposit base is now at 1.35%, and we added 700,000 of checking accounts. So you're right it's -- but it's more affected by the revenue impact to NII than it is by anything else in terms of expenses. Remember, we're saying net COVID cost of $300 million or $400 million. That includes offsetting against that whole savings on travel and stuff. The gross costs are obviously much higher than that. We've got about -- just we opened up PPP today. We've got 5,000 employees ready to go to complete the next round of PPP and the forgiveness process. And as that finishes off that stuff will come out of the system. So we got you. Mike Mayo : And then the follow-up to that is going to NII. I'm not sure, if you gave a specific outlook or not Paul, when you went through that. I mean, as you said liquidity is now greater than loans. Your loan-to-deposit ratio at close to 50%, I think it's the lowest in history like ever right now. So there's a lot of dry powder there. But did you give guidance for NII for this year assuming the forward yield curve stays where it is? And, do you think you can somehow pull out positive operating leverage this year? Or is that too tough given the rate environment? Paul Donofrio : We didn't give specific guidance. I can give you a little more color on our perspectives on 2021. But I do think as you think about how you want to estimate and model NII and how it may unfold in 2021, I think it's really sort of helpful to kind of review the progress we made in 2020. There's a lot of clues there. Remember in Q1 of '20, interest rates fell to historically low levels. Short rates were down 150 and long rates were down 100 basis points plus loans declined significantly beginning in Q2 as demand weakened and larger companies accessed the capital markets to pay down debt and build liquidity.  In the past, when we've had situations like this where interest rates and/or loans have declined, it's always taken sort of several quarters to reach a point where renewed balance sheet growth was significant enough to compensate. We believe we found that NII bottom in Q3 and NII indeed moved higher in Q4. All else equal day count et cetera, it should become easier from here to grow NII. I think what helped us to start to grow again quickly in this crisis was the tremendous influx of deposits and our relatively recent confidence to invest the excess in securities instead of holding that excess in cash.  So our continued investment of that cash in Q4 leads us to believe that we can offset the headwinds of low loan demand in the near-term recent -- reinvestment yields and two less days of NII in Q1, leaving NII relatively flat in Q1 versus Q4 before moving up through the balance of the year. Remember in Q2 and Q3, we picked back up those days of interest we lost in Q1. As Brian reviewed, we also saw commercial loans stabilize at the end of Q4 providing hope that increased loan demand will soon follow. Given that we expect some loan demand through the year and using the existing rate curve, which has steepened over the past 90 days, we would expect NII in Q4 2021 for example to be much higher than Q1 2021. And when we get to the second half of 2021, year-over-year quarterly comparisons to 2020 as well as the second half of 2021 compared to the first half of '20 should be quite favorable. Mike Mayo : Okay. That's helpful. And then when you say a lot higher in Q4 than Q1, bigger than a bread box? Or I mean any sizing to that? Paul Donofrio : I would -- Brian Moynihan : Once we get the -- the simple way to think about it, Mike, is once you sort of get underneath the levels, you start growing the loan growth. And we said, we'll outgrow the economy in loan growth in normalized times and in FD, NII. So \u2013 yeah, but we've got to work it back up from here. It's a four or five quarter fight to kind of get this huge balance sheet turn and repositioned and just fight it down and then to have it grow back out. So we'll see. Mike Mayo : Okay. Thank you. Operator : And our next question is from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Please go ahead. Glenn Schorr : Hi. Thanks very much. You guys are pretty predictable and steady on this front. But I'm curious on your thoughts on capital. I don't -- I'm not sure your CET1 has ever been higher and your requirements are not going up. So as capital continues to build and your G-SIB target is reasonably low relative to your big peers. Just what are you thinking in terms of how aggressive do you get on the capital return versus we don't talk much about bolt-on acquisitions with you, but curious how you think about that? And if you might address asset management in particular given your great distribution franchise. Thanks. Brian Moynihan : Glenn, let's go backwards to that one. The big leverage point would be more deposit acquisitions in markets we're not and stuff like that, but we can't do it. It's illegal and has been for all the way back since GLBA or whatever it was 20, 30 years ago so or even before\u2013. And then asset management, remember, we sold asset management because we believed that being the large distributor is the priority. So don't expect us -- we look at stuff from time-to-time like everybody does. But the way we're going to -- we built this company was organic growth and then delivering the capital back to the shareholders. And what's interesting, we'll see what the rules change. But remember that things like the SLR and the accommodations that were given, we didn't need and we have plenty of SLR. It doesn't have any constraint. It doesn't become an issue. Like you said even if you look at the SCB recalcs and stuff we've got plenty over that. So we will be aggressive on returning capital. We got basically two months to return those $3 billion and change we've got to return now. And then we'll see what the Fed instructions are and then we'll get after it as we move forward. And we look at things from time-to-time, but they -- there just isn't much to consider in the United States right now and the best answer is to continue development of this franchise on an organic basis and it works. If you look in the markets, we've expanded our brand system too. We're averaging $100 million or more in deposits per branch in the ones that have been open a couple of years and moving share up literally year-by-year-by-year. And so we think that that's where we got to keep driving. Glenn Schorr : I appreciate all that. Is there a specific either buffer above the CET1 and/or you want to put it in the $36 billion excess? Where is a natural resting ground? Not tomorrow, but just whenever you get there. Brian Moynihan : Yes. We always said sort of 50 basis points above the relevant binding criterias where you'd start to slow down. But remember, we're basically only getting back to earnings. And so we got a lot of room between us and whatever the requirement is plus 50 basis points. And from time-to-time those move around advance to standardize SLR whatever is binding. But think about that's where the Board targets are. Glenn Schorr : Excellent. Thanks for your reference. Operator : Our next question is from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Matt O'Connor: Good morning. Brian Moynihan : Good morning. Matt O'Connor: Can you talk a bit about the timing of the liquidity deployment in the fourth quarter? I think mortgage rates actually came down. And one can argue if you look out six to 12 months longer-term rates will be higher as kind of vaccines get rolled out and the economy picks up. So obviously, you have tons of deposits, but it's also pretty long-duration assets I would think that you're buying. So if you could talk about that? Paul Donofrio : Yes. You're absolutely right. The 10-year was up in the quarter, but rates of mortgage-backed securities -- well certainly, mortgage rates to customers declined; and rates on mortgage-backed securities I think declined slightly. Having said that, we're always going to balance liquidity capital and returns and profits and we did deploy and as we said on our third quarter call approximately $100 million of our cash into securities. It went into both mortgage-backed securities and some treasuries in the quarter. And we think, that was the right thing to do. We understand the rate structure. We did get probably an improvement on our yield on that $100 billion of approximately 125 basis points. So -- and I would say, we've still got a lot of excess cash, Matt. If you look at our balance sheet, cash grew by $70 billion, $80 billion this quarter. So, I mean that was the growth on top of what we already had net of deployment. So, we still have a lot of room to invest in the future. And we plan to do some more investments in Q2, but we're obviously always looking at the rate environment. Matt O'Connor: And then I guess somewhat related, is there a point where you just say, we don't want some of these deposits? It's better to kind of free up even more capital. Or just have a little bit more of an efficient balance sheet and not have to kind of make some of these tough decisions? Or charge for the deposits? Brian Moynihan : Well, so why -- if a customer comes to you to open a checking account and start a lifetime relationship, you'd never turn that down whether it's a commercial customer or a consumer customer for core deposits. And so, if you look at the growth, we're not bidding for CDs or -- and money markets on the consumer side. You can see that $108 billion of the $160 billion was checking account balance growth. And by the way when rates rose before, we continued our checking account growth and we would expect that to continue because these are core customer relationships. So, if you go back and look as rates rose 2016, 2017, 2018, we continued to grow checking in double-digit type of numbers quarter after quarter after quarter, which means, you're just taking market share. And so on the commercial side the same thing in the GTS business. We are not out in the market taking short-term deposits from people. Haven't been. And that's -- and so this is all real core stuff that we're getting paid to take. And albeit, it gets sandwiched a little bit as the zero floors are hit in the commercial side frankly that services overcome the zero floor, but you'd be hard pressed to turn it down. So, it's not like we have a lot of here's a few billion dollars, can you put it on your balance sheet and give us yield? That just doesn't happen. We don't do that. We turned that down already. Matt O'Connor: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Betsy Graseck : Hey thanks. Paul, just first off a follow-on question to the last one around the reinvestment into securities. Like you mentioned, you did $92 billion or so this past quarter. So, as we're thinking about the NII guidance you just gave, should we be anticipating an increase into the securities book that's above and beyond that roughly $100 million run rate that you did in 4Q? Paul Donofrio : Look, we continue to access -- assess the excess deposits and we do expect to continue to deploy more cash into securities. We're not really planning on disclosing how much more, but there is a meaningful amount in that guidance that we gave you. The size and pace of the purchases are obviously going to be influenced by a number of judgments including things like the -- like expected loan demand and customer deposit behavior. So yes, I mean I'm not going to give you a number, but it's a meaningful increase that we're expecting to do in Q2 -- excuse me in this quarter. Betsy Graseck : Yes. Okay. Got it. And then just separately, in talking about credit, you indicated that the delinquencies are suggesting that your NCOs are going to be coming down Q-on-Q in 2Q. And that's a pretty stunning statement, given that we still have this unemployment rate where it is. Can you just talk a little bit about, what -- why you expect that's happening in your book of business? Do you just have a population that's really not being impacted by the unemployment rate? Maybe you could give us some color there. Paul Donofrio : Sure. Now, I want to correct -- I think I heard you say something -- you may not have said it, but I want to make sure everybody heard it. We expect NCOs for card to be up in  it's not going to be down in Q1. And the reason for that -- yes? Brian Moynihan : Hey Paul. We lost you there for a second just, if you could say what you were saying. Paul Donofrio : Okay. Sorry. What I wanted to make sure everybody heard because, I thought I heard you say something different. We expect net charge-offs for card, which obviously the primary driver of consumer loans, we expect those to be up in Q1 and then decline in Q2. And the uptick -- Betsy Graseck : Yes. That's what I thought I said so sorry about that. Paul Donofrio : Okay. And that expectation is being driven by what we see in the 90-plus bucket in terms of delinquencies. And those delinquencies are -- that have sort of -- if you look at the other buckets, you'll see in the 90-plus bucket, they're higher than the other bucket. And that's the deferrals have worked their way from the five-day to 30-day, the 30 to the 60-day, they're now in the 90 bucket. And we can look back historically and say x percent of our delinquencies in the 90 bucket show up as losses in the next quarter because you get to 180 days. And so, that's all we're seeing. But importantly, when you look behind the 90-day bucket, you don't see the same elevated levels. In fact, if you look at the 30-day bucket, you're down meaningfully year-over-year in terms of levels. So that's why we think, Q2 will have to come down. Probably maybe have to is too strong a word, all else equal, what you think would come down. And the question is really, if you think about it, the people who have been affected by this health crisis, who are unemployed, who have been helped by stimulus, will this new stimulus carry them to the point where they get vaccinated and they get jobs back? And will we ever see those losses? Or will they just be pushed out into future periods? Brian Moynihan : So Betsy, just to give you some extra information, we included. If you look at page 27 of the deck in the appendix and the four charts at the bottom were put in specifically because this question we knew would arise. So, if you look across the buckets and you look from the mid 2019 to the end of '20, you can see the different delinquency buckets are all down, even the 90-plus days down in gross dollar amount year-over-year. But you can see that the -- what people thought was sort of the analogy of a pig through a snake is probably more of a mouse through the snake in that it went up it's still a lower dollar amount. And then it would come back down because, you move from the left to the right side of the page. And if you go back to page 14, you can actually see in the top chart that the total charge-offs in consumer this quarter were $482 million. If you look in the red bars which is the credit card, you can see that they're down dramatically year-over-year in terms of gross dollar amounts and then this will bode well in the future. So when we talk about going back up, they're going up from a level that was much below where they have ever been historically in terms of dollar amounts. And so the last point you made just so you have it is that the unemployment rate in our customer base is below the unemployment rate in American society. And that's just due to the -- especially on the borrowing customer base due to the client selection and being in the prime business. Paul Donofrio : Hey, Betsy, maybe just to complete the conversation with respect to commercial, we have seen increases in reservable criticized, but they haven't -- we haven't seen NPLs increase significantly. They're at 45 basis points of loans right now. So we think commercial losses in future quarters are going to be driven by really company specific events that play out over the coming quarters, and will obviously likely be concentrated in industries more heavily impacted by COVID. I would point out that in this quarter we took some losses as we chose to reduce exposures in industries that were affected by COVID. And that crystallized some losses and showed up in our NCOs this quarter. If we hadn't take those losses, we would have hadn't sold those credits we would have had even lower NCOs in commercial. Betsy Graseck : Yes. Yes. No, I got it. I mean, we're forecasting NCOs peaking some time in the end of 2021. But given your comments maybe the question is have they already peaked, or will they have peaked for you in like 1Q? Brian Moynihan : The care there is to think the consumer is really at this point, sort of, run the course. And the commercial, the reserves have built and the activity may occur in the out quarters. But the consumer runs the course by just straight throughput five to 30, 30 to 60, 60 to 90. So we're showing you the charts that really tell you what's going to happen in the first half and because it's a pretty mathematical calculation. Betsy Graseck : Yes. No, I got it. Impressive. Thank you. Operator : Next question from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Vivek Juneja : Hi, Brian. Hi, Paul. Brian, a question for you. Can you talk a little bit about your FICC trading? You've lost share in 2020 including in 4Q. What are you thinking about this business? What are your plans for it? Brian Moynihan : Well, our plans are to keep running it the way we do. And if you look at it year-over-year, it's an integrated business markets. Jimmy does a good job. It's up -- we showed you on that chart. It's up -- it's one of the highest years it's ever had 15% or whatever it is up year-over-year. So they do a great job. We don't play in certain areas, which run on a given quarter. Interesting enough when they don't run people forget about that. And so we have a more of a stable level of revenue. So if you look on page 24, you'll see that $13.2 billion, $13.3 billion, $12.9 billion, $15.2 billion, so we had a good year. And the FICC was up from $8.4 billion to $9.7 billion in revenue, which is substantial and some of the areas we don't trade in. So we're more credit driven and that's what that drives us versus some of the competitors. We're happy with the business. They do a great job. And it's really there to help drive the connectivity between our issuing clients and our investing clients. And we'll continue to do -- drive it. Paul Donofrio : Can I just add one, happy to see what data you're looking at but I don't think we're losing market share in FICC. I think we're actually gaining market share. And perhaps not as much as we're gaining in equities, but we're gaining market share certainly in the segments where we're investing within FICC. Vivek Juneja : Paul, your growth rates have been below peers. So are you doing that by segment of business like Brian was talking about and passing that out between commodities and macro and credit products, or is it something else? Because certainly if we look at year-on-year growth rates, you've been below your peers through several quarters in 2020. Paul Donofrio : Some of the peers, but not all of the peers. There's lots of peers in Europe\u2026 Vivek Juneja : Right. But the bigger ones -- yes, but -- yes I guess\u2026 Paul Donofrio : I think if you look at global fee pools, you'll see that we are gaining market share in FICC. Vivek Juneja : Okay. Okay. We'll go back and compare with the Europeans. Different question Paul for you. MBS premium amortization expense how much -- what was that this quarter? Paul Donofrio : I don't think we're giving the exact number but it was up. And it did impact, I would say meaningfully NII. From here, we're going to need to see mortgage -- customer mortgage rates stabilize and go higher for that number to stabilize and go higher -- excuse me, for that number to stabilize and go lower. Vivek Juneja : I understood what you meant. Yes. Paul Donofrio : Yes. But if you -- I'll give you this sense of its impact though. If you look at the decline in net interest yield for the company, one-third of it was due to premium amortization in the quarter. Vivek Juneja : And so by a time -- the fourth quarter guide that you were giving us for NII to be much better, how much of a reversal are you forecasting in that MBS premium amortization in that guide? Paul Donofrio : Well, I would look at the forward rates to get it -- for you to estimate that. We're not assuming that it goes up in that guidance. Because if you look at the forward curve, rates by the end of the year are up from where they are today\u2026 Vivek Juneja : Yes, yes. No I was -- yes, my question was how much are you expecting it to decline Paul? I know you do not expect them to grow. Paul Donofrio : I understand you were asking for the dollar amount and I'm not going to give you the dollar amount. Vivek Juneja : Not the dollar amount but any sense of percentage, since you said one-third of the decline came from that. Any sense of -- I'm not asking for a precise element, I'm not expecting that. But any sense. Paul Donofrio : Maybe we can follow-up. I mean, I don't have it off the top of my head. I'll probably give you some sense of how much, what percent of the improvement is from that. But I don't -- I just don't have it off the top of my head. The other thing that I would point out just to keep in mind as you're thinking about the write-off of premium is that it's not just at this point due to the decline in rates. You have to remember that the portfolio has gotten bigger too. Vivek Juneja : Right. But you've been hurt more than others by it. So, obviously, that should turn around for you later in the year if refinance\u2026 Paul Donofrio : Yes. That's a meaningful tailwind if mortgage-backed -- if mortgage rates increase. Vivek Juneja : All right. Thanks. Operator : Next question is from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Ken Usdin : Thanks. Good morning. Just one accounting follow-up for you Paul. Just you mentioned the low double-digit tax rate. And that other fee line for where the ESG investments go through has been pretty volatile, but a pretty big negative number. And I just wanted to see if there's any way you can help us understand just what that looks like when you're helping us understand the tax rate as the other side of it. Paul Donofrio : Yes, sure. I can try to help you with that. I guess, there's two ways to triangulate on it. The -- look at the other income line for the company, okay? And with respect to modeling that line, it's going to bounce around a lot quarter-to-quarter. But for modeling purposes a good assumption going forward absent unusual items would be about a loss of $200 million in that line except the fourth quarter will normally be higher as it was this year given the seasonal increase in partnership investments that we saw this quarter. I can give you a lot more -- there's lots of things in that line item, but the volatility is often driven certainly in the fourth quarter by those partnership losses. Other things in that line are equity investment gains, gains and losses on the sale of debt securities. And there's some mark-to-market income in there on our FVL loans -- our fair value loans and related hedges. So there's going to be volatility in there. I would use a loss of around $200 million per quarter with a larger loss in the fourth quarter. Ken Usdin : Yes. Understood. Okay. Great. And then just a follow-up just on -- you mentioned the progress that has been happening in the franchise as we kind of get a little bit closer to reopening. A lot of those card- and consumer-related fee items are still kind of hanging in there plus or minus. What do we think needs to happen for those to start moving the right way? Obviously, you've got all this excess liquidity still weighing on fees and overdrafts, et cetera. So is this a new normal? Or with the economic improvement do you expect to see also that stuff start -- mass of fees start to improve as well? Brian Moynihan : I think the biggest line item is the interchange-type dynamics in both debit and credit. And they're growing, but they are recovering from a deficit as I spoke about earlier. So that -- yes, that should help. And then the numbers of transaction accounts go up. But remember, we've had a strategy that is to lower clients' overcharges -- overdraft charges by our safe balance account, which were three million accounts round numbers. And we're trying to get customers to really use our services in a way that benefits them the most. And so that works against the overdraft line as the sheer dollar volume goes up. So we'll see. But what's really also driving us is just sheer numbers of growth in accounts will be the driver. It will grow slowly though because we have been constantly taking down. We have the lowest percentage of overdrafts as total fees in consumer of any of the large peers and we'll continue to drive that down, because that means the customer's in good shape. Ken Usdin : Got it. Okay. Last thing any quick update on the merchant and how that's progressing along as well? And now that that we've seen another kind of full quarter of that broken out? Brian Moynihan : Yes. I think it's still getting -- we put the new system and we're starting to sell it that we feel, okay. We feel it's a core part of our business. But one of the things that's held it back is that's a sales process, which is more integral to the types of people who use merchant services to be open more and that's obviously affected by COVID. So, its okay, but we need to improve it. Ken Usdin : All right. Got it. Thank you, Brian. Operator : Next question is from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global. Please go ahead. Jim Mitchell : Hey, good morning. Maybe just a little bit on consumer loan growth. It seems like you deliberately shrunk residential mortgage. Auto looked pretty good. But credit card was a little sluggish, I think, given typical seasonality. So, customers are flush with cash. How do we think about the demand for lending going forward? You gave some nice color on the commercial side on a monthly basis. How do we think about the consumer side? Brian Moynihan : Well, let me just -- the issue was if you think about being a large consumer lender and especially you watch the unsecured space when March, April, May hit you pulled in and even in the small business space. So, the good news is, is that we're reverting to norm. And so in December, for example, we had 198,000 booked accounts in credit card. That -- 191,000, that's the highest really going back to pre-COVID days, but we were running 300,000 back then. So we got some work to do to get it back to the full amount on the card side, for example. In terms of mortgage. Again, we are careful there, but also we're conservative on rates and we gone to look at that. So, we booked about $7 billion in the secured lending side including mortgage in the core consumer business. And so we feel better about that. Auto picked back up, but home equity is down to $0.5 billion a quarter or something like that when it was running $3 billion or something. So we've got some room to go. But the good news is the card is stable the balances are sort of stabilized. And at the 85 million you have some seasonality, but at least they stabilize there. And then the mortgage looks like we're picking back up a bit as we've made some adjustments and gone back to the more normalized underwriting, and auto has been strong. So we'll see it play out. But you're right, we had to pull back and have lost about half the credit card volume on a given month. And we're picked back up to -- from 150 million at the low point to 200 million, but we've got some work to do. Jim Mitchell : So, is the uptick in marketing spend sort of reflective of that push to reengage with consumer and we should expect some nice sort of improvement going forward? Brian Moynihan : All our marketing really is around consumer product capabilities. So, yes. Jim Mitchell : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Gerard Cassidy : Good morning Brian, good morning Paul. Brian just a follow-up on that consumer commentary you gave. And in your prepared remarks I think you said that you brought your underwriting -- you're bringing your underwriting standards back to the pre-COVID levels. Two questions I guess or two parts to it. Can you give us some color of how they changed? When you tightened them up now they're back to normal? Was it FICO scores on the consumer side? And was it also on the commercial side did you do the same thing? And some color on what's changed today there. Brian Moynihan :   Yes. So let me start with the commercial side. And this is about sort of the relationship side of commercial business, Business Banking, Global Commercial Banking, Global Corporate Investment Banking. Basically in March, April, we stopped prospecting frankly because it was sort of impossible to do plus you want to make sure you understood the portfolios. We've done quarterly portfolio reviews, every single loan going through to make sure the ratings are right make sure we understood with the customer to make sure we understood whether they're going to need covenant waivers. That over the course of the time here has sorted the group of customers which are in the industries that Paul talked about that are difficult. And the rest of the customers are solid in good shape. And frankly, their credit has been improving as we looked at it by quarter. And so about four months ago, we moved into prospecting with very narrow list of prospects for Business Bank and Global Commercial Banking think for middle market and upper end of small business across all our markets. But then recently we flipped and they can go back to full prospecting except for limited industries that you'd expect. On the small business side because of the nature of the business, it was a little more dramatic and we've opened back up. And we're getting -- we're up I think in the fourth quarter to give you a sense we were up 50% in terms of the originations quarter-over-quarter, but we're still -- we were up a lot more than that more than 50%. We're still down 50% year-over-year up 100-plus percent in quarter -- linked-quarter I think. And so new commitments up 135%; but year-over-year still down 47%. So that shows you that's coming through and we will see that happen in the small business side. So, that was probably the slowest because it's -- they are the most risk. And so that's the commercial side. When you go to the consumer side, the reality was we basically -- we stayed on LTVs on the commercial -- on the consumer mortgage side. We basically stopped with the FICO requirements we slowed down and do the market dynamics home equity slowed down. Auto, we went back out more quickly just because of the secured nature of and short-term nature of it. So, we felt good about that and probably we're always super prime and stayed there. But it's really what's changed in consumer in the last several -- last few months has been the move. And we're back to probably 80%, 90% of the ability to generate that we had. We were down probably 20% and we moved back up and so we'll see that flow through. But it was really just until you had some clarity where this thing was going you had to be careful for a while. So, that bodes well to economic activity and loan growth in the future. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. Thank you. And then Paul in your comments you were talking about having greater confidence with the deposits to go further out on the yield curve. You talked a little bit about that already. I guess the question is what changed on the confidence side that now you're comfortable to take those deposits and move them further out versus maybe six months ago? Paul Donofrio : Sure. So, what's changed is A, the level of deposits, right? We continue to get more and more deposits in. B, reviewing as Brian noted earlier where the deposits are coming from predominantly high-quality deposits checking, et cetera new accounts. Three, when you look at just the sheer growth of the money supply coupled with the expectation as we come out of this recession that the velocity of money will likely increase, it's hard to build a case that we're going to see a significant decline in deposits in the U.S. And we're going to get our fair share if not more of those deposits. So, because of how we run our business on both commercial and the retail side in terms of focusing on high-quality deposits, we just feel good about the deposits we have. Brian Moynihan : Yes and Gerard just to make it sort of straightforward. Once you got by the feeling this was an ephemeral move; and especially, on the corporate side that this was going to be what a state whether you could be a little more interested. On the consumer side, you always know those are going to hang, but the reality is the big inflow on the commercial side you had to make sure it wasn't a ephemeral. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And Brian and Paul, hopefully, we'll see you guys at Bank this year in person. Brian Moynihan : Good, we'll try, Paul Donofrio : Hope so. Gerard Cassidy : Okay. Thank you, gentlemen. Operator : Next question is from Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead. Brian Kleinhanzl : Thanks. I just have one question. It's regarding the reserve levels overall. I guess when you think about it I know there was some changes with this quarter driven I think by qualitative factors. But I guess when you look at relative to the base case, how much of the reserve is still related to qualitative factors? Meaning that if the base case comes true that could be released over time. Brian Moynihan : Yes, I don't -- I'm not sure we -- well, I'm not sure we give the exact methodology, but let me just give you a sense. If you take our reserve setting weighting in other words what we set the reserve by December for year end 2020, because we set it before the statistics, the unemployment rate was 7.8% and for year end 2021 it was 6.6%. And obviously the actual was 100 basis points-plus below that. So, you would expect as you have more confidence that the forward path is into a narrower range and the forward probability two things are going to happen as you go forward. One is the sheer dollar volumes of site activity has changed and so you're dealing with less in terms of charge-offs and things like that which gives you confidence of where the path is. But most importantly, as you think about real reserve setting and lifetime reserves is that the economic assumptions are clarifying and the end of the COVID era is clarified with the vaccine. And as we see that you'll see the uncertainty come down pretty quickly on the other side of that when that shows up in our assumptions. So we weighted downside nearly 50% of the elements. That weighting will come down over time. And so when that comes down over time, you'll see the reserves releases come away from that. The second thing is as the duration of the rest of the crisis comes in with more certainty i.e. more people vaccinated, you also see the lifetime calculation include the other side of the river to a bigger and bigger portion and so that will drive it. So both of those things will change it. And as Paul said earlier, if you look at our underlying economics team they have the economy crossing over where it was before and growing past in terms of sheer size at the end of this year and our reserve setting takes it into next year and things like that. So we are using a more conservative case which implies judgment. Brian Kleinhanzl : All right. Great. Thanks. Operator : We'll take today's last question from Charles Peabody with Portales. Please go ahead. Charles Peabody : The first deals with what's going on in the regulatory front. Recently, we just had two new potential appointees one to the SEC and one to the CFPB. Wondering what sort of issues you thought might emerge with these appointees. And more on the consumer side, because that's what I'm hearing where the biggest, which is going to be. Some of the things I'm hearing there's going to be a crackdown on payday lending overdraft fees, usurious rates, artificial intelligence used in redlining. Most of those probably affect you overdraft fees. But are there anything you can think of that might affect you? And specifically, what sort of things might affect the overdraft fees? Brian Moynihan : Well a decade-plus ago we started changing before the rules were changed our posture in overdraft fees realizing that a more stable customer base was vastly better for the franchise in the operating deficiency. And so we welcome an industry which has a great consumer-oriented path to it, because that's how we run our company. We've been doing it that way for a long time. So our fees on overdrafts have been declining really as a percentage of fees every year and probably in gross dollar amounts most years. And so we're not depending on those largely because of how we run the business being core customer checks 90%-plus the primary checking account in the household. And therefore they tend to overdraft less. And this year with the stimulus and stuff it's even lower. So we welcome -- we introduced this new loan product that basically gives a right to get an emergency loan for $5. And that is our response to allowing our customers who've been with us for a while to access their money for really no interest at all and use it in anticipation of paying us back quickly. These are things we've done to really help our retail customer segment, which is the mass market customer segment on manage their lives effectively. And so we don't have a business built on those kind of fee structures and that's we're not -- that's why we not -- we welcome any regulation that brings the market to us, because as the most efficient and the best brand and the best customer service the largest franchise that's fine with us. Charles Peabody : And then my follow-up question deals with -- I recognize the fourth quarter on a historical basis was very, very strong.  for all banks -- or big trading revenues didn't. And so my question is  a little more conservative in the fourth quarter. We already had the year something that's making it more difficult to the expectations? Lee McEntire : Hey, Charlie, you're really cutting out. This is Lee. You're really cutting out. I'm not sure we picked up. I think you were asking a question about FICC and something, but we couldn't hear you. Charles Peabody : Yes. Basically, the FICC trading results in the fourth quarter on a historical basis were very strong. But they did miss analyst estimates not just at BofA, but at JPMorgan, at Citi, at Goldman everybody. And what I'm trying to understand is there something in the environment that's changing, that's making it more difficult  too aggressive in their expectations? Brian Moynihan : That I don't develop those expectations. But our team had a good year and Jimmy and the team drove the business well. They do it consistent with how we run the franchise keeping the balance sheet -- one-third of the balance sheet in the $30-odd billion of capital we have in the Markets business. And for the year, we earned above -- well above our cost of capital and they did it -- think about the environments almost by month that were shaped. So we feel good about it. And so, I'll let Lee follow you offline to some of the broader questions, but we don't set other people's estimates, we only set our own. So let me -- I think that was the last caller, Lee? Lee McEntire : That's right, Brian. Brian Moynihan : Okay. Thanks. Let me finish here and let you get back to your day. 2020 let's close the book on that. It was a strong year by the team. As we think about what we faced : A wild operating environment with work-from-home, massive customer deferrals that diminished over the course of the year, massive borrowing that paid us back, deposit inflows, government programs to implement, changes in those government programs, multiple cases of those government programs and yet the team did a great job. So I thank the team for all the hard work they did. We finished the year stronger than -- the stronger quarter of the three during the crisis. We continue to see asset quality and -- mitigate now. And so we feel good. We're back in the market buying back stock today. We told you we'll buy $3 billion-plus this quarter. Our strong balance sheet capital ratios allow us to do that. And as we also said NII troughed in the third quarter and we continue to push up from here. And expenses year-over-year will be flattish, despite the fact we're investing heavily to have the best franchise. So thank you for your support. We look forward to talking to you next time. Thanks. Operator : And this will conclude today's program. Thanks for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Bank of America First Quarter Earnings Announcement. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, you will have the opportunity to ask questions during the question-and-answer session.  Please note, today\u2019s call is being recorded. And it\u2019s now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Lee McEntire. Please go ahead. Lee McEntire : Good morning. Thank you for joining the call to review our first quarter results. Hopefully, you've all had a chance to review our earnings release documents. As usual, they are available, including the earnings presentation that we'll be referring to during the call on the new and improved Investor Relations section of the bankofamerica.com website. I am going to first turn the call over to our CEO, Brian Moynihan, for some opening comments. And then I'll ask Paul Donofrio, our CFO, to cover the details of the quarter. Before I turn the call over to Brian and Paul, let me just remind you that we may make forward-looking statements and refer to non-GAAP financial measures during the call regarding various elements of the financial results. Our forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties, particularly during the pandemic period we've been operating in. Factors that may cause those to be different are detailed in our earnings materials and the SEC filings that are on our website. Information about the non-GAAP financial measures, including reconciliations to U.S. GAAP, can also be found in our earnings materials that are available on the website. So with that, I will turn it over to you, Brian. Take it away. Brian Moynihan : Thank you, Lee, and thank all of you for joining us. It's been a year since we first reported our results, which would include the health crisis impact. But what we see different now is we see an accelerating recovery versus the economic uncertainty that we would have faced the last year at this time. The most recent economic indicators reflected an economic recovery that has gained momentum and continues to be supported by fiscal monetary policies. From our company's perspective, we have emerged as an even stronger company and competitor than what we were when we entered the healthcare crisis. Compared to last year, Bank of America's balance sheet has higher capital ratios, higher reserves with lower charge-offs and record liquidity. Our diverse business model with leadership positions across all our businesses has helped us earn our way through the crisis. Our Global Markets and Global Wealth Management businesses, which would typically benefit from this healthy capital markets environment continued to perform well this quarter. Our Consumer and Global Banking businesses also performed well. But they were \u2013 thisis after being more negatively impacted for several quarters by the interest rate environment and credit costs. These businesses now are in full recovery mode and are out generating new assets and new relationship with our clients. Paul Donofrio : Thanks, Brian. Good morning, and hello, everyone. I'm starting on Slide 6 and 7 together. As I've done in the past few quarters now, the majority of my comparisons will be relative to the prior quarter to reflect how we are progressing through this health crisis rather than year-over-year. In Q1, we earned net income of $8.1 billion, or $0.86 per share, which compares to $5.5 billion, or $0.59 per share in Q4. The earnings improvement included strong revenue growth, which more than offset higher expense. Additionally, earnings also included a $2.7 billion reserve release, which resulted in a $1.9 billion provision benefit. Revenue growth was driven by strong sales and trading results, record investment banking fees, and record asset management fees, and our wealth management business, while consumer fees faced the seasonal challenge against elevated Q4 holiday spending. With respect to returns, return on tangible common equity was 17.1 and ROA was 113 basis points. Moving to the balance sheet on Slide 8. The balance sheet expanded $150 billion versus Q4 to $2.97 trillion in total assets. Deposit growth continued to drive the balance sheet higher. Deposits grew $89 billion in the quarter and are up $300 billion from Q1 2020. Note that as deposits continue to grow, loans declined $25 billion from Q4. We deployed some of this excess liquidity into debt securities, which increased $172 billion while cash balances declined $54 billion and reverse repo also fell. It is also worth noting that our liquidity portfolio is now more than one-third of our total balance sheet and has surpassed $1 trillion. On a period-end basis, our Global Markets balance sheet increased by $129 billion, coming off year-end seasonal lows and as customers increase their activity with us. Note that on an average basis, it is only up marginally from the prior year, and versus Q4, up only $40 billion. Shareholders' equity increased $1 billion. Earnings were mostly offset by $4.5 billion in net capital distributions and a decrease in OCI of $1.8 billion, driven by an increase in long bond rates. With respect to regulatory ratios, consistent with the fourth quarter, standardized remain our binding approach for us, and at 11.8%, our CET1 ratio is our binding metric. While the CET1 ratio declined 15 basis points from Q4, it is 230 basis points above our minimum requirement of 9.5%, which translates into a $35 billion capital allocation. The benefits to the ratio from an increased level of capital were more than offset by higher RWA from the liquidity deployed into mortgage-backed securities and growth in our global markets balance sheet. Our supplemental TLAC ratio at quarter-end was 7% and 6.1% on a pro forma basis, excluding the relief for deposits at the Fed and investments in treasuries. 6.1% versus the 5% minimum requirement leaves us plenty of room for growth in the balance sheet. Our TLAC ratio remained comfortably above our requirements. Let me spend a minute on loans and deposits before moving away from the balance sheet. I will focus on averages as that is what drives NII. With respect to loans, on Slide 9, you can see the downward trend across the year as customer liquidity and accommodating capital markets drove pay downs well above historic levels. I would draw your attention to the linked-quarter change, global banking, commercial loans declined $16 billion. But as Brian noted earlier, we are seeing pipelines build and balances have stabilized for more than a month, so we are hopeful for a turnaround. Loan payments by consumers continue to outpace originations with loans declining $14 billion in consumer banking led by mortgages. Plus, we saw normal seasonality in our card products as customers paid down holiday balances with stimulus contributing to the high payment rates. But what is also noteworthy is the linked-quarter improvement in GWIM and Global Markets. GWIM continued to benefit from security-based lending as well as custom lending. In Global Markets, we relax some hold limits as the economy continued to strengthen. With respect to deposits, on Slide 10, we continued to see tremendous growth across the client base, not only because of growth in the money supply, but also because we are adding new accounts and attracting liquidity from existing customers. Turning to Slide 11, and net interest income. On a GAAP non-FTE basis, NII in Q1 was $10.2 billion, $10.3 billion on an FTE basis. Net interest income declined $1.9 billion from Q1 2020, driven by the rate environment and lower loan balances, but was relatively flat to Q4. Compared to Q4, we see this as a good outcome considering the headwinds of two fewer days of interest, lower loan levels, and modestly higher premium amortization expense. These headwinds were mostly offset by the deployment of excess deposits into securities and a benefit of approximately $100 million from a legacy litigation settlement involving some securities. The net interest yield was relatively stable, declining 3 basis points from Q4 and it was flat if you exclude Global Markets. Reducing cash and repo, we deployed some of our excess liquidity into securities in Q1, split across treasuries and mortgage-backed securities. Securities increased $172 billion from year-end. On a weighted average basis relative to what we were earning on the cash, we improved our yield on that roughly $170 billion by approximately 115 basis points. Now, the improvement in yield could have been higher, however, but similar to Q4 purchases, we hedged a portion of the treasuries purchased with swaps, effectively keeping those securities floating. As you will note, given all the deposit growth and low rates, our asset sensitivity is rising. Our asset sensitivity to rising rates remained significant, highlighting the value of our deposit and customer relationships. The sensitivity is lower from the year-end levels as higher rates and deployment of liquidity into securities increased our baseline. So the sensitivity no longer assumes that liquidity is available to invest at higher rates. A few thoughts on NII for the remainder of the year. But first, please note that these forward-looking comments on NII assume that the forward interest rate curve materializes, that the economy continues to recover, and that we have some fairly modest loan growth in the back half of the year. Given those assumptions, we expect some improvement in premium amortization across the next few quarters if mortgage rates follow the forward curve. At $1.5 billion in Q1, write-off of premium continued to be a headwind as mortgage prepayments remained quite high. So forward-looking comments include a lot of material moving parts from rates, loan levels and premium amortization. But as Brian said, we believe 4Q 2021 NII could rise by as much as $1 billion from this quarter's level. Okay. Turning to Slide 12 and expenses. Q1 expenses were $15.5 billion, $1.6 billion higher than Q4. I will add to some of the remarks Brian mentioned earlier. First, Q1 included the normal seasonal elevation of payroll tax expense of about $350 million. Second, as a result of the current period's solid revenue performance and a better outlook for revenue for the remainder of the year, we accrued for higher incentives and experienced increased processing costs. This added roughly $500 million to the quarter. Third, we incurred some expense that differs from our typical operating expense. We reversed a decision made on some 2020 incentive comp awards, making certain portions of those awards retirement eligible. This accelerated approximately $300 million of expense into Q1 that would have been expensed over four years. We also recorded an impairment charge of $240 million for real estate realization. And we incurred $160 million of severance charge as we moved back toward business as usual with respect to our headcount. This is based on an expectation that as roles get eliminated through process improvement, some associates might choose severance over opportunities to work in a different role in the company. Lastly, our COVID costs remained largely unchanged as modest declines in some employee-related costs were offset by cost associated with restarting PPP originations and forgiveness and additional unemployment claims processing. COVID costs are proving a little slower to safely reduce than we had hoped. Turning to asset quality on Slide 13. Government stimulus and support has helped customers get through this pandemic. That support coupled with our customer assistance programs and years of underwriting discipline under responsible growth, has resulted in low net charge-offs. Net charge-off this quarter were $833 million, or 37 basis points of average loans, and were lower than Q4. And they were 14% lower than the fourth quarter of 2019, which was the last quarter before the pandemic despite an expected increase in card losses of $229 million in Q1. With the exception of a small uptick in small business and the card losses, losses in every other category declined from Q4. Provision was a $1.9 billion benefit in the quarter as an improvement in the macroeconomic outlook and lower loan balances resulted in a $2.7 billion release of credit reserves. Total consumer reserve releases were $1.4 billion, driven primarily by card, while the commercial release was $1.2 billion. Our allowance as a percent of loans and leases ended the quarter at 1.8%, which still remained well above the 1.27% where we began 2020 following our day-one adoption of CECL. With respect to reserve setting assumptions, we continued to include a multitude of scenarios. Based upon our Q1 weighting of those scenarios, GDP is forecasted to return to its 4Q 2019 level by the end of 2021. The weighted scenario also assumes that the unemployment rate at the end of 2021 will be just north of 6%, which is in line with March unemployment rate. For 2022, the weighted average scenario assumed unemployment just under 5.5% as we exit the year. To the extent the economic outlook and the remaining uncertainties continue to improve, we expect our reserve levels will move lower. On Slide 14, we showed the credit quality metrics for both our consumer and commercial portfolios. Overall, consumer net charge-offs rose $211 million from Q4, and absent the $229 million increase noted in card, other losses declined. With respect to card losses, given the reduction in late-stage delinquencies in the 180-day pipeline, we expect card losses to be lower in Q2. NPLs remained low despite a small uptick due to consumer real estate deferrals, which have limited expected loss content given healthy LTV ratios. Moving to commercial, net charge-offs declined $296 million from the fourth quarter as the portfolio stabilized with reservable criticized exposure and NPLs declining in the quarter. Overall, given the environment, the asset quality of our commercial book remains solid and 90% of the exposures are either investment grade or collateralized. Turning to the business segments and starting with consumer banking on Slide 15. Consumer banking produced another strong quarter in terms of customer deposits and investment flows, reflecting the strength of our brand, the innovation around digital, and deployment of specialists in our centers, all of which has enabled us to capture more than our fair share of the increase in customer liquidity. The segment earned $2.7 billion in Q1 versus $2.6 billion in Q4 as the provision benefit more than offset lower mostly seasonal revenue and higher expense. Revenue declined 2%, reflecting lower card income from Q4. Q4 has elevated holiday spending. Expenses moved higher as a result of real estate impairment costs, as well as seasonally higher payroll tax expense. This also caused an increase in our cost of deposits this quarter to 142 basis points. Absent the impairment charge, the cost of deposits would have been 131 basis points. As expected, net charge-offs rose from Q4 due to the flow-through of the bulge in card delinquencies as noted earlier. A $1.4 billion reserve release resulted in a $617 million provision benefit in the quarter. On Slide 16, you can see the significant increase in consumer deposits and investments. Average deposits of $924 billion are up 25% compared to Q1 2020 with nearly two-thirds of that growth in checking. Rate paid is down to 3 basis points as 56% of the deposits are low interest checking. Lastly, note the growth throughout the quarter as average deposits were up $39 billion from Q4. We covered loans earlier, so I would just note, investment balances of $324 billion are up 53% year-over-year as customers continue to recognize the value of our online offering. As Brian noted and as you can see on Slide 17, we continued to see improvement in digital enrollment this quarter. 70% of our consumer households use some part of our digital platform this year. We continued to see digital payments and Zelle taking hold across all our businesses. Zelle consumer dollar volume is up 72% year-over-year. Small businesses up 182% year-over-year, and 90% of our business-to-consumer payments in global banking are now made via Zelle. As you can see, our digital assistant, Erica, continues to add users' capabilities and usage. Plus, we are applying our success with Erica to other businesses as well. Okay. Turning to wealth management. We continued to deliver solid organic growth, durably comprehensive banking and investment needs of clients, and manage risk responsibly. We experienced strong household \u2013 new household acquisition in a virtual environment and a very competitive market. This resulted in a record quarter with respect to total client flows, including near-record AUM flows and record AUM fees. Net income of $881 million improved 6% from Q4 as revenue growth and improvement in provision exceeded an increase in expense. With respect to revenue, the record AUM fees were complemented by higher NII on the back of solid loan and deposit increases. Expenses increased driven by revenue-related costs and seasonally elevated payroll tax. Merrill Lynch and the Private Bank, both continued to grow clients as we remain a provider of choice for affluent clients. Client balances rose to a record $3.5 trillion, up $882 billion year-over-year, driven by higher market levels, as well as strong client flows. During Q1, our advisors added over 6,000 net new households in Merrill Lynch and nearly 700 net new relationships in the Private Bank. Let's skip to Slide 20, which is a new page that highlights our progress to digitally engage wealth management clients. In Merrill and the Private Bank, our clients and advisors have both embraced the value of a digitally enabled relationship in which digital tools are critical mechanisms for fast, safe and secure interactions. Our wealth clients are some of the most highly engaged clients in the franchise with 80% of Merrill households digitally active. In Q1, we saw a record number of log-ins. Clients are logging in to trade, check balances, and originate loans with ease all of which can be done through a simple side \u2013 sign in. We continue to enhance and modernize the capabilities for both the client and advisor, and these capabilities are becoming key differentiators, as well as being recognized by third parties. Moving to Global Banking on Slide 21. The business earned nearly $2.2 billion in Q1, improving $500 million from Q4, driven by a provision benefit and solid revenue. While loan growth has been challenging, deposit growth has been strong and investment banking revenue exceeded previous records. The team produced $2.2 billion in firmwide investment banking fees, growing year-over-year by 62% and 20% over Q4. Looking at revenue and comparing to Q4, despite the higher IB fees, total revenue declined 2%, driven by weather-related impairments on some tax-advantaged investments. Provision expense reflected a reserve release of $1.2 billion in Q1. Importantly, net charge-offs of $36 million fell by $278 million from Q4. Non-interest expense rose 14% from Q4, reflecting the incentive award changes noted earlier. Additionally, the strong IB performance and improved outlook and seasonally elevated payroll tax increased personnel costs in Q1. Looking at the balance sheet on Slide 22, average deposits moved up relative to Q4 as customers remained highly liquid. Year-over-year, deposits are up an impressive 27%, while repaid is at an historic low. As noted earlier, loans declined early in the quarter, but stabilized late in the quarter. Wholesale digital engagement continued to accelerate and usage continued to grow, driven by the same ease, safety, and convenience of our digital banking capabilities that our consumer customers enjoy. We present some wholesale digital highlights on Slide 23. Switching to global markets on Slide 24, results reflected the highest revenue quarter in over a decade with solid year-over-year improvement and an even more significant increase relative to Q4. As I usually do, I will talk about the segment results excluding DVA. This quarter, net DVA was negligible, but the year-ago quarter had a $300 million gain. Global markets produced $2.1 billion of earnings in Q1, more than double the level of Q4 and up 39% from Q1 2020. Focusing on year-over-year, revenue was up 26% on higher sales and trading and equity underwriting fees. The year-over-year expense increase was driven by volume-related expenses in both card and trading, and an acceleration in expense from changes in the incentive awards. Sales and trading contributed $5.1 billion to revenue, increasing 17% year-over-year, driven by a 22% improvement in fixed and a 10% increase in equities. These results reflected gains in commodities and strong results in credit, mortgage, and municipal products versus relative weakness in the year-ago period. This was partially offset by reduced activity and trading opportunities in other macro products. The strength in equities was driven by a strong trading performance in cash. The business has produced strong return delivering a 22% return on capital in Q1. Finally, on Slide 26, we show all other which reported profits of $257 million compared to Q1 2020. The improvement in net income was driven by a larger tax benefit given an expected increase in ESG activities this year. The year-ago quarter also included a modest reserve build. Our effective tax rate this quarter was 12% and excluding the tax credit, driven by our portfolio of ESG investments, our tax rate would have been 23%. For the full-year, absent any changes in the current tax laws or other unusual items, we expect an effective tax rate to be in the range of 10% to 12%. Okay. With that, let's go to Q&A. Operator :  Today, we'll go first to Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Glenn Schorr : Hi. Thanks very much. I wonder if we could just \u2013 you gave us a lot of detail in the expense side. I just wanted to try to get a jumping-off point on the second quarter. I think with all your comments, it gets you to the low- to mid-$14 billion range. I want to see if that's right. And then if you could give us the right perspective, meaning if you look \u2013 you all were able to keep the total expenses flat for many years while you grew the franchise. Now the economy is growing, capital markets were very strong, and the expense of dollars have crept up. But I don't believe they had an expense creep problem, but I wonder if you could address that and give us the right perspective to look at. Thanks. Paul Donofrio : Sure. So in terms of the second quarter, I think you're about right. We expect expenses just north of $14 billion dependent on the revenue environment and the amount of progress we make in taking down the COVID costs. In terms of your comment about our ability to manage expenses, we agree with you. I think as Brian noted in his opening comments, we've managed not to increase expenses for years now, and we've absorbed merit increases, investments, minimum wage, improvement in benefits, all the dramatic increase in processing volumes, digital increases. So we are sort of \u2013 as talked about in other calls, we've been using operational excellence and other initiatives to basically fund the investments in our future. I think our goal here is to clearly create operating leverage over an extended period of time. We've talked about maybe expenses rising maybe at a 1% level per year. And I think that's probably the best guidance we can give you. Absent again some of the ins and outs, we had a lot of variability this quarter. And obviously, we're sitting here in the middle of a pandemic with a lot of COVID expenses that have been a little bit more sticky than we had all hoped. But they're going to come out, there's no question about that. And so we'll get back to kind of a normal level of expenses and a very reasonable growth level over the long-term relative to revenue. Glenn Schorr : Thank you. That's exactly what I was looking for. Maybe just one other one. I think we see a lot of growth in the private credit markets and it started out strong in middle-market lending. It's transitioning and doing some now large corporate lending, the specialized lending, and aircraft and transportation now. So I'm curious given the breadth of your franchise, those \u2013 all those things I mentioned are kind of in your backyard. They don\u2019t \u2013 that's just a lending relationship, they don't have the same franchise you have. But curious if you see that the growth in private credit as a significant competitor in your traditional backyard. Brian Moynihan : I'd say, Glenn, those \u2013 depending on the asset, the type of loan, people have been in these markets for years, I think mortgage \u2013 I think, the other types of consumer credit, and then the commercial side. So sure that has an impact. But our job is to compete through it. But the reality of what's having an impact now, frankly, is that draw rates and lines of credit and stuff are low. And companies that are operating well \u2013 those companies that still need to get through the pandemic impact just aren't using their lines. And that's a bump along the bottom we've shown you as a long-term chart. So we feel good about our middle market and our business banking businesses, small businesses. We feel good about they're getting set up as the economy continues to improve and the growth will come back, and the services and rate we can provide are competitive. And so I don't think that'll ever change and I think it reaches further. Sometimes, it reaches the stuff we want to do as a company, obviously, in terms of leverage \u2013 extra amounts of leverage and things like that. But we feel we're very strong and competitive. And before the pandemic hit, we \u2013 middle-market will go mid-single digits and we'd expect to return back to that level. Glenn Schorr : That's great. Thanks, Brian. Operator : We'll take our next question from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Gerard Cassidy : Good morning, Brian. Brian Moynihan : Hey, Gerard. How are you? Gerard Cassidy : Good. Can you guys share with us \u2013 I think you touched on the capital cushion being about $35 billion and you announced a $25 billion share repurchase program today. Obviously, with the new stress capital buffer construct that goes into effect in the third quarter, you and your peers will be free to buy back your stock in the fashion in which you see fits best for you guys. Can you give us some color on how you're thinking about that $25 billion buyback, on how it will proceed after you get the okay? I'm assuming you got past CCAR, of course, in June, that gives you the green light to do the buyback? Brian Moynihan : Yes. Well, - so I'll start with a couple of things. One is the number goes up this quarter because the average of the four quarters is a \u2013 move forward a quarter and that's a higher average, so we'll be able to do more this quarter. And then assuming the new rules come into effect in July, we have substantial cushions and we'll look to bring that cushion down. We're not going to \u2013 we're going to maintain a cushion over the \u2013 our requirement is 9.5%. We'll maintain a cushion over that. You'd expect us to move fairly a pace to start to bring us closer to the cushion, that was honestly held up by the suspension last year this time of our ability to repurchase stock at all for the first \u2013 for the second quarter, third quarter, and fourth quarter of last year, which if you go back and think about our original CCAR filings, we were going to buy back a substantial amount. So we'll get back on \u2013 back in the saddle and drive it forward. And also because the earnings power of the company continue to work the dividend. And so expect us to get right after as soon as we can. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And Paul, you talked about the loan loss reserve levels. And when you compare them to your day-one CECL number from January of 2020, obviously, you're considerably higher than that number. Can you share with us the outlook for potential loan loss reserve releases? And could you just \u2013 and see an environment where you could approach the day-one reserve level, considering the economy when you look at your own forecast that you gave us today is much stronger than what it was on day-one in January 2020? Can you give some further color on that? Paul Donofrio : Sure. Just on reserves, absent a deterioration in an environment which we don't expect, we believe the reserves will continue to come down in the coming quarters as we remain \u2013 as the remaining uncertainties continue to diminish. In terms of the reserve versus sort of day-one CECL, every quarter we are reserving based upon the size and mix of our portfolio at that moment, and our view of the future is based upon independent sources. So as you think about that, you've got to recognize that our portfolio has changed. For example, card, which as you know has some of the highest reserve rate is down 25% from day-one. So you really need to think about how the mix has changed. You just can't go back to our reserve level on day-one which I think was 127 basis points if I'm not mistaken. And just apply that to today's numbers, I think you're going to do a little bit of a product mix there to get back. We've done that work and it shows we have still a significant, I'll call it, cushion to day-one. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Michael Mayo : Hi. I have two opposing views and I'm hoping that you can help me reconcile them as it relates to efficiency. On the one hand, it's like your slides are very positive. Global bank 74%, digital, connections, wealth, 80% of households, consumer. Digital, still growing and the unit cost per dollar of deposit, what, 130 basis points. So it's like best-in-class. So all that technology progress is noted. On the other hand, I look at Slide 12, and I see the efficiency ratio and I see the expenses, and I hear the higher guidance for expenses for this year. So I guess if you can help me reconcile these positive underlying trends with this number on the page of 68% efficiency ratio. And I do recognize that you're calling out a lot of expenses. The $1.6 billion increase quarter-over-quarter, is that \u2013 should we consider that kind of just one time? And where should this efficiency ratio go over time? Thanks. Brian Moynihan : So Mike, you pointed out that the operating posture of the businesses continues to improve. But as you go across page 12, you got to remember and you well know this that in the \u2013 the stuff on the left-hand side of the page you had a rate environment that it finally after years had come up to some level of fed funds rate and short of LIBOR rates and stuff. And that helped our efficiency ratio move under 60%. But even if you look at this quarter at 68% and you back out the type of expenses that you drop in the low-60s, and then the NII improvement will \u2013 because that frankly as you well know, comes with very little expense attached to it and i.e. that we don't need more branches and more infrastructure, or more \u2013 even more commercial bankers as those loans' usage goes up and the spreads just spread off of our floors due to our massive deposit base. So I think you should expect that even on a pro forma basis, you could see the low-60s. You should expect it to move back in the levels you see here as we move through the year, pick up the NII. And then if rates start to move up, you'd even pick up more. Michael Mayo : And you don't always disclose how much you're investing, but how is your investing spend? I mean, did you lighten up during the pandemic? Or are you picking up now or\u2026 Brian Moynihan : Not on the technology side. Michael Mayo : Overall pro forma basis. Brian Moynihan : Mike, on the technology side, we did \u2013 look, yes, I mean, technology initiatives last year were three and change, and this year would go up, frankly, a bit in those numbers we gave you because we continue to take advantage of that. And so I think 25 branches opened up in new cities this quarter, and we're seeing the success from that markets that we weren't in two or three, four, five years ago. We're now moving on the top 10, all organic, and driving off of that. And then salespeople. Now, that's what we probably lightened up last year just because the opportunities weren't there. But you're going to see us continue to reposition people from the efficiencies in the OpEx program to the front. And so headcount rose, really to support the exigencies of the circumstances. When you couldn't have your teammates anchored with each other, we had to have a few more of them move in the issues that were there for social distancing as working from home and overstaffing because of high-risk employees. So we ran up a little higher. And now you're starting to see it drift down. So that core number of headcount will drive our expenses. But the reality is we invested at the same rate last year in everything, except for incremental commercial bankers, probably, than we did in past years, and we're going to do it again this year because the payback is huge. Michael Mayo : And then last follow-up. Just on the COVID-related expenses, it seems like a little bit of a longer tail than maybe you had expected. When do you think some of those come off? I mean, you've treated your employees well with the special payments and all the other efforts that you've made. Is that like another quarter or two? Or are we toward the end of that? Brian Moynihan : Well, we're blending it. It's blending down because of the situation change. Obviously, as schools reopen and things like that, we can normalize the \u2013 we started last year this time and said, \"Teammates, when you work from home, we'll give you $100 a day to hire somebody to come in at your home and take care of your kids, so you can do a great job for our clients.\" That's why our client scores continue to rise during the pandemic. Obviously, as schools will reopen, we've tailored that program. We will normalize it at the end of the second quarter. That's one thing. Obviously, PPP, Mike, it got extended again. But as we're seeing the volumes be more modest this time, we can start to shape those teammates out. That forgiveness program will take us longer just because it's a tail, obviously, but we're through 200,000 done. And so you'll see that happen, and the extra cleaning and meals for the teammates and the testing and all the things we've done, that will come down as we sort of normalize operations over the next six months. But it took longer because things like PPP came out two more times since \u2013 or two or three times. I guess we're in four, would be the right number. So it's good. But we're doing what we need to do to support our customers, 0.5 billion \u2013 or 0.5 million, excuse me, loans originated under four different programs, so the constant change in rules. At the peak, we had 10,000 people working on it. Now, we've got about 3,000 there and 3,000 in forgiveness, and we can work it back down. So I think over the next six months, you'll see it start to blend down piece after piece after piece. Michael Mayo : All right. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from John McDonald with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead. John McDonald : Thanks. Sorry, on the expenses again, just on the COVID expenses that you were discussing, Brian, with Paul, remind us, what's the kind of size ballpark of that? I'm trying to think about the $56.5 million total expenses. And if we took off the 500 kind of special stuff you announced this quarter and then the COVID costs, which might be $1 billion a year, like is the \u2013 might you rebase at some point at 55 before business growth and things like that? I'm just trying to kind of put some numbers on it. Is that reasonable? Paul Donofrio : I would think of COVID expenses in the first quarter to be approximately $400 million of net COVID expenses. That was roughly flat, by the way, to last quarter. As Brian said, we ramped up for the new PPP and unemployment processing of claims. But we did offset some of that ramp-up with lower expenses associated with child care and supplemental pay and things like that. Brian Moynihan : Yes. So John, just to be simple-minded about it, the reason why we told you the full year is going to be higher is because we think it's $1 billion, $1.5 billion higher in the first quarter here that wasn't sort of, in our mind because of timing differences on some of the compensation matters and other things. So as you well know, we're pushing it back down as fast as possible. John McDonald : Yes. Okay. And then, Paul, I just wanted to follow-up, when you're talking about the interest rate disclosures, you mentioned that the model doesn't assume deployment \u2013 automatic deployment of liquidity anymore. Could you just explain that? Like what changed because of rate moves or deployment? Thank you. Paul Donofrio : The model doesn't assume automatic deployment of liquidity. I think we're talking about the 100 up and 25 down. John McDonald : Yes. Yes, exactly. Yes. Paul Donofrio : Yes. I mean, we got a little bit less asset-sensitive because we deployed some liquidity in the fourth quarter and in the first quarter. And so now, that's in the baseline. And when rates shock up, you obviously \u2013 you're not deploying that liquidity at a higher rate anymore. So it kind of moved from the sensitivity into the baseline. Do you see what I'm saying? John McDonald : Okay. Got it. And the last thing was just the NII ramp that could happen to get you $1 billion higher by the fourth quarter. How do you see that distributed? Is that kind of evenly? Or is it kind of based on the second-half loan growth coming back? Paul Donofrio : Yes. Look, we've been fairly careful about our guidance. There's a lot of moving pieces here. You've got amortization of premium that can move around. You've got loan growth, which is hard to predict. So we want to be careful about being too specific about how we get from here to there. I think we feel very good about getting to there. Again, the guidance that we gave you that NII in the fourth quarter could be $1 billion higher than what it was in the first quarter, that's based upon the forward curve materializing and some modest loan growth in the back half of the year. We've got some flexibility because we do have liquidity, can go faster or slower on in terms of investing. We'd like to put that in loan growth and not necessarily into securities, but we will invest it over time. We've got to see the amortization expense start to come down. It hasn't come down yet, even though mortgage rates have gone up. And like I said, we've got to see some loan growth, and we'll pick up at least two days here. So that's the best perspective I can give you. John McDonald : Okay. Fair enough. Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Matthew O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Matthew O'Connor: Good morning. I just want to follow-up on the deployment of liquidity that you've done. You did a lot this quarter or last quarter. If we look back since the end of 2019, most of your deposits have been deployed into securities. And most of the securities, I think, are longer-term mortgage-backed that aren't hedged. I know you said some of the treasuries were hedged, but that's a small portion of what you added. So I guess just conceptually, like is this signaling that you think rates have kind of gone up, kind of the big moves already happened for the next few years? Are you kind of thinking loan growth is not going to come back that much? Or what's the thought of locking in so many assets at these rates this quarter and the last couple of quarters? Paul Donofrio : Well, let me back up because I want to make sure that everybody's clear about kind of what we have done. You went all the way back to 2019 \u2013 if you go all the way back to year-end 2019, deposits are up $450 billion, and loans are down $80 billion. So we created $530 billion of liquidity to deploy somewhere, plus we're going to see some more deposit growth. So the $530 billion of liquidity, we had to deploy it somewhere. Through the end of Q1, securities are up $380 billion, and cash and equivalents are up $150 billion to $300 billion. But as I said in the remarks, we bought treasuries, but on about $150 billion of those treasuries, we have interest rate swaps. So you can really think of the $300 billion of cash as being $450 billion in terms of our ability to fund loan growth or invest for turn or other uses. So we've been balancing liquidity, capital, and earnings throughout this whole process. We don't tend to make bets on interest rates one way or another. We just want to make sure that we can deliver for our customers no matter what happens. And I think we've been trying to do that as we've gone through this pandemic. Again, it's all about balancing liquidity, capital, and earnings. Matthew O'Connor: Okay. And then just separately, in the prepared remarks, you guys mentioned about increasing hold limits a little bit. I think you're referring to the trading businesses. But if you could just circle back on that concept and give a little more detail on kind of where you were and where you are now in terms of the hold limits. Paul Donofrio : Yes, sure. I mean, look, we \u2013 in terms of \u2013 if you think about pre-pandemic underwriting criteria, we are, on the consumer side, I think, back to pre-pandemic now. In terms of the commercial side, there are still the affected industries that we're watching carefully, but everywhere else, I think we're back to pre-pandemic. And in light of the size of our company, in light of the need for loan growth, I think we're relaxed a little bit on some hold levels, particularly in global markets, where they have more of a moving than storage mentality around loans and what they do for customers. So yes, we're just taking a few maybe bigger positions than we might have otherwise taken pre-pandemic, but there's no real change in the underwriting standards. The company is bigger. We have more liquidity. We have more capital. So we think all of this is appropriate. Matthew O'Connor: And that's with respect to large corporate loans, not the trading book, just to clarify. Paul Donofrio : Yes, that's right. That's right. Matthew O'Connor: Okay. Brian Moynihan : Just across loan growth, just to think about it, what's going to drive the company's P&L also on the consumer side, especially, if you look at by business, so the wealth management business actually has grown a little bit. You got the commercial business down, and consumer is down. Consumer is largely down because of mortgage churn, but the big thing that happened is cards came down. And what's been interesting to watch now \u2013 and so because we pulled back \u2013 this time last year's unemployment went to 15%. Everybody pulled back their underlying criteria, Matt. We've now reinstated, as Paul said. So what's happened? We did one million units of new cards a quarter. Going into the last year's first quarter, it fell as low as 400. It's back up to 600 and change already and moving north on that. And if you look by month, it's stacking back up. So yes, so that's \u2013 and if you look at where that's coming from, obviously, the branch system, which basically was run at around 2,500 of the 4,300 branches for the last six, eight months, nine months, is only catching back up as it opens up and sales come in. So that bodes well on, obviously, on the consumer side, on the cards, which are most important. Mortgages production will continue to kick back up, and prepayments will slow down at a slightly higher rate environment. You'll see that bodes well there. GWIM has done a \u2013 has some of the mortgage aspects, but on the type of lending that GWIM does to affluent, wealthy people, they've done a good job, and they've actually seen that grow. And then you go to the business banking, middle market, and that's all line usage. And so that should come through \u2013 in order for the economy to expand 7% this year, which is what our Bank of America team has it at, at some point, companies have to access capital to meet that final demand, and you should see that usage come up. So even in things like the card business, because there just aren't the cards to sell, you're seeing line usage down at lower level. So as you think across the things \u2013 the hold levels and things that Paul is talking about enable us to push a little harder just because of the sheer size of our company. But if you think about it, think about the flywheel that we have in the company as a production engine, having had necessarily to be slowed down in the crisis with 15% unemployment peaks and the final demand being crushed in the second quarter of last year, then turning that crank back up and just watch that flywheel start to take off, that's what we have good confidence in terms of getting right back on loan growth. But if you added all that together and we grew 5%, it'd be $45 billion of loans. So to Paul's point, you still have tremendous excess capacity because the deposit growth is so strong on core transactional deposits with the commercial and consumers. Matthew O'Connor: Understood. That's helpful. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Betsy Graseck : Hi. Good morning. Brian Moynihan : Hi, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : Question, Brian, on just capital allocation. And you were one of the only GSIBs to really kind of trim down so that your GSIB number didn't go up recently. And I'm wondering if you're thinking about the opportunities there to lean into a higher GSIB, maybe do more in capital markets. I know traditionally, you've been looking to keep your RWAs in markets very tight. And I'm wondering if there's any thought to maybe leaning in at this stage given all the excess capital and liquidity that you have. Is that potentially an option that's on the table in addition to the buybacks you discussed earlier? Brian Moynihan : Yes. So Betsy \u2013 and the two are not mutually exclusive at all, except way \u2013 at the margin, way away from where we are now. But with stock price increases and all the things that go into that calculation, as you all know, they're not all related to straight risk in terms of sheer size and stock \u2013 just things that go in. It is harder to maintain where we were at the end of last year. And you might expect that we may move up a bucket and take advantage of that by actually expanding the business in the markets business, where the opportunity is there, based on the capabilities that Jimmy and the team and Tom and the team have put together. So why would you do that? The reason why we do that is our clients have been growing, and we kept about a third of the size. And even if you took away some of the growth just due to the deposit things, it has come down around 20% the size of the company. And the idea is to keep it in synergy and synchronize it with the company's overall size, but the company has grown around it another step. And so we've told Tom \u2013 Tom and the team are working on ideas to continue to do that. We stay \u2013 we're a little bigger now than we were at year-end, obviously, first-quarter activity, but you shouldn't expect us to come down. Now, those ratios aren't effective for a bit of time here, so we'll see how it plays out. But if the opportunities there will take them, the team has done a great job and managed the risk well. If you look at the trading results for the quarter, look at it for last quarter, look at it throughout the pandemic, they've done a great job in managing risk-reward balance. And we're proud of them and the work they've done, and we're going to support them with some more capital. Betsy Graseck : Okay. That's great. Thanks. And then separately, one of the most tedious discussions that I have with people is on comping your skillset in digital consumer apps and everything you're doing there not only for consumer but also for corporate and SMBs with FinTech players. And I say it's tedious because you have a huge market presence. Okay. But I don't feel like you're getting your message out there beyond this call. So have you given any thought to trying to get the message of what you've done for consumers in the digital and the FinTech that you actually are bringing to your clients beyond the four walls of your clients? Brian Moynihan : Well, that always starts with the \u2013 first thing that the reason why we do this is to serve our clients and do a great job and it flows through the numbers. As Mike said earlier, the idea that we run this huge consumer business at a cost advantage, which is significant due to the digitization of all the consumer activity due to the way customers interact this way we can help them the way and give guideposts. And frankly, that way we can take the fee structure out and that's \u2013 that we drop over our fees dramatically over the years and made up for it in terms of efficiency and other types of things. And so we get the word out, we tell everybody we win all kinds of awards, and the list goes on and on in terms of the different ranking agencies and they've seen, as the Merrill Edge growth, there's over 300 billion now. And so our job is to do a great job for our customers and I think, I'll leave to you and your colleagues to debate the relative merits of FinTech resources. But I will tell you \u2013 for a company making $8 billion and having 40 million new digital customers are fully active on the consumer side, half million on the digital on the \u2013 on the corporate side. The impact on our ability to have expenses be flat from even with extra money of $1.5 billion, so the first quarter from six years ago shows the impact of the ability to digitize as a company. And we learned more about this than last year in areas that we didn't do. So we'll keep pushing it out there. You can help us tell the story, but the reality is that the number one person we want to understand is our customers and that means attrition, you know, attrition in the customer is way down the penetration of their wallets way up. Just look at the wealth management statistics we threw in and see how that they've adapted to it. These are major changes, the size of which doesn't exist much out there. So we'll keep telling the way you keep telling a story. We'll keep telling the story but the key is it's producing, it's produced and they have kind earnings we're producing in the kind of efficiency we're producing, which continues to be down to our benefit going forward. The neatest thing about this stuff is where we go next with it \u2013 where we've been going with it. So Erica, there's just nothing close to it out there and driving it with volumes and things, so if you look at the charts on those pages and show it. And so it's the usage and the personalization and the ability to help people manage their payments and their things for the mass market and their investments. So we feel good about it we'll tell the story as often as we can, but the reality is I just \u2013 we'd like to see us keep growing a number of customers and drive in it and drive it on an integrated basis. We're putting major investments in a couple of areas. We had to improve merchant services, payments on the commercial side at the merchant level, and we've put major investments 401K technology to push that, with the number seven of that businesses is the lowest market position of any business we had, number six or seven of what we are. So these are major investments. We are making hundreds of millions of dollars a year that go into that expense base, better paid for by the efficiency of the core businesses. Betsy Graseck : Okay, thanks. Operator : And our next question is from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Steven Chubak : Hi, good morning. So I wanted to ask a follow-up on the NII outlook and really specific to premium amortization. Now, this given \u2013 the sheer amount of growth we've seen in the MBS portfolio, the deployment of all the excess liquidity. Paul, I was hoping you could help size what the premium and benefit would be if we did see prepayment speeds revert to more normal levels and how much of that benefit is contemplated in the billion-dollar increase in the exit rate for 2021. Paul Donofrio : Sure. Let me just give you a couple of perspectives. One, the premium amortization in the first quarter was about $1.5 billion. And as you point out, if the securities portfolio has grown, so as you try to size what it could come down to, you just can't go back to last year and look at what it was because the portfolio has gotten a lot bigger. That's sort of one. Two, and I think about that billion dollars, I would say the most important driver would be the modest loan growth and the second most important driver would be the reduction in premium amortization. So maybe that's enough guidance right there. Again, we're not going to go down to where it was in Q1. I really think, 4Q 2019, because we've grown so much. But it's going to be meaningful in terms of a few \u2013 more than a few $100 million in terms of that guidance we gave you. Steven Chubak : Okay, understood. And for my follow-up, just wanted to ask on capital. If I look at your SLR ratio, excluding the relief in your CET1 ratios, if I assume maybe like a 10.5% target on CET1, five in a quarter on SLR, the CET1 is still your binding constraint today. But just looking at the sheer amount of balance sheet growth you guys saw this past quarter, I think was about $150 billion or so, you know, our analysis suggests that you maybe haven't another $160 billion to $200 billion balance sheet growth headroom before the SLR becomes binding. And as we consider our expectations just for additional QE Fed balance sheet growth, how are you preparing for that potential \u2013 what sort of mitigating actions might you take if the SLR does in fact become binding? Paul Donofrio : It's just the way out there, Steven. I don't think your numbers are right. And I feel \u2013 well, I'd be glad to take you through some calculations but I think the numbers are a lot bigger than you think. Brian Moynihan : Yes. We've done that work and I \u2013 we came up with a bigger number in terms of balance sheet capacity. Paul Donofrio : On the SRL, it's 100 basis points times the much bigger base or the 75 basis points for example, maintained by the quarter. So it's multiple of that. It's multiple \u2013 it's bigger than what we've grown so far from by the lot. Steven Chubak : Yes, I guess, I think, what the difference is there is the lens of like what constraint becomes more binding in this SLR, I recognize you have access under both. But if the ratio is going to shake out sub-six pro forma, that relief gets at a 5% ratio, that's $500 billion of capacity to grow. But in terms of like where \u2013 where you have the most access, it looks like SLR becomes binding. In relatively short order, we're just maybe a couple more quarters of $150 billion-plus growth in the balance sheet. So I guess that's what I was trying to get at, that is, would you look to mitigate it, given it becomes a little bit more binding than your CET1 constraints? Brian Moynihan : We've managed the capital ratios to maintain the minimum requirement, that's not the issue, but I think it's just \u2013 it's hundreds of billions of dollars away. So\u2026 Steven Chubak : Yes. Paul Donofrio : We're 6.1 pro forma, right? So April 1, and that's $700 billion-ish of capacity down to the regulatory minimum. As you said, we'd want to have a buffer. But that's the rough math. Steven Chubak : Okay. Fair enough. I can take it offline with Lee later on, anyway. But that's very helpful in how you framed it so thanks very much for taking the question. Operator : And the next question is from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global Securities. Please go ahead. James Mitchell : Hey, good morning. Maybe first on just maybe the cadence for a card charge-offs. Obviously, we had a little bit of an increase this quarter but 30-plus day delinquencies are now back down to almost near lows. Should we expect, I think we hit charge-offs that we're in the 400s in the fourth quarter. Are we heading back toward that? Or how do we think, you have lower balances, how do we think about the trajectory of card charge-offs, given your view of the delinquency book delinquencies? Brian Moynihan : If you go to page 4, Jim, you can see it. I mean, you kind of summarized a bit. We went from 400 up to 600, it will turn back down just because \u2013 look at that chart. You can see that what produces next quarter's charge-offs is obviously on the right-hand side of this page and this come back \u2013 is coming down. So you have a balance that's lower, but also just half year delinquency. And as you think further out, it's going to come from the left-hand side of the page and migrate to the right from actual charge-offs. Leave aside the projected and provisioning under the sea. So you've got it right, it comes down and you would hope, frankly, that if you get the growth it might change this dynamic in six months or something like that just because it takes a lot of getting delinquency out anything, maybe much longer now. But this bodes well for the next couple of quarters. James Mitchell : Right. So I mean, the reason I ask is that if you look at charge-offs ratios only last year they were lower than pre-COVID levels so you still think we can sort of keep that very low level at least for now until balances maybe start to grow more significantly is that the takeaway? Brian Moynihan : But it did probably go down as balances grow because there'll be no delinquency then. You know, a year later when the delinquency from those balances whatever minor amount it is comes through it might add to that. So the denominator effect will push even down further on percentage as the balances go up near term, right? James Mitchell : Okay. And maybe a follow-up on the technology side. You guys did an acquisition, a small one, obviously, Axia in your merchant processing business. Can you just sort of give your thoughts on the opportunity set up as you build out that platform? Are there more acquisitions do you think involved? What's your excitement level, I guess, of building that platform out? Brian Moynihan : Look, it's a great little company that we can put across. The platform has a wonderful market position where it plays and we're very proud of the deal. But the key is that we \u2013 you got to go back to the whole history of merchant services. We sold half of it and a joint venture of 15 years ago now or whatever it was. Raise some capital, come forward, we bought it back. Remember, that's one of the reasons why our expense run rate moved up by $800 million to $900 million a year. People forget about us because we brought that in last year for half a year and it wasn't in two years ago. But the reason why bought it back is really to invest around that platform. So what is exciting about it is things like the acquisition to take us in the medical area. What's exciting about is the ability to actually sell it through this sales force without having to have a nano and sales force selling it in our small business and our business banking colleagues that thousands of people out there can and can help deliver the product and then what's really exciting is the integration of payment scheme that we've been working on for commercial payments. So it's an integration to the P2P which is held as a small business and all these payment gateways, which is outside the traditional merchant business but you have to be completely flexible along all payment schemes to actually rooted much more favorable to the merchant with very low cost to them. And in real-time contemporary value exchange. So what we're doing with real-time payments and Zelle and combination into the business platforms through the merger \u2013 through the payment gateways. These are all exciting things and you go larger and it's a different element and blockchain payments and everything else. So that's the core of the business on the commercial side but it goes all the way from small business all the way up to large companies and so that investment was part of that, the new investments were part of that and you expect us to keep driving at the implementation. The good news is we're getting the network effects of the Zelle and things like that. When you look at those pages that, Zelle's half the credit card charge volume used by our consumers to make payments now, the new line that for a minute think 35 million credit card people out there charge in the Zelle has reach and half of it checks down 25% of the last couple of years in terms of checks written by and by consumers. So you get the network effect of that and you get the merchants to use it in real-time. So this is all part of a thing that Thong Nguyen and Mark Monaco and team are leading and Faiz Ahmad on the commercial side that you should expect to see a lot. A lot of investments been made including a major replacement in the system that's coming to the P&L this year and the change in bringing the people fund fully on the balance sheet and a lot of investment will be made including acquisitions like we just made. James Mitchell : Okay. That's great color. Thanks, Brian. Operator : Our next question is from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Kenneth Usdin : Hey. Thanks. Just one question on just card and stimulus and how do you guys get the sense of how much of the stimulus and incremental deposit growth is sticking around versus now kind of starting to be spent? And what's the trade-off with regards to the staging around that releveraging or that balance growth that might start to come over time in the card business specifically? Thanks. Brian Moynihan : I think, just on \u2013 it depends, literally, when you look in customers\u2019 earnings power and things like that. But largely, I think, Paul and I last saw was a 30%-odd of the stimulus money has been spent to make it \u2013 to be a simple mind about it. And so the other 70% sitting in people's accounts are little different by stratification of the earnings power of the household. And so that has to be spent, that bodes well for an economic reopening and stuff. It has an effect on balances in cards and stuff, yes, because consumers have used to pay down their debt in part of what it has been spent \u2013 has been spent to pay down card balances. And then, with their limited travel we're just not getting as much use. But the good news is you watch January or February or March, with the virus and vaccine pathways come into for \u2013 was the \u2013 you're starting to see the purchase numbers go up. And the payments rate went way up as you've observed last year a 30%, to last year in this quarter. But you'd expect that that might be more constant and then users' rate will go up and start to drive some balanced growth which is good news. So the good news is the consumers are healthy from every aspect. We have no deferrals left except in the mortgage business. So all the debate we had about this last year this time through the system, delinquencies down, consumers sitting with their money in their accounts, and the economy opened up which bodes well and that's what you saw in the retail sales numbers today. And we expect that number those numbers to even be higher in the month of April because March was partly reopened in the month and the weather isn't too pleasant in the Northeast to even if you wanted to eat outside in the northern parts of the central country. Kenneth Usdin : Okay. Got it. And that's the offset \u2013 the offset is in Jim's question about that better credit could stick as an offset as well if there is still 70% sitting around. So we'll take that trade-off. Thank you. Brian Moynihan : Yes. And remember, where we play \u2013 where we lend money in the consumer space, we never came close to what the projected losses where we \u2013 we decide that the models projected that you knew by watching the consumer at delinquency and unemployment levels of our consumers. They're much lower in society and as that became clear that's what you're seeing coming through the reserve releases right now. Kenneth Usdin : Thanks, Brian. Brian Moynihan : Thank you. Operator : It would appear as we have no further questions, I will now return the floor to our presenters for closing remarks. Brian Moynihan : Well, thank all of you for joining us. Thank you and the company produced $0.86 of earnings per share, $1 billion return, and tangible common equity is 17%. We look forward to talking to you next quarter and we continue to \u2013 we'll continue to drive responsible growth while we're doing it. Thank you. Operator : We'll conclude today's program. Thanks for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day everyone and welcome to the Bank of America Second Quarter Earnings announcement. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, you will have the opportunity to ask questions during the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please note today's call is being recorded and it is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Lee McEntire. Please go ahead. Lee McEntire : Thank you, Catherine. Good morning. Thank you for joining the call to review our second quarter results. Hopefully you've had a chance to review our earnings release documents. As usual they're available, including the Earnings Presentation that we'll be referring to during the call on our Investor Relations section of the bankofamerica.com website. I'm gonna first turn the call over to our CEO, Brian Moynihan for some opening comments, and then Paul Donofrio, our CFO will cover the details of the quarter.  Before I turn the call over to Brian and Paul, let me just remind you, we may make some forward-looking statements and refer to non-GAAP financial measures during the call regarding various elements of the financial results. Forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and assumptions, and they're subject to risks and uncertainties.  Factors that may cause actual results to materially differ from expectations are detailed in our earnings materials, our SEC filings on our website. Information about the non-GAAP financial measures, including reconciliations to U.S. GAAP, can also be found in our earnings materials that are on our website. So with that, let me turn it over to you, Brian. It's all yours. Brian Moynihan : Good morning. And thank all of you for joining us, and thank you, Lee. Today, Bank of America reported $9.2 billion in after-tax net income, or $1.03 per diluted shares. These results included a few items worth highlighting, and I'm on page 2, ahead of Paul going through the details. First, as asset quality continued to improve and economy continued to recover, we released $2.2 billion of credit reserves established in the first half of last year.  The idea that a Company with our credit quality and other industry participants would be releasing reserves this quarter is not new news. But the reality is at BAC we're seeing credit quality levels that are very strong. Net charge-offs fell to 25 year-low as a percentage of loans, not just raw dollar amount. Let me mention a few items I don't believe were industry-wide expected at BAC. We recorded a $2 billion positive income tax adjustment following last month's enactment of an increase in U.K. corporate income tax rate to 25%.  This required a remeasurement of our deferred tax assets, which just reverses the write-downs from previous years when the tax rates were lower. In addition, our expense level included two things I would note. These add up to about $800 million. With our strong results and the tax benefit, we took the opportunity to pre-fund $500 million to our charitable foundation. This accelerates our planned funding for not only the rest of this year, but the next year as well. This is not new money, just utilizing some of the tax benefit to cover future expense. We also recorded roughly $300 million of expense associated with processing transactional card claims related to state unemployment benefits.  This represents, to a large degree, a catch-up as we move through claim by backlogs. Away from these [values, we] (ph) produced another quarter of solid earnings and showed evidence of good client activity in an economy that continue to recover from the pandemic. Now, as we all know, the healthcare crisis has shown improvement and economy has recovered. Progress on vaccinations along with the continued support of fiscal monetary policy has promoted a full and speedy recovery and return to economic health. We, like others, are reopening our facilities and we're seeing more products being sold by our teammates, in addition to the continued digital engagement at very high level.  Our advisors and bankers and relationship managers are once again, meeting with clients face-to-face, building even much stronger relationships. We're seeing customer demand continue to grow, given the opportunities our companies see. I'll take a minute or two on the economy. And if you go to Slide 3. We have included a few slides highlighting our customer data. Let me get a few highlights. The GDP growth estimates by our BofA Securities research team for the second quarter stand at 10%, and stand at 7% for the full-year 2021.  The re-opening is further driving projections of an economy that has continued to grow at a rate above the pre-pandemic periods into '23. Also, the unemployment rate dropped below 6% this quarter is projected by economists to continue to fall. You'll also note that stability increased consumer spending from our own BAC customers, which is not only much higher than the same periods in 2020, which you would expect, but is notably 22% higher than the first half of '21 compared to 2019. And you can see that [Indiscernible] page. That growth rate '19 was already growing strongly before the pandemic. A few comments regarding the characteristics of spending I think are interesting.  We're halfway through the year and the total payments through those -- through all the different means are $1.8 trillion; that's 60% of last year's level. Last year indeed was a record, even though it was suppressed in various periods when business were shut down. More specifically for the second quarter, the total BAC consumers [and small] (ph) business payments set a fourth quarterly consecutive record, reaching $976 billion up 41% year-over-year, and 23% over '19. The trend has also continued into early July.  Spending consolidated as COVID vaccinations increased, business reopened, and domestic travel increased. Combined spend of retailers and services comprises over 50% of debit and credit card spending a portion of the total spend. That increased 27% over 2019 second quarter, but did slow a bit towards the end of the quarter, as consumer moved their attention and started taking summer leisure trips and activity.  You can see that by noting a return of travel and entertainment spending, which comprised about 10% of debit credit card spend. You can see while recovering travel remains below 2019 spending levels. Putting the travel up a bit, as of mid-June, domestic airline purchases were up 8% over 2019, while international airline purchase on our cards are still down approximately 40%, showing the difference of the progress against the war on the virus in United States versus other places. Now let's go to Slide 4. We just put this chart in to show you that the consumers are paying their bills. We've shown this each quarter, so you could see that the actual card delinquency levels continue to edge down even as people are out and circulating the economy. Before we go to Paul, I want to comment specifically on 3 areas of interest to you; loan growth, NII, and expense. And we can do that on pages 5 and 6. First on loans. Paul and I are going to show you the average loans.  Paul will show you that later. End-of-period loans, I'll show you in a minute, and long-term trends, which are on page 5. What all these figures point to is accelerating growth during the quarter as we've spoken about on occasion. This quarter, we saw loan levels across most every business move past stabilization begin to make progress. Companies need to build inventory, hire workers to meet the growing customer demand. This virtuous circle of hiring workers and meeting customer spending will help drive the economy and hopefully, will result in more line usage on our loans.  You can see the path on Slide 5 of loans since the pandemic started in March 2020. As you can see, all of them are turning up in recent months. But moving to Slide 6, you see the more traditional detail for our Company. Let's start on the lower right-hand side of that slide. And talking about the commercial portfolio. Commercial loan balances after adjusting for the reductions of PPP loans for Quarter 2 forgiveness grew $15 billion.  This was led by global markets client borrowing activity, but beyond that, and still excluding the PPP loan forgiveness, middle market lending grew and our business banking team finally had growth in the month of June 2021, a first since last March. Fueling some of this improvement is calling effectiveness. Relationship managers have increased their calling efforts; we're now aggressively calling on targeted prospects. And with vaccination progress, face-to-face meetings have nearly doubled each month over the past 90 days.  Commercial loans wealth manager clients grew an impressive 5% in the quarter, as these customers borrow through our custom lending products. In small business, our Practice Solutions Group, which supports medical, dental and veterinary practices, has been building throughout the quarter, and small business production overall is back to pre-pandemic level. Turning to consumer loans, overall growth and end-of-period loans was $6 billion. Car loans grew with increased spending, even as customer payment percentages remained high.  Auto originations have grown fairly consistently, although recently, lower dealer supplies have affected that. Mortgage balance growth, which is a big part of our loan portfolio in consumer, has been a challenge in the low rate environment with high refinancing volumes exceeding originations in past quarters. We are only modestly down this quarter as our origination volumes are finally overcoming the payoffs. We are pleased with the trajectory through the period, and that feeds into the second half of the year. While average loans drive - that loan balances during the third quarter will drive the NII, it's good to start with a trend that has reversed the past quarter's decline.  On NII, the good news is that we correctly called a bottom three quarters ago. We told you that in the three -- that we thought the third quarter of 2020 would be the trough. Despite the volatility, and lower rate moves, and significant decline in loans, we've been able to hold NII at that level, or more, for three straight quarters. We expect it to move higher, and Paul's going to discuss that later. The other area I want to comment on is expense. We saw -- on a reported basis, we saw a $0.5 billion in expense reduction from first quarter of '21 to second quarter of '21. This quarter, we also had around 800 million in notable items for the aforementioned charitable contribution on employment claims process.  Absent those notable items expenses would have been down about a $1 billion in and low $14 billion range. This is the level we are targeting expense as we move through the rest of the year. In the second half of the year as we normalize our operations, we'll continue to return our business to usual, working on process improvements to allow us to reduce our headcount and to continue to fund franchise investments. Headcount in second quarter including -- excluding the summer interns, declined by roughly 2500 or over 1% from the first quarter. So the messages for this quarter are straightforward.  The organic growth machine that we had rolling before the pandemic hit is reemerging as the economy normalizes. We said be careful to ensure that the war on the virus stays [won] (ph), overseeing great returns. In retail preferred and small business, we saw a strong production of core transaction accounts above pre-pandemic level. This quarter was our best net sales growth in checking accounts since the second quarter 2015.  We saw card production about 90% overall pre-pandemic. But net cards of -- net of runoff were positive for the first time since the quarter -- first quarter of 2020 when we entered the pandemic. We saw growth in new Merrill Lynch investment accounts, and Paul will talk to you about that. We saw good mortgage production. We saw stronger digital activity. In wealth management, we saw household growth and strong flows continue to grow, even with use of our banking platform to grow its credit side. In global banking, we saw loan growth and new production coming on while line usage still remains very low.  We saw investment banking close this quarter with record pipelines. In markets, we saw a strong first half, even compared to 2020, and a strong second quarter, albeit with more normal seasonal impact. So normalizing more like '19, but still higher. And we saw headcount come down as operational excellence kicked in by over 2,000 people. We have work to do to keep driving down the core expenses in getting out the net COVID expenses over time. And above all, due to responsible growth, we saw a strong core credit metrics. So as the economy continues to recover, we're seeing organic growth engine kick back in. With that, I'll turn it over to Paul. Paul Donofrio : Thanks, Brian. Hello, everyone. I'm starting on Slide 7. As I have done in the past few quarters, the majority of my comments -- or excuse me, my comparisons will be relative to the prior quarter rather than year-over-year, given the pandemic. Since Brian already covered a lot of the income statements, I will just add a couple of comments on revenue and returns. Revenue was down 6% from Q1. The decline was driven by lower sales and trading results, that more than offset solid consumer and wealth management revenue, which was a result of higher card income and AUM fees.  It is also worth noting that while investment banking fees were down from a record Q1 level, they remained strong at more than 2 billion in Q2. Lastly, when comparing revenue against the prior year quarter, remember Q2 '20 included a $704 million gain on the sale of some mortgage loans. With respect to returns, our return on tangible common equity was 20% and ROA was 123 basis points, both benefiting from the positive tax adjustment and sizable reserve release. Moving to Slide 8. Balance sheet expanded 60 billion versus Q1, to a little more than 3 trillion in total assets.  The positive growth of 24 billion supported 16 billion of loan growth, while the combination of market-based funding and long-term debt issuance supported expansion of the balance sheet in global markets. Other notable movements in the balance sheet included a continued deployment of excess cash into securities. Securities increased 83 billion while cash declined 66 billion. Driven by the additional deposit growth, our liquidity portfolio remained above 1 trillion or 1/3rd of the balance sheet. Shareholders' equity increased $3 billion, as earnings outpaced capital distribution.  Capital distributions of $5.8 billion were limited to the average of earnings in the previous four quarters per regulatory guidelines, and were well below the $9 billion earned in the quarter. With respect to regulatory ratios, consistent with Q1 standardized remained the binding approach for us and was down a little less than 30 basis points from Q1. While the CET1 ratio declined 30 basis points in Q1, it remained 200 basis points above our minimum requirement of 9.5%, which translates into a $31 billion capital cushion. While book value rose 3 billion, regulatory capital was up 1 billion as the $2 billion tax adjustment did not benefit CET1 capital.  Higher RWA from the liquidity deployed securities, growth in our market's balance sheet, and higher GWIM loan activity, more than offset the benefit to the ratio from higher capital. Our supplementary leverage ratio at quarter-end was 5.9%, dropping from the prior quarter, primarily due to the removal of the regulatory relief. 5.9% versus a minimum requirement of 5% equates to approximately 600 billion of balance sheet capacity, which leaves us plenty of room for growth. Our TLAC ratio remained comfortably above our requirements.  Turning to Slide 9. Brian reviewed ending loan balances earlier, so I will focus on average balances, which are more closely linked to NII. As you look at the year-over-year trends, note that these numbers include PPP loans, which have been moving lower now for 2 quarters driven by forgiveness. You can see the change in those PPP levels on the slide. Focusing on the linked quarter change. While loans on an ending basis were up nicely on an average basis, even with a $3 billion decline in PPP balances, loans were flat.  Wealth management and global markets experienced the most notable improvements. GWIM continued to benefit from security-based lending as well as custom lending, while continuing to have solid mortgage performance. In global markets, we looked for opportunities to lend to clients against a number of different asset types, creating mostly investment-grade exposures as a good use of our liquidity. In consumer, we saw credit card loans stabilize for the first time in more than a year, as credit spending ramped up and new accounts continued to build across the quarters. Quarterly new account levels are nearly back to 2019 level.  With respect to deposits on Slide 10, we continued to see significant growth across the client base, not only because of the growth and the money supply, but also because we added new accounts and attracted increased liquidity from existing customers. I would just note that the link quarter growth on a spot basis included a headwind of about 34 billion from customer income tax outflows. Normally, we see deposits decline in the Second Quarter given tax payments but this year, we saw strong growth even with these tax payments.  Turning to Slide 11, and net interest income. On a GAAP non-FTE basis, NII for Q2 was 10.2 billion -- 10.3 billion on an FTE basis. Net interest income declined a little more than 600 million from Q2 '20 driven by the rate environment and lower loan balances, but showed modest improvement from Q1. The year-over-year comparisons beginning next quarter are expected to improve nicely, as Q3 '20 has proven to be the nadir for NII, and we are expecting NII improvement in Q3 and Q4. Compared to Q1, the benefit of an additional day of interest and liquidity deployed was offset by a lower level of PPP loan forgiveness, the absence of proceeds recorded in NII from the Q1 litigation settlement, and modestly higher premium amortization expense.  The net interest yield declined 7 basis points from Q1, driven by the continued addition of lower-yielding debt securities in Q1 and Q2, and a larger global market balance sheet. Remember, as part of our liquidity that remains, I would include about a $150 billion of debt security, hedged to floating, which earned a bit more than cash. As you will note, given all the deposit growth low rate, our asset sensitivity to rising rates remains significant and mostly unchanged from Q1, highlighting the value of our deposits and customer relationships.  Let me give you a couple of thoughts around NII for the back half of the year. Last quarter, when the forward interest rate environment was 30-40 basis points higher, we told you we were targeting NII roughly 1 billion higher in Q4 of this year. This quarter's loan growth is encouraging and supported with this target, and the slowdown in mortgage prepayments should also help improve NII. So while we still think getting NII $1 billion higher by 4Q is possible, admittedly the recent significant decline in long-end rates presents a challenge. This possibility, of course, assumes loans continue to grow in the Second-half and rates don't move lower from here. To improve our chances, we could decide to deploy additional liquidity at higher fixed rate in the coming weeks and months, as we evaluate the trade-offs between liquidity, capital, and earnings. Turning to Slide 12 in expenses. Q2 expenses were 15 billion, or 0.5 billion lower than Q1. While lower than Q1, the combination of the $500 million contribution to the foundation and the nearly 300 million increase in costs associated with unemployment claims, processing kept expenses above the low $14 billion target shared with you last quarter. Outside of these two items, expense was lower, driven by the absence of a few Q1 items : seasonal payroll taxes, the real estate impairment charge, and the acceleration expense due to incentive comp award changes.  Additionally, lower incentive comp and severance costs also contributed to the decline. Lastly, our corporate costs saw a modest decline as some pandemic related employee programs began to roll off. But this was mitigated to a certain degree by preparation costs for associates returning to the office. As we go to the segments, I will just note that the sizable foundation contribution was allocated to the lines of business, and therefore negatively impact comparisons to prior quarters.  As we look forward, we continue to invest at a high rate in people and in technology and in new financial centers. We are seeing the benefits of these investments, and now as we move forward, we expect that natural attrition will allow us to reduce headcount as we transition back to a more normal business environment. As Brian mentioned, excluding summer interns, our headcount this quarter, moved down by about 2500 people. Turning to Asset Quality on Slide 13.  Nothing but good news to report here. Net charge-off this quarter fell to 595 million or 27 basis points of average loans. This is the lowest loss rate in more than two decades. That is 28% lower than Q1 and more than 30% below the Second Quarter of 2019. Our credit card loss rate was 2.67, and several loan product categories were in recovery positions this quarter. Provision was 1.6 billion -- was a $1.6 billion net benefit driven by the continued improvement in the macroeconomic outlook, which resulted in the $2.2 billion release of credit reserves, split fairly evenly between consumer and commercial loans.  Our allowance as a percent of loans and leases ended the quarter at 1.55%, which is still well above the 1.27%, which was the level as we begun 2020, following our day 1 adoption of CECL. And as a reminder, the mix of our loans has also changed since CECL day 1. To the extent the economic outlook and remaining uncertainties continue to improve, we expect our reserve levels could move lower.  Okay. On Slide 14, we show the credit quality metrics for both the consumer and commercial portfolios. There are a couple of points I would make here with respect to card losses.  Given the continued low level of late-stage delinquencies in the 180-day pipeline, we would expect card losses to decline again in Q3. For at least the next couple of quarters, I would expect total net charge-offs to moderate around the current level, with lower card losses, partially offset by lower net recoveries and other products. With respect to commercials, metrics, reservable criticized exposure, and NPL, both declined in the quarter.  Turning to the business segments, and starting with consumer on Slide 15. Consumer Banking produced another good quarter with strong customer deposits and investment flows, and the return of card loan growth.  This reflects the strength of our brand, our digital innovations, and the deployment of specialist in our centers, all of which enabled us to capture more than our fair share of the increase in customer liquidity. As Brian said earlier, this was a quarter of reopening where both our high-tech and high-touch capabilities delivered growth in client activity. Given vaccination progress, we've re-opened certain financial centers. More of our associates were at their posts in our financial centers and customer traffic was up.  All of the above drove higher sales in our centers. At the same time, we also saw increased sales through digital channels, which suggest increases in digital engagement are here to stay. The segment earned 3 billion in Q2, 13% higher than Q1 as revenue, expense, and credit costs all showed improvement. Revenue improved 1%, reflecting higher card income on increased purchase volumes and modestly higher account service charges on ATM usage. Expenses moved lower versus Q1, given the absence of the Q1 real estate impairment costs and seasonal higher payroll tax expense.  We also saw some modest improvement in COVID costs, as some of the elevated pandemic related associated costs began to wind down. Our cost of deposits this quarter improved to an impressive 118 basis points. The team has done a great job servicing more and more deposits while maintaining a strong cost discipline aided by digital engagement. Looking back at Q2 '19, we have added 38% more deposits, while expenses have only increased a little more than 3% annually in support of all that new activity, even with COVID.  On Slide 16, you can see the significant increase in consumer deposits and investments. Average deposits of 979 billion are up 55 billion linked-quarter and nearly 170 billion from Q2 '20, with more than 60% of that growth in checking. Rate paid is down 2 basis points, as 56% of the deposits are low-interest checking. We covered loans earlier, but we'll just note that while average loans are down linked-quarter, period end loans are up modestly excluding PPP, as growth in-card balances and vehicle lending outpaced a small decline in mortgages. With respect to investment balances, we reached a new record of 346 billion growing 40% year-over-year as customers continue to recognize the value of our online offering.  On Slide 17 I'll highlight a couple of points regarding the continued improvement in engagement. After crossing 40 million digital users in Q1, we added another quarter million users in Q2. This quarter 70% of our consumer households used some part of our digital platform. We also reached 2.6 billion log-ins from customers in the last 90 days. And while you will note the tremendous Erica and Zelle usage, what I would draw your attention to is the digital sales growth, which is up 26% year-over-year. 85% of booked mortgages in the quarter were done digitally, while 77% of direct vehicle loans were digital.  Turning to Wealth Management. The continued economic reopening and strong market conditions led to records in average deposits, loans, investment balances, and asset management fees in Q2. Both Merrill and the Private Bank contributed to this improvement. Growth in gross new households at Merrill continued and the average size of the new households is larger this year than last year. And at the same time, net new households grew, but at a slower pace given expensive competitive hiring practice across the industry. We remain committed to organic growth in our advisors and private client sales force, as a stronger, more sustainable, long term strategy.  Net income of nearly 1 billion improved 12% from Q1, as we saw improvement in both revenue and expense. With respect to revenue, the record AUM fees complemented higher NII on the back of solid loan and deposit increases. Expenses dropped as the absence of seasonally elevated payroll tax in Q1 was partially offset by higher revenue-related costs. Client balances rose to a record of $3.7 trillion up $725 billion year-over-year, driven by higher market levels, as well as strong client flows.  Let's skip to Slide 20, which highlights our progress to digitally engage wealth management clients. In both Merrill Lynch and the Private Bank, we are focused on 3 pillars for digital engagement : 1, digital adoption and deeper engagement, 2, modernizing our platform for advisors and clients, and 3, secure an easy collaboration with clients. We've provided stats on Slide 20 that show record levels of digital engagements improved further in Q2. These are some of the highest levels of digital activity across our customers. More and more clients are logging in to easily trade, check balances, and originate loans, all through one simplified sign-off. 70% of checks deposited by the Private Bank clients and more than half of checks from Merrill clients are being deposited digitally now.  And through leveraging Erica-based AI capabilities and through use of WebEx meetings and secure text messaging, we are making it easy and more efficient for clients to do business with us wherever and however they choose. This creates additional capacity for our advisors to spend more time with existing and potential clients. Moving to Global Banking on Slide 21. The business earned $2.4 billion in Q2, improving $251 million for Q1. Strong revenue growth and lower expenses were mitigated by a lower provision benefits in Q1.  Deposit growth maintained or remained strong and increased $20 billion to a new record. Outside of PPP loan forgiveness, we saw modest growth across the platform as discussed earlier. Revenue growth reflected the absence of the prior quarter impairment on some energy investments, as well as increased ESG investments. Revenue also included strong firm-wide IB fees of 2.1 billion, down only modestly from the record Q1 level. This performance resulted in an improvement to a Number 3 ranking in overall fees with a pipeline that remains strong. Strong debt issuance was more than offset by lower equity underwriting fees. We had a provision benefit driven by a reserve release of 834 million in Q2, which was $328 million lower than the Q1 release.  Net charge-offs were near zero, reflecting both low charge-offs and a notable recovery in the quarter. Noninterest expense declined 7% from Q1, reflecting lower compensation partially offset by other costs. We've already covered much of the balance sheet on Slide 22, so let's skip to Digital Trends on Slide 23. We continued our investments in digital solutions that deliver efficiencies for both clients and our employees. The solutions for clients have a compounded effect since they invariably need less manual intervention by the bank, enhancing both efficiency and satisfaction.  Enhanced banking solutions are helping us capture greater market share, as wholesale clients do more with their banking partners -- do more with banking partners that are stable and secure, and that have the capability to invest in new technologies that will provide better data and global integrated solutions. Digitization, and in particular, artificial intelligence, is helping us streamline processes and respond to clients more quickly and efficiently.  As an example, our bankers are using technology powered by Erica to not only better manage credit exposure, but also identify and win new business. We present some wholesale digital highlights on Slide 23. Switching to Global Markets on Slide 24, results reflect solid but lower sales and trading activity as noted earlier. While down from the more elevated pandemic periods, trading revenue is still 10% or so higher from Q2 '19. As I usually do, I will talk about results excluding DVA.  This quarter net DVA was negligible, but the year-ago quarter had a $261 million loss. Global Markets produced 934 million of earnings in Q2, down more than 1.1 billion compared to either Q1 for the year-ago quarter. Focusing on the year-over-year, revenue was down 15%, driven by the reduction in sales and trading. The year-over-year expense increase was driven by higher costs associated with processing unemployment claims and the activity-related sales and trading costs. Compared to Q1 expense, the higher unemployment processing costs were mostly offset by lower compensation. Sales and trading contributed $3.6 billion to revenue, declining 19% year-over-year.  FICC declined 38% while equities improved 33%, recording one of the strongest equity performances in our history. FICC results reflected a much more robust trading environment in the year-ago period, particularly for macro products. Q2 '21 saw credits tightened and agency mortgages endured a difficult trading environment given the volatility breaks. The strength in equities was driven by a strong trading performance in derivatives and increased client activity, notably in derivatives and in Asia.  On Slide 25, we note half-year revenue trends across the last few years. As you can see, while the pandemic elevated results in 2020, 2021 remained well above the prior years presented, driven by continued client activity and volatility in the market. Finally on Slide 26, we show All Other, which reported profit of 1.9 billion. The $2 billion tax adjustment benefit of results. Absent this benefit, we would've reported a $137 million loss, which is a decline of 239 from Q1 '21 driven by lower revenue. Revenue declined $545 million, reflecting two impacts. First, higher partnership losses on ESG -- on increased ESG investments. As you know, we record grossed up revenue from these investments on an FTE basis in Global Banking, pay the full tax there, and then back out those entries in all other. You can also see the increase in ESG investments in Q2 in other income on our consolidated income statement where partnership losses are booked. While this loss impacts revenue, it is more than made up for on the tax line. We expect our tax credit and associated losses in consolidated other income to increase by at least 100 million in Q3.  And keep in mind, Q4 is normally even higher, reflecting seasonal activity. Revenue in all other was also impacted by some refinancing activity, recalled and refinanced higher-cost structured notes, which puts some AOCI back through the income statement. Our effective tax rate this quarter, excluding the $2 billion tax adjustments, was 10.7%. And further excluding tax credits driven by our portfolio of ESG investments, our tax rate would have been 25%. For the second half of '21, absent any changes in current tax laws or any other unusual items, we expect our effective tax rate to be in the range of 10% to12%. Okay. With that, we're ready to go to Q&A. Operator : We'll take our first question from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Glenn Schorr : Hi, thanks very much. Wondered if we could contextualize your loan growth inflection conversation. I heard you on cards and auto contributing to the modest pickup on period-end loans. So I'm wondering what confidence level you have of that continue in the second half will be card auto or will middle market, M&A, or anything else start contributing and then maybe most importantly, do you think 2022 could be a normal-ish loan growth year, say low to mid single-digits, like you had been running. Thanks. Brian Moynihan : Hi, Glenn. I think if you look across all the businesses, on an end of period basis, have loan growth, which bodes well. The usage online is still low. And so that is still running in the low 30s, which is about a 1,000 basis points on average lower in the banking segment. But what you see underneath that is that even business banking, which is the segment from 5 million to50 million, is net growing finally, and it was the most affected by the PPP runoff. And the runoff in PPP in the quarter was about $6 billion, $7 billion or something like that. We impulse basically flat average balances, that included. We overcame that.  So we feel good as you look across the things. So what you really see is your net card production back to pre-pandemic, you see gross card production basically about 90% of pre-pandemic. You see autos, which will pick back up as inventories become available. And the real driver on the consumer side is mortgages. We've basically been holding our own right now. And that was different than, frankly, on the refi side, we lost some balances through the last several quarters. And on the commercial side, it's really line usage, honestly can't go any lower. Maybe can, but theoretically you can't because it's been stuck here for a good four or five quarters with the activity.  But the auto dealer line usage, which is net side the house, for example, is very low than it traditionally is. So we expect those to pick back up, but the key is we're actually producing more customers and more clients even at a low usage and the loans are starting to grow. Glenn Schorr : Sounds like we got a shot. Thanks. Brian Moynihan : Yup. Glenn Schorr : Maybe a very similar question on expenses and then I'll be done. You noted that there's some COVID expenses still in there. But excluding the two one-time as you've called out, we're still in the low 14s. It sounds like low 57 billion range for the year is okay. Should -- we've been asking this question every year, any one of us have. Should '22 to be materially different than '21, given how you're able to fund a lot of the investments internally? Paul Donofrio : So Glenn, this is Paul. We're not providing specific '22 expense outlook, but I will offer the following thoughts which I think answer your question. So our rough estimate for the fourth quarter expense is a range of low $14 billion. I think if you add to that the seasonal higher payroll tax, approximately $350 million in Q1, plus add in 1% inflationary costs that we've talked about now for many quarters. Remember, if we do nothing, cost would grow by 3% or 4%, but we're driving that lower every year and quarter through OpEx, [SIM] (ph) and other initiatives.  But if you take the 4Q expense, you have the higher seasonal payroll tax, at 1%, that's a good base, I think. And then from there, adjust based upon whatever assumption you want to make around higher revenue expectations in areas that are closely linked to compensation exchange fees. I think if you do that math, you'll have a pretty good number. Glenn Schorr : Thank you Paul, appreciate it. Operator : We'll take our next question from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Matthew O'Connor: Good morning. I know in recent quarters I've been asking about just a thought process on how you deploy liquidity in securities, and look, it's been the right call because you were buying what felt like low rates. But rates have gone down again. But I just want to circle back on, what is the thought process you had alluded to, potentially deploying more liquidity in the coming weeks.  And I guess just step back and it seems like your loans are starting to grow, deposit growth starting to flow. And again, you know, rates have ticked down again. So why lock in, kind of 10-year duration at these levels, with that as a backdrop? Brian Moynihan : Matt, I'll let Paul hit it more specifically. But one of the things that we just have to always keep minding, and you've touched on, is that deposits have crossed $1.9 trillion and the loans are 900 and change. And that difference has got to be put to work. And the route is we generate $80 billion deposit growth. And we got to put it to work, and that's what we do.  And so we're not timing the a market of betting or in a way, we just sort of deploy when we're sure it's really going to be there. And so -- and that's been our strategy. And yes, we put them to work and it turned out to be, in the aftermath, a good thing. And I think frankly, I'd rather have a higher rate structure if that is a long-term earning for the Company, but I'll let Paul talk about redeploying. Paul Donofrio : Yeah. I don't know what specifics you're looking for, but I would echo some of Brian's comments. I think we've been very balanced. We -- if you look at the results compared to other banks, we've maintained our NII for the last few quarters here.  We called the bottom in the third quarter. But at the same time we were doing that, we still are reserving significant liquidity. We have a lot of dry powder as we sit here today, and more deposits are coming. Matthew O'Connor: Should we just think about it loans plus securities will basically equal deposits? So if the loan growth is modest, you keep growing deposits, [Indiscernible] in the security is regardless of rates? Brian Moynihan : Yes. They got to take out. We do have to keep straight cash, obviously, that we showed you. But that's generally the way to think about it. And the debate is, do you remember, we hedged a lot of the stuff that we bought just to protect ourselves a little bit.  But that's the simple way to think about it. In the bank side balance sheet that's a simple way to about, but obviously the securities firms different. Paul Donofrio : I'll Just reiterate. Like you said, we're going to get deposits. It's going to fund loan growth. Whatever's left over will probably go in securities, but then we still have a bunch of excess liquidity. So that can be deployed as well, either in the near-term or long-term, depending on how we balance liquidity against capital and earnings. Brian Moynihan : Actually going back to Glenn's question, Matt. One thing is we can't take advantage of is, our extreme efficiency in the consumer business with the rate structure. And so I think they got down and are \u2013 they are pushing towards a 100 -- 120 basis points of deposits because of the growing core-checking customers at a more rapid pace than we've grown in a while.  So consistently quarter-after-quarter-after-quarter, that's going to stick to our rifts if you don't pay anything for it. And as rates rise, it will drive the efficiency. But we just haven't had a chance to take advantage of it, frankly because of the rate spike. Matthew O'Connor: Okay, got it. That's helpful. Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Michael Mayo : Hi. I'm stuck on slide 17 with the digital usage. So I guess you have a record number of digital users, 70%, you highlighted digital sales of 26% year-over-year. Where aspirationally do you want that to go and what can be the impact on headcount and expenses?  And it's the same question I asked before, you have best -in-class digital cost of deposits and the consumer is the lowest in the industry, but doesn't translate to the overall firm. So I'm just trying to connect the dots from your great digital usage to better efficiency and also get some sense of your aspirations on the digital side. Brian Moynihan : So Mike, to answer this last question. It's sort of that question, which is the consumer side doesn't get the advantage until you get the summary structure on the short end, especially. And so all that investment though, it'd be like we're having the same conversation we had in '16, before rates rose and when's this going to pay off and then it exploded and paid off. And we expect that to happen again as the economy normalizes. And we are taking good advantage of that as you well know, prior to the pandemic. And so, let me back up on digital products and usage. The key strategies we've been engaged on is beyond a consumer and Paul hit some of the wealth management pieces, you can see them. And so when we're talking about the digital things, we're actually showing it by each segment; for the growth and the wealth management cycle for external usage i.e. customers and internal, is extremely important in using Erica internally as a method of artificial intelligence-based natural language processing that helps to make people more efficient in the commercial segment wealth management.  So we don't have -- our aspiration is just to follow and push the clients at the same time. And that always has a benefit, and that's why over the last decade, we're down 40,000 people in the retail network, to give you a sense and -- of where it goes. We have some internal plans, we have an idea, but we are -- we don't go out and say that because frankly, it happens piece by piece by piece. And honestly at $2500 -- 2500 FTE reduction in the quarter, is in part due to the consumer efficiencies kicking back in once they got through PPP process and things like that. Paul Donofrio : And that reduction of headcount you ought to also factor in the increase in headcount at the front office. So we're getting a reduction overall. If you go back pre-pandemic or if you look at this quarter, but at the same time you're seeing a mix shift. We're adding more people out there talking to customers across the platform and we have less people in support in the back-office. Michael Mayo : Okay. Just one follow-up on that aspirational question. When you stripped out and you don't normalize everything, rates and everything else you want to do, how much more do you think you can lower unit cost over the next several years, and what would be the main technology driver for that? Brian Moynihan : Ther are basically 3 ways. One, that it's all going to show up in headcount, and so we expect that the consumer cost of deposit is gone from 350 basis points probably 10, 12 years ago, to 120. And so we'd expect to keep driving that down, and that's going to be driven by everything we just talked about.  When you get to revenue-related compensation of wealth management business, that's up $0.5 billion from this quarter '19 probably or something like that. And that's a good thing because we make money, but that will be more driven by its production capabilities and things like that. There's basically buildings and how many do you need and how many people -- that's driven by how many people and how much you pay our teammates, who are talented and drive the business. That's driven by how many people, and we just had a -- we had been working our way down in headcount and it then froze because of all the work we had to do around the pandemic-related programs. But now, it's dropped by 1% in the quarter, and that's where -- that's where it pays back. Michael Mayo : Great. Alright. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open Brian Moynihan : Good morning, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good morning. Great slide on Slide 5. Really love it. Thanks for all the detail. I just wanted to dig in on card a little bit. There has been some discussion around how spend is up a lot, as you indicated as well. And how much of that spend is likely to be translating into revolving versus transactor.  You're giving us the daily, clearly, we can see that here on the slide, but it would be helpful to understand what you're seeing in the guts of the machine. And has it revolved or started to pick up, or does this loan growth that you've show on the slide reflect just the increased spend in transactor paydown rates are similar to what they've been over the past few months? Brian Moynihan : So the revolver piece is starting to move forward, but it is down obviously significant pre-pandemic. The transactor piece is higher. Well you want people to use the card to get revenue and you saw that in the fee line to get revenue from the usage and also get revenue from the loans. The loans are obviously the better part of the equation, but Betsy you have to realize, we have about round numbers, same number of cards outstanding.  There's $25 billion less balances, which people didn't get any different. They just have more cash. And so they paid off the credit cards, which is a completely responsible thing for them to do. And when they can get out and spend more money, which is starting to happen, I think you'll see them use these [Indiscernible] short-term purchase.  So I don't think -- yeah, the pay rate is up, but I don't think it's a fundamental difference of behavior, it's just the opportunity to use the cards or activity has been limited coming into this quarter when we finally saw things open. We'll see where it goes, but it's -- the good news is it's going a different direction, and had been leading up an entry point about Slide 5. And the good news is the people are high credit quality, so that means that the nettage fee risk-adjusted margin, i.e, that margin from cards minus the charge-offs, is actually closer than what people think because the card charge-offs are dropped by 300 million to 400 million a quarter. Betsy Graseck : Okay, Brian. That's -- yeah. No, that's great. That leads into the followup, which is relating to your reserve ratio on card. I think the way we're calculating is around 8.5% or 8.8% at this stage. Give us a sense as to how you're thinking about that trajectory here, given that the environment has been improving, what should we expect on reserves going forward? Brian Moynihan : Go ahead, Paul. Paul Donofrio : I'll answer the question this way. If you go to CECL day 1, I think it was 6 point something, right? 6.98. So that gives you a sense of a different environment with a different sort of economic outlook at that moment. Obviously, as we grow loans, card loans, which we're talking about doing, it's gonna eat into some of that excess reserve.  But I think between whatever you wanna model on loan growth and whatever you wanna think about in terms of getting back to CECL day 1, you could kinda come up with whatever -- with an answer. Betsy Graseck : Right. And could you even be below CECL Day 1 because the environment is so good right now? Paul Donofrio : You could easily be below CECL Day 1. I mean, as you know, it just depends at the moment you are setting your reserve, what your mix is, what are your card balances and what is your view of the future. And our view of the future is a more benign environment than it was in CECL Day 1, then by definition, you'd end up with lower reserves. Brian Moynihan : And that's the point of page 6, Betsy, really goes to your question on card specifically. Betsy Graseck : Okay. Thanks very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Steven Chubak : Hi. Good morning. Paul Donofrio : Morning, Steven. Steven Chubak : So Paul, it was certainly encouraging to hear that there's still a path to the $1 billion improvement in that NII exit rate that you cited, just giving some of the long-end pressures since you gave that guidance. I was hoping you could just help us unpack some of the component pieces, given it's a meaningful step-up versus what we saw in the most recent quarter.  And maybe just thinking about it in 3 buckets : loan growth, liquidity deployment, and premium [ML] (ph) being the third. Assuming no change in the forward, like, how can we underwrite that path to the $1 billion increase off the current base? Paul Donofrio : So I would say that it's -- it's about half loan growth. Well, first back out, we have an extra day. Okay. Back that out, and as we sit here today, it will be roughly half loan growth and half premium [ML] (ph) reduction. Having said that, it's a challenge given that the fact the rates have fallen, it's a challenge. It's hard to get there. And so we've always had the opportunity to deploy a little more liquidity as we think about this going forward. Steven Chubak : Understood. At least the premium amount ultimately will come. It's just a question of timing there, so. But I understand that that could at least impact where it shakes out by the end of the year. The other thing I wanted to get a better sense of, Paul, is just on the capital comments that you made earlier.  You noted that you're at 11.5%, 200 bps above your minimum. Just curious if you can give us some sense as to where you plan on operating on a steady-state basis, how much cushion you want to retain. And just given the strength of your excess capital position, how should we be thinking about the pace or cadence of the buyback for the next 4 quarters? Brian Moynihan : Obviously, we're allowed to do it, so that's the change, and at a level that allows us to move capital off the balance sheets that are constrained by the average of earnings which was through this quarter, so it will move up. But I think we try to operate 50 basis points above the minimum [Indiscernible] that target because there's volatility, so [RSR] (ph) of 5.9. We've got 90 basis points of cushion and we want to operate 50 basis points there, the 9.5 to 10, etc.  You should expect us not immediately to be moving towards that over time. And then as this goes through the periods, the question will be what's the ultimate G-SIB level that we have to maintain in the future and things like that. But we're -- we can move at pace now. And we couldn't before because we were -- it was constraint to your dividend plus your buybacks could only equal your earnings.  And we're a company that went into this crisis with a lot more excess capital, and we are a company that came out of this crisis with a lot more excess capital. And there are three CCAR exams during this crisis as we had the lowest losses and stayed below the 250 SCP. So off we go. But as you know, the constraints, you gotta go the lowest constraints, and add 50 basis points and you should expect us to stay above that. But right now, that's a lot [Indiscernible]. Steven Chubak : If I could just squeeze in one more, sorry, just gotten a bunch of questions on the global market's loan growth, which is a pretty eye-popping number. And I was hoping you can just unpack the opportunity that you're seeing within that segment, and whether there's further runway for continued growth just given how significant of an uptick we saw in the most recent quarter? Paul Donofrio : Yeah, sure. We did that activity, the loan growth was led by global markets. But we did see it across the platform, including in the market in other areas. In global markets, we just look for opportunities to use some of our liquidity in a more constructive way than maybe buying more securities.  And it was across a number of different types of opportunities and clients, but about I would say $6 billion-ish of it went into our decision to hold some CLOs in loan form. Now we concentrated those holding in AAA and AA tranches instead of distributing the securities to investors. And we think that activity is very consistent with our plans to allocate more balance sheet to customers in global markets.  Having said all that, [Indiscernible] people concentrate on CLO exposure, our CLO exposure is still extremely low relative to our peers. Steven Chubak : Fair enough. Thanks for accommodating the additional question. Operator : Our next question is from Ken Usdin with Jefferies, please go ahead. Kenneth Usdin : Thanks. Good morning. If I could just go further on the commercial loan topic. As you start to see a little bit better demand aside from PPP across whether it's corporate, which you just talked about, commercial small business, what is your sense from the customer base of where it's potentially coming back the most and where the most holdbacks are because customers still have tons of excess liquidity to get through before they borrow? Paul Donofrio : Well, look, if you look at Global Banking this quarter, middle market was driven by food products, commercial services, and suppliers and diversified wholesalers. Obviously, you've still got some industries that are affected by the pandemic, and so they really haven't started to recover yet. If you look at our commercial committed exposures.  By the way, they grew $30 billion quarter-over-quarter. We're now above the $1 trillion pre-pandemic level. But people are -- people are getting ready to borrow more. As Brian noted, the revolver utilization is still at historic lows, but we would expect that to move up as the economy improves. And then in global markets as I mentioned, there were a lot of opportunities in mortgage warehouse lending, subscription facilities, asset-backed securitization. There's lots of opportunities there to put more balance sheet to work. Kenneth Usdin : Thanks, Paul. And as a follow-up, on that point about the utility being low, but customers are readying themselves. I think as an industry we've been waiting for that for a couple of quarters now. What's that trigger point where you think we will start to see or it'll cause the line usage to actually start moving. It's been flattish for now a good -- a good few quarters as we ready for it. Paul Donofrio : I think it's going to be inventory build across various industries. Brian Moynihan : And you're seeing trade finance kick up. Paul Donofrio : Yeah. Brian Moynihan : The trade finance flows and the trade flows that we have have been kicking up and kicking up, which means at some point, people are building inventories to meet the customer demand as we talked. Paul Donofrio : Some of that inventory building has been hampered by trucking and ocean liner and just, getting logistics. I think working out some kinks there, you could start to see it. Kenneth Usdin : And do you have any line of sight as when you talk to your customers about any easing up of those supply chain constraints as we anticipate that? Brian Moynihan : Getting better but still I've learned a lot more about ports than I ever thought I'd learn from my customers. But it's getting better. It's getting better, but it's going to take a while. I mean, you've already talked about the [ship] (ph) that we all talked about, we all know, but you're talking about basics and so it's getting better, but it really comes down to the operations of ports efficiently and the impact of the virus on employees in those ports and having people to work and unload the ships and things like that.  It's a pretty drilled out analysis they have, but the reality is, it's still constraining, but it's getting incrementally better, but it'll take another 6 months to kind of [Indiscernible]. At the end of the year, it will all be better. We'll see that. Kenneth Usdin : Okay. Paul Donofrio : As you think about loan growth, and you start modeling it, just remember with revolver utilization down close to 10%, that\u2019s 45 billion up. Brian Moynihan : From last year. Paul Donofrio : Yeah. That's $45 billion alone. Just for us. Kenneth Usdin : Right. Right. That's the opportunity set is just how quickly could that be a loaded spring? Right? Paul Donofrio : Yeah. Kenneth Usdin : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question is from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead. Gerard Cassidy : Good morning, guys. How are you? Paul Donofrio : Hi, Gerard? How are you? Gerard Cassidy : Good. Paul, can you share with us, when I look at your average earning balance sheet in your supplement and you give us the yield of your average earning assets, and I think it declined to a 179 basis points.  Can you share with us, one -- what's the difference between what you're reporting and what you're putting on each quarter of new earning assets? Is there a 20-basis point difference, 10 - basis points difference? And if we assume rates don't change, when does that gap disappear? Because what you're putting on is equal to what you're actually earning. Paul Donofrio : Yeah. Well, again, I'll talk about when we take our liquidity, which again, we've got a lot of excess liquidity, and we deploy that into a security. We're picking up -- well, in the second quarter, we picked up on a blended basis between mortgages and treasuries, which were roughly 50-50 purchases. We picked up about 170 basis points relative to cash.  But when you look at a security that's rolling off and being replaced, the rolling off it's 250, and ended up being replaced at 210. Now you could do the same math -- I did it with securities. You could do the same math with a loan. Pick your loan category, whether it's a card or a commercial loan or, it's going to just depend on the yields. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And coming back, I think you pointed out that the asset sensitivity of the balance sheet is still intact. A 100 basis point parallel shift is -- leads to about an $8 billion increase in net interest revenue.  Can you share with us what weighs more heavily on that number? Is it the short end of the curve going up? Is it 70% of that increase comes from the short end going up versus the long end? Paul Donofrio : Correct. It's approximately 70% for the short end. Gerard Cassidy : Very good, Okay. Appreciate it. Thank you. Operator : And we'll go to Charles Peabody with Portales. Your line is open. Charles Peabody : Yeah. I wanted to focus on your card operations for 2 reasons : 1, it's the area where there seems to be some visibility to loan growth, and 2, because it, I think, generates about 20% of your bottom line. So it's a significant mover.  If I'm using your line of business data correctly, cards as a lot of business, are on pace to generate somewhere between 1.8 billion a quarter. So somewhere between, well, close to 8 billion a year. Am I right in that assumption? Brian Moynihan : If you're talking about interest income, yeah. If you look at the stuff on our Page 8, the 1.876 billion is the card interest income for the Second Quarter of '21. But that's \u2013 Charles Peabody : I was using your -- the net income. Brian Moynihan : The net income, we don't have a card segment - yeah, we don't report a card segment because it goes there, goes in the fee line, it goes in \u2013 and there is expense. Charles Peabody : But if you look at your line of business reporting, you do have a consumer lending versus deposit. And the consumer lending is primarily cards, if I understand it correctly. Brian Moynihan : No. It's got mortgage loans and vehicles and -- yeah, it's all lending products. So -- if you got a fifth question, we got Lee to \u2013 Charles Peabody : Okay. The question is, if I assume 2019 kind of data in terms of margins, in terms of gross yield, and I assume high single-digit growth in loans in 2022, because of the substantial reserve release this year versus what probably would be less next year, I see a fairly substantial decline in your card business as a line of business, as a profit business. And so I'm trying to get a sense, am I right that there's a delay? Even if the balances pick up, there's a delay to the improved profitability of that product line. Brian Moynihan : Because there's less reserve - last year, it was hurt by reserve build. This year it\u2019s benefitted by reserve releases. Then next year \u2013 Charles Peabody : Right. Brian Moynihan : -- that benefit comes out, that's the Company's [Indiscernible]. Charles Peabody : And not only that, but you have to reserve as you're putting on loans. And so you get less benefit day 1 versus day 100. Paul Donofrio : Yeah. But remember we've got -- I think it was -- somebody asked an earlier question before. We\u2019re reserved on loans now 200 basis points higher than where we were CECL day 1. As loans grow, you can eat into that reserve. Charles Peabody : Right. And I estimated you probably have about 1 billion to 1.5 billion of excess reserves in your cards if you go back to day 1 CECL. And so you're going to bleed some of that back in over the second half of this year, which means you have maybe 0.5 billion to a billion next year. Lee McEntire : Hey, Charlie, this is Lee. So why don't we take this offline and you and I can go through this afterwards. I see where you're headed. Charles Peabody : Okay. I'll share my model with you Lee because I think it's an important hole that has to be filled next year. Lee McEntire : Yes. What I'd also just add though, just while everybody is on the line, is just remember our charge-offs are running significantly lower. In addition -- forget about all the reserving against the balance. Charles Peabody : Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. Lee McEntire : Yeah. Okay. But I'll get with you after this call. Charles Peabody : All right. Thanks. Operator : And it appears we have no further questions. I'll return the floor to Brian Moynihan for closing remarks. Brian Moynihan : Thank you all for joining us. Once again, in the quarter, our customers are seeing good growth opportunities in the recovering economy. Deposits continue to grow, 80 billion in the quarter, loan balance is stabilized and grew on a period-end basis for the quarter. Even though we're coming in PPP runoff, asset quality is at 25-year percentage loss lows, not just dollar amount. The solid earnings continued this quarter.  We -- the important thing is we're seeing increased activity by our customer base, whether it's sales of all the different products, whether it's the reopening of the branches and more appointments that lead to sales, whether it's our face-to-face meetings or commercial businesses. So that holds us in good stead and helps answer the question about how NII grows in the second half of the year. And so -- and then on top of all that, this quarter is the first quarter in many that we've been able to -- forever that we've been able to go back and actually use excess capital based on our earnings power and our Board's discretion. You should expect us to get back in the share buyback game. Thank you, and we will return that capital to you, and we look forward to talk to you next quarter.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later you will have the opportunity to ask questions during the question-and-answer session. Please note this call may be recorded. I will be stating by if you should need any assistance. It is now my pleasure to turn today's conference over Lee McIntyre. Please. Go ahead. Lee McIntyre : Thank you, Catherine. Good morning. Thank you for joining the call to review our Third-quarter results. Hopefully you've all had a chance to review the earnings release documents. As usual, they're available, including the earnings presentation that Brian and Paul will be referring to during the call. They're available on the Investor Relations website of bankofamerica.com. So I am going to first turn the call over to our CEO, Brian Moynihan for some opening comments, and then Paul Donofrio, our CFO, will cover the details of the quarter. Before I turn the call over to Brian and Paul, let me just remind you that we may make forward-looking statements, and I would ask you to refer to non-GAAP financial measures during the call regarding various elements of the financial results. Forward-looking statements that we make are based on management's current expectations and assumptions, and they're subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause the actual results to materially differ from expectations are detailed in our earnings materials, and the SEC filings available also on our website, Information about the non-GAAP financial measures, including reconciliations to U.S. GAAP can also be found in our earnings materials, and those are available on our website. So with that, let me turn it over to Brian. It's all yours. Brian Moynihan : Thank you, Lee (ph). And good morning to all, and thank you for joining us. This quarter, the economy continued to make solid progress and our clients continued to perform well, having adjusted to the operating environment. Many companies are making healthy profits and our research team expects another strong quarter of profits by American businesses. We reported $7.7 billion in net income or $0.85 per diluted share in the third quarter, up significantly from the year-ago period. We've now earned over $25 billion for the first 9 months of the year. This quarter's strong results include some themes I want to highlight ahead of Paul (ph) going through the details on the quarter. Prior to the pandemic, Bank of America was growing and creating operating leverage quarter after quarter after quarter. As I said last quarter, the pre-pandemic organic growth machine has kicked back in. You see that this quarter, and is evident across all our lines of businesses. In addition, this quarter, we saw the return of operating leverage. We also saw another quarter of solid loan growth. The good news is that the nature of this growth has broadened in the third quarter, even as commercial banking utilization rates have improved somewhat. NII has improved significantly, reflecting the many quarters of growth in deposits and now loans. That also reflects the steady management of the interest rate risk and deployment of cash from our core deposit growth. At the same time, we still have a high level of asset sensitivity. We invest in our core deposits and that's supported stability in NII over the last year as rates and loans declined. What that did is bridge us to where we are now. This quarter where growth in loans and other factors that lead to an improvement in NII and a NIM. Strong free growth has complemented that NII improvement. And with expenses moving sharply lower, we saw notable return of operating leverage. Year-over-year, our revenue is up 12% and the expenses were flat. Our efficiency ratio is approved to 63%. As I've done in the past, I want to spend a moment on what we see in our consumer data. Let me hit a few slides beginning first on slide 3. The improvement in the vaccination and hospitalizations, all the things you know about, have seen the U.S. economy continue its reopening trajectory following a modest slowdown from the surge in cases caused by the Delta variant. There's been some discussion around the slowdown, I'll just note that the U.S. economy is now as large as it was in the pre-pandemic. Our own research team, not being in  at all, expects the U.S. economy to grow 5.5%+ this year and 5.2% next year. These growth rates are more than twice the growth rates that occurred in the pre-pandemic decade or longer. Unemployment rates continue to fall back to pre-pandemic levels. While the U.S. still has issues around labor supply, and supply chains of materials, the economy is moving along. Looking at our own customer base and consumer spending, I'd offer you a few insights. Third-quarter, total Bank of America consumer spending you can see it on the lower left-hand part of the slide. Payments were robust. They reached 937 billion up 23% over 2019 for the quarter and a similar percent of growth over 2020. September was the best month of the year, and we've seen that spending rates continue through the first part of October. Combined spend on total -- on debit and credit cards, which is a subset of this total, about 25% of it in that retailers and services remains strong. In third-quarter '21, we continue to see spending shift toward travel and in-person entertainment as well as fuel driven by both increased use in higher fuel prices. Year-to-date as you can see in the chart, our total payments of $2.8 trillion by our consumers are 22% ahead at the 2019 levels. In the chart on the right, you can see how fast the growth rates occur this year. And that's another economic sign -- signpost to the steady recovery. Now as we turn to loan growth on Slide 4, you can see this chart that we've been presenting to you for last several quarters. Why do we show you this? We wanted to show you that as we hit the bottom, the inflection point, and what happened a couple of quarters ago. And this chart gives you a sense of the daily progression across those quarters. As you can see, every loan category is thought to see an improvement. And if I showed you this by our lines of business, you would see similar progress across each one of them. Overall, ending loans, excluding PPP loans, which are in a forgiveness process, as you well know. Overall, those loans increased $16 billion linked-quarter. And if you look at the commercial portfolio, they grew $11 billion quarter-over-quarter. Compared to growth in Q2, growth this quarter was broad-based across global banking and global markets in the commercial space. C and I growth was driven in part by improved calling efforts from commercial Relations Manager that we deployed across the world, including in addition to a growing demand for credit. As you might note, we've invested in hundreds of relationship managers in our commercial lines of business, and you know, those investments are now bearing fruit. Loans with our wealth management clients continue to grow this quarter. As these customers borrow for the reasons they borrow for liquidity and asset purchases and other things. Interesting in our small business area, we're seeing the business have stabilize and start to grow. One of the areas is our Practice Solutions Group. What that group does is lend to -- lend to medical, dental, and veterinary practices. They've continued to see momentum and are on the pace for the best years they've ever had. Now, turning to consumer loans, the American consumer continues to borrow from Bank of America. Card loans grew 7% annualized from quarter two levels with increased spending. And as you well know, repayment rates trends remain high. All products on the consumer side except the home equity balances had higher balances for the quarter. The decline in home equity balance is understandable given the prepayments in mortgage loans, et cetera. But still we saw 1.5 billion in originations this quarter, up more than 50% from last year's third quarter. Now, turn your attention to slide in appendix not to cover it now, but you should take a look there and you'll see the true loan lining business on a bottom left-hand side that slide. And you'll see without the volatile PPP in and out that's occurred because the program design, the loans this year in those lines of businesses are basically within 1% of where they were last year, and we can grow out from here. Moving to slide 5, we want to show the continued reemerged the pre-pandemic growth machine of Bank of America. We give you a few highlights. Our Depo -- under the deposit side, we grew net consumer checking accounts, which are the primary transaction accounts for our consumers, 93% being primarily for the 11th consecutive quarter. This drove the continued growth in deposits in our leadership position in U.S. retail deposit market share reaching $1 trillion of deposits in our consumer segment alone. On credit cards to cross back over a million new card production. That's the same levels we were pre-pandemic. New investment accounts have increased 9% during the pandemic. Digital progress has occurred across every business and you'll see that in Paul 's slides later. And that's increased sales of products and high use of digital platforms. This bodes well for future sales levels and for future efficiency. Sales of banking products in Merrill Lynch and the private bank have remained strong and with the return to in-person meetings we should them even see them grow stronger. We have seen year-to-date assets under management flows grow and then nearly tripled compared to year-to-date '19. In markets and banking we had a near-record quarter  investment banking and equity trading revenue. So these are just a few examples of the customer growth we're seeing. A point or two on capital. This quarter's level of profits, coupled with our excess capital, allowed us not only to pay higher dividends to shareholders, but also to buyback $10 billion in shares. In total, we returned $12 billion to you our shareholders through these actions, proving that we can support our customers in a growing economy, support our teammates with great pay and benefits, and support our community sales I'll describe in a minute. But above all, and return capital to you our shareholders and drive good returns for you. Going to Slide 6. With regard to how the teams are delivering more broadly in our communities, we gave you in Slide 6 an update on our $1.25 billion commitment. To date, we have directly funded nearly $400 million, about 1/3 of that commitment. This includes $36 million in completed in equity investments in MDI and CDFIs. $300 million in equity investment commitments to minority-focused funds to support minority and women entrepreneurs and businesses. And $70 million have directed it philanthropic giving, directed at the priority shown on the slide, in addition to the amount we usually give on a yearly basis. Now it's worth noting that in addition to the equity investments, we have $2.1 billion in deposits in CDFIs and MDI, the largest in U.S. doing that. If you go to the next slide, slide 7, this is what we're doing with our customers to help them with their financial lives even better. It highlights the products and services starting with financial well-being of our retail clients, particularly in the low-to-moderate income areas we serve. This includes our commitment to our pathways program, where we hire team mates from our local communities to serve our communities and be successful in our Company as a Company of opportunity for them. We recently had to hire another 10,000 teammates from those communities -- from our communities over the next 5 years. That's because we completed the first 10,000 a year early. The unified ways in which our teammates and local markets do a spectacular job of approaching both banking from a global scale and both banking from a local community is unique and delivers every day for us. It's been a great job by our team this quarter, and I want to thank them. Now I'm going to turn it over to Paul. But as you know, Paul has been our CFO since 2015, has done a spectacular job with our Company. He's going off to help us do some interesting things in the Company, and I just want to congratulate and thank Paul for his support. I'll now turn it over to him to take you through his last earnings call. Paul? Paul Donofrio : Thanks, Brian. Hello, everyone. I will start on Slide 8 by adding a couple of comments on revenue and returns. On a year-over-year basis, revenue rose 12%. The improvement was driven by a nearly $1 billion increase in NII, and a nearly $1.5 billion increase in non-interest income. By the way, every business segment produced year-over-year improvement in non-interest income. Expenses declined from Q2 and were flat with Q3 20 despite the year-over-year improvement in revenue and related cost. Solid revenue growth while holding expense is flat, created 1,200 basis points of operating leverage and resulted in 8.3 billion of pretax, pre-provision income up 40% year-over-year. With respect to returns, our return on tangible common equity was 16% and ROE was 99 basis points, both of which improved nicely from the year-ago period. Moving to slide 9, the balance sheet expanded modestly versus Q2 to a little more than 3 trillion. After funding 9 billion of loan growth, deposit growth of 56 billion generated excess liquidity that was placed in a mixture of securities and cash. Our liquidity portfolio grew to 1.1 trillion or 1/3 of the balance sheet. Shareholders equity declined 4.7 billion from Q2 as capital distributions outpaced earnings this quarter. With respect to regulatory ratios, CET1 under standardize approach was 11.140 basis points lower than Q2, driven primarily by a reduction in excess capital through share repurchases and to a lesser degree, higher RWA as a result of commercial lending growth. The ratio was a 160 basis points above our minimum requirement of 9.5%, which translates into $26 billion capital cushion. Given our deposit growth, our supplementary leverage ratio declined to 5.6% versus a minimum requirement of 5%, which leaves plenty of capacity for Balance Sheet growth. Our T-LAC ratio remained comfortably above our requirements. Turning to slide 10, I will focus on average loan balances because they are more closely linked to NII. Note that loan growth over the past 2 quarters has begun to show signs of improved demand, and I will refer to quarter-over-quarter improvements on an annualized basis. Also note that these charts include PPP loans, which have been moving lower, driven by forgiveness. The footnotes detailed the change in PPP loans. From a peak of $25 billion last year. PPP loans have declined through forgiveness to a little more than 8 billion on an ending basis. Focusing on the link quarter change in loans and excluding PPP loans, total consumer and commercial loans grew on an annualized basis by 9% with commercial growing at 11% and consumer improving 6%. continued to benefit from security-based lending, as well as custom lending, while mortgage continued to perform solidly and global markets, we again look ed for investment-grade opportunities with clients as a good use of liquidity. In Global Banking, we saw utilization move past stabilization this quarter. But utilization rates are still 700 basis points lower than 2019, representing a $30 billion GAAP from current loan levels. In consumer, we saw credit card grow as new accounts continued to build across the quarters and credit spending continued to rebound. And importantly in mortgage, as Brian noted, we saw growth as prepayment volumes slowed. With respect to deposits on slide 11, we continued to see significant growth across the client base, adding accounts across all with deposit-taking businesses. Combining both consumer and wealth management, customer balances, I would highlight that retail deposits grew 28 billion from Q2. These deposits -- these clients now entrust us to manage more than 1.3 trillion in deposits, which is more retail deposits than any other U.S. bank. We also saw strong growth of 28 billion with our commercial clients. And remember, the deposits we are focused on and gathering are the operational deposits of our customers in both consumer and wholesale. Turning to slide 12 and net interest income. On a GAAP non - FTE basis, NII in Q3 was 11.1 billion, 11.2 billion on an FTE basis. Net interest income increased 965 million from Q3 '20, driven by deposit growth and related investing of liquidity, as well as PPP loan activity. These drivers were partially offset by lower loan levels. NII versus Q2 '21 was up 861 million. There were several positive contributors to the quarter-over-quarter growth. First, we had an additional day of interest. We also benefited from the continued deployment and growth of liquidity. Average loan growth also contributed to NII again this quarter. And we experienced an acceleration in the forgiveness of PPP loans, which improved NII quarter-over-quarter by a couple of 100 million. Last but not least, we had lower bond premium amortization expense, which declined from 1.6 billion to a little more than 1.4 billion. With respect to PPP loan forgiveness, I will emphasize that this was an acceleration or pull-forward of NII into Q3 from future periods. And as a side note, I would point out that the revenue from the PPP program has helped to defray some of the enormous cost of administering this assistance program on behalf of the government. Our net interest yield improved 7 basis points from Q2 to 1.68% driven by the improvement in NII. Importantly, given continued deposit growth and low interest rates, our asset sensitivity to rising rates remains significant, highlighting the value of our deposits and customer relationships. As we move to Q4 and assuming no significant interest rate changes, we expect benefits from expected loan growth, liquidity deployment, and lower premium amortization expense to more than offset the expected reduction in PPP revenue I mentioned. Assuming the forward curve materializes and given Q3 NII growth, as well as expectations for Q4 and assuming we see any loan and deposit growth next year, we would expect NII in full-year 2022 to be well above full-year 2021. Turning to slide 13, on expenses. Q3 expenses were 14.4 billion, an improvement of more than 600 million versus Q2. Higher revenue related costs were more than offset by the absence of the prior quarters' contribution to our charitable foundation, as well as lower costs of unemployment claims processing. Compared to the year-ago period, expenses were flat as improvements in net COVID costs, the absence of elevated litigation in Q3 '20, as well as digitalization benefits and other initiative savings were offset by higher revenue-related and other costs. As we look forward, we continue to see investment in technology and people at a high rate across the businesses. And we are adding new financial centers in certain growth markets. Turning to asset quality on Slide 14. As I've reported for several quarters, the picture is very good here. Net charge-offs this quarter fell again to 463 million orC 20 basis points of average loans. This is the lowest loss rate in 50 years. Net charge-offs were 22% lower than Q2 and more than 42% below the same quarter in 2019. Our credit card loss rate was 1.7% and several loan product categories were still in recovery position this quarter. Provision was a $624 million net benefit-driven primarily by asset quality improvement as delinquencies and reservable criticized commercial loans continued to move lower. We had to reserve the lease of 1.1 billion split roughly 80% in commercial and 20% in consumer. Our allowance as a percentage of loans and leases ended the quarter at 1.43%, which is still well above the level following our day one adoption of , especially considering the mix of loans today versus then. To the extent, the macroeconomic environment and asset quality improves further and remaining uncertainties dissipate, we expect our reserve levels could move lower. On Slide 15, we show the credit quality metrics for both our consumer and commercial portfolios. The only point I would make here is just to note the continued low level of late-stage  loans, which drives expectation that card losses could decline yet again in Q4 before leveling off. Turning to the business segments, and starting with consumer on Slide 16. Before I touch on the financials, I want to highlight what a great job this team has done in turning this business around since the pandemic. All of our businesses -- of all our businesses, Consumer Banking was the most heavily impacted by the pandemic, which at its worst, drove quarterly profits to a very narrow level before rebounding. We incurred heavy cost to protect the health of our associates and customers, and we added contractors and other resources to support the government in our own customer assistance programs. We added billions to credit reserves, depressing profits, as  mounted with respect to potential credit losses. Net interest income declined as interest rates fell quickly and significantly. Fast-forward to this quarter, and the segment's rebound has accelerated as earnings rebounded to more than 3 billion. Net charge-offs are at historic Lows and NII has rebounded, reflecting not only deposit growth, but also the value of their deposits and customer relationships. The business alone has now crossed over 1 trillion in deposits, up 16% year-over-year. Our point here is that years of investing and operating under responsible growth, positioned us to not only deliver for everyone during the pandemic, but also rebound quickly to organic growth and operating leverage. We were never down and we never stopped investing. And while this is true of every segment, the rebound in our Consumer Banking earnings is just a great illustration of the resilience of our business and our people. The segment earned 3 billion in Q3, 48% higher year-over-year as revenue, expense, and credit cost all showed improvement. Revenue improved 10%, reflecting higher card income on increased purchase volumes and higher service charges due to client activity. Net checking accounts grew more than 700,000 year-to-date, and 93% of our consumer checking accounts are primary accounts with an average checking account balance of more than 10, 000. Expenses moved lower by 6% as a result of a continued reduction in COVID costs mitigated by higher costs for minimum wage increases and other operating costs. On credit, We had a $242 million reserve release this quarter. However, the more direct indicator of improved asset quality is the decline in net charge-offs. Net charge-offs of 489 million were down 26% year-over-year and 22% lower quarter-over-quarter. Our credit card net loss rate for the quarter was 1.7% pre-pandemic, it was over 3%. On Slide 17, you can see the increase in consumer deposits, loans and investments. We covered loans and deposit growth earlier with respect to investment balances, we reached a new record of 353 billion, growing 32% year-over-year as customers continue to recognize the value of our online offering. Yes, balance grew as market values increased, but we also saw 21 billion of client flows. An important element of this growth has been the 9% growth in the number of accounts over the past year to more than 3 million. On slide 18, let me highlight a couple of points regarding the continued improvement in digital engagement. As all of you know, enrollment is important, but usage is key. We now have nearly 41 million customers actively using our industry-leading digital platform. This quarter, 70% of households used some part of our digital platform within the past 90 days, logging in more than 2.6 billion times. And while Erica and Zelle usage has been tremendous, what I would draw your attention to is the digital sales growth, which is up 27% year-over-year. Lastly, will not reflect on the slide, I would just add digital engagement has become foundational to maintaining our customer satisfaction at historic levels. Turning to Wealth Management, the continued economic reopening, client flows, and strong market conditions once again led to not only record investment balances and asset management fees, but also record levels of loan and deposits all contributing to a record pretax margin in Q3. In fact, this is the 46th consecutive quarter of average loan growth in this business. Both Merrill Lynch and the private bank contributed to the improvement and are driving digital engagement to deliver products and services to the clients. You can expect this to continue as we drive towards a modern Merrill, which is advisor-led, powered by digital. Growth in our new households at Merrill and at the private bank continued as we continue to build pipelines and move back towards pre-pandemic -- our pre-pandemic pace. Net income of 1.2 billion improved 64% year-over-year driven by the strong revenue performance. With respect to revenue  AUM fees, which grew 19% year-over-year, complemented higher NII on the back of solid loan and deposit increases. Expenses increased in alignment with higher revenue. Client balances rose to 3.7 trillion, up 20% year-over-year, driven by higher market levels, as well as strong flows of 91 billion. Let's skip to Slide 21 to highlight our progress in digitally engaging wealth management clients. The clients of this business continued to lead the franchise on digital adoption, utilizing not only digital tools to access their investments, but also other banking needs like mobile check deposit and lending. More and more clients logged in to easily trade, check balances, and originate loans all through one simplified sign-on. And through leveraging, Erica-based AI capabilities, and through use of WebEx meetings and secured text messaging, We are making it easier and more efficient for clients to do business with us wherever and however they choose. This creates additional capacity for our teams to spend more time advising existing and potential clients. Moving to Global Banking on slide 22, the segment had very strong performance with near-record investment banking fees, another solid quarter of deposit growth, and an uptake in loan demand. Strong deposit growth helped to improve NII, which complemented the continued strength in investment banking. The business earned 2.5 billion, improving 1.6 billion year-over-year, driven by both higher revenue and lower provision costs. Provision expense reflected a reserve release compared to builds in the year-ago quarter. Revenue grew 16% and included an 8% improvement in NII while firm-wide investment banking fees were up 23% to 2.2 billion down only modestly from the Q1 record level. This IB performance resulted in a number for ranking and overall fees with a pipeline that remains strong. We rank number 1 in leveraged finance and investment-grade with strong market share improvement compared to the year-ago period. We also had record M&A results. It is worth noting that we continued to see strong momentum in investment banking with our middle-market clients. As many of you know, we have been investing in our investment banking capabilities with middle-market clients for a few years now. Over that time, we have executed transactions for nearly 300 first-time IB clients, and we now have investment bankers in 23 cities across the U.S. Non-interest expense increased 7% year-over-year, primarily reflecting higher revenue-related costs and continued investment in the franchise. We've already covered much of the balance sheet on slide 23, so let's skip to digital trends on 24. Digital investments, strategies, and tactics are an enterprise effort, with earnings in one segment benefiting in another. That has been particularly true in global banking. And as we continue to invest -- we continue our investments in digital solutions, our client adoption and usage continues to grow. Enhanced Banking Solutions have helped us capture greater market share as wholesale clients do more with banking partners that are the most stable and secure and have the capability to invest in new technology that will provide better data and global integrated solutions. Switching to global markets on slide 25, results reflect solid sales and trading activity led by our equity's business. As I usually do, I will talk about the segment results, excluding DVA, this quarter net DVA was a modest loss, but the year-ago quarter had a higher $160 million loss. Global markets produced 4 -- excuse me. Global markets produced 941 million in earnings on par with the year-ago quarter. Focusing on year-over-year, revenue was up 3% driven by sales and trading. Sales and trading contributed 3.6. billion to total revenue, improving 9% year-over-year. FICC declined 5%, while equities improved 33%, recording one of its stronger -- strongest performances ever. FICC results reflected a flat yield curve and range-bound interest rates for much of the quarter with continued tight credit spreads. With interest rates moving late in the quarter, we saw an improvement in activity in revenue opportunities. The strength in equities was driven by growth and our client financing business, as well as a strong trading performance and increased client activity in both cash and derivatives. The increase in expense year-over-year was driven by increased activity-related sales and trading costs. On slide 26, we note year-to-date revenue trends across the last few years. As you can see, while our performance was elevated in 2020 during the pandemic, 2021 remains well above the pre-pandemic years presented, driven by continued elevation of client activity and volatility in the market, as well as investments made to extend more balance sheet to clients. Finally, on Slide 27, we show All Other, which reported a small net loss. Revenue declined by 109 million year-over-year, reflecting higher partnership losses on ESG investments. Expense was lower year-over-year, driven by the absence of litigation accruals in the prior period. Our effective tax rate this quarter was 14%. Excluding the tax credits driven by our portfolio of ESG investments, our tax rate would have been roughly 25%. We would expect the tax rate in Q4 to be between 10% and 12%, absent any tax law changes or unusual items. With that, we can go to Q&A. Operator :  We'll take our first question today from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Your line is open. Glenn Schorr : Hi, thanks very much. Lots of detail, I love the forward-leading commentary on NII was bigger than a bread box, size it on the expense side. Obviously, expenses go up a little bit with all this market-related and activity-related revenue.  So maybe if we could think about it, X, whatever mark is going to do over the next couple of years. You've produced great operating leverage, but -- as you still invest. Maybe you can give us an idea of what to expect, even if it's just over the coming years as you invest yet eke out further efficiency gains? Thanks. Brian Moynihan : I think, Glenn, we might take you back a little bit in history to '15 and '16 when we started seeing the efforts in the BAC and the operating excellence kick in and what we said as we bring the expenses down. And then we'd expect them to grow, you have a 3% inflationary between raises and leave aside that the market's going up as you said, and could drive a moment in time and et cetera, but if you have 3% sort of embedded in CPI type of increases in merit and rents and things like that, and what we said is through our efficiency, we could -- when we got to the floor, which was the '19 year, the idea was then to manage that to 1% net growth, and we've been able to keep working at that. With the PPP and with the COVID-related costs and stuff, it's kind of threw it all around for the last 12 months, but you'll see that start to emerge coming out the other side. So the idea would be to grow revenues faster than the economy and grow expenses at a rate of net 1%, maybe 2% if the revenue growth is stronger. And, you know, that's the operating model. And you saw that come on quarter-after-quarter of operating leverage, I think for basically three years plus 14 quarters or something like, then the pandemic pushed that around. And as we stabilize after the pandemic a couple of quarters ago, you are seeing a comeback to the system. Glenn Schorr : That's great. So it sounds like no change and still operating efficiency. Cool. Brian, what we have here, I think there was like a 7-page press release announcing all the leadership changes. It's a lot, and so I figure while we have  and talk about what's happening, how are you? Is this all-natural succession next level, stepping up, type changes? Maybe just put the right perspective around it all. Brian Moynihan : Sure. We announced -- we have teammates who're retiring. I've been CEO. This is 48th quarterly earnings conference call, so it's been a long time but -- and I would rather never have to have senior leaders move because -- but they have a choice in life and when they retire, we have to adjust to it. But what we tried to accomplish if you go back to last summer, we put a lot of senior executives onto the management team.  What has happened now with Andrew's retirement -- Tom's retirement and Andrew's retirement is those executives now are reporting directly to me. And that's really the efforts. So we were a younger, more diverse, three women, running the eight lines of business same philosophy how we run the Company.  And now with a group of people, we have your 5-10 years ahead of them and then we have two international colleagues on the management team for the first time. And Bernie (ph) and Kathy. Kathy is needed to help us in the European context as Brexit came through, it's different and that -- so she is going to go help us in that and be a great help to as Bernie has international -- does a great job for us.  But the idea was to elevate people who -- and also focused on people who are thinking 10 years out as opposed to 1 or 2 and retirement and so that's really genesis of it. You know, if people retire and we make reactions and, you know, Tom and Anne (ph) and Andrew have tremendous teammates. But the best thing they did for us, they developed a bench behind them that is extremely strong that can step into the jobs. And frankly, we're running a lot of the businesses as they -- over the last few years as they -- we all spent more time on driving our brand in the market and other things are more at the Company level. Glenn Schorr : Thank you, Brian. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Matthew O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Matthew O\u2019Connor: Good morning. Was hoping to circle back on the NII -- net interest income commentary, which was clearly positive overall. But I think you've been talking about 4Q net interest income to be up a billion versus the first quarter level on prior calls? And I think the guidance implies maybe similar to even better than that and was just hoping to get a little bit more of a point and update for 4Q NII? Paul Donofrio : Sure. So relative to the Q3, will have less and  PPP loan forgiveness. However, we think we should be able to overcome this decline and produce modest growth in NII in Q4. Through a combination of loan growth, liquidity deployment, and modestly lower premium amortization expense. Matthew O\u2019Connor: Okay. Which I think does get you, I guess to that up a billion versus the 103. Paul Donofrio : Yeah. Modestly, would imply that we tend to tell you what we could do and we do it. So that's how we run the Company so, yes. Matthew O\u2019Connor: Understood. Okay. And then separately on the expense question, you talked about kind of 1 to 2% growth long term, but as you think about next year, you obviously had some kind of COVID and I think some one-time costs in the first quarter, how would you help frame '22 costs versus '21? Thank you. Paul Donofrio : The way I would think about '22, we're not going to provide specific guidance, but as a quarterly base for 2022, just start with our rough estimate of Q3 or Q4 here. Q4 should be flattish to potentially modestly lower than Q3. So just start with that as a base and add to that the seasonal higher payroll tax in the first quarter, which is roughly 250 million. And then as Brian said, add in inflationary costs, which we've being, as Brian said, targeting at around 1%. But given the war for talent, right now, maybe you want to add a little bit more than 1% next year. And then lastly, adjust that base for any assumption you make around higher or lower revenue expectations in the areas that are closely linked to compensation and exchange fees. If you do that math, you're going to come up with I think a pretty good estimate for '22. Matthew O\u2019Connor: Okay. And anything that we can back out in terms of COVID or the PPP costs going away as we think about next year? Paul Donofrio : Yes. Look, COVID -- there's still a couple of 100 million of net COVID in our costs, just down modestly from Q2. We're seeing some reduction in COVID's costs, but we incurred some new costs as people return to the office. While there's not a lot left, it does create, I think, modest opportunity over the next year or so to get those costs out. Matthew O\u2019Connor: Okay. Thanks for all the clarity. Operator : Our next question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Mike Mayo : Hi, my question relates to tech, the front office and back-office. The front office, you have the slide number 5. So-net new consumer checking accounts up by half over the last 2 years. How much of that is directly or indirectly related to digital banking? And then my backup as question, which we don't really see.  What are you doing as it relates to the cloud, your relationship with IBM. What sort of efficiencies do you think you can get. And I think you indicated you don't plan to go 100% to the public cloud, like some of your other peers have targeted. So if you could elaborate on your tech strategy, thanks. Paul Donofrio : So Mike, on the first -- the production of net new checking accounts, and remember Mike, this is not -- you've been around us a long time, and these are core checking accounts. The primary keeps going up. It actually went from 92 to 93% over last year of primarily accounts. So the production hit this quarter was I think a 10-year high in terms of net accounts. And that's coming both from the digital 30% of sales round numbers. And we now have, to your point over the last three years, developed full digital execution in terms of account opening for core accounts in terms of auto purchases, in terms of mortgage origination, etc, which now allow the fully digital practice to take place. Half the sales are digital, the good news honestly is that as the branches reopened over the last -- and people -- the business went up, you saw the count sold rise because it takes both high-tech, high-touch and high-tech to be successful.  So the percentage of sales that digital came down, but that's because overall sales jumped up and obviously there are more brands dominate. But you got it exactly right. We think that is a more efficient method of accumulating customers. We think we have about 17% market share in the Gen-Z area that is heavily digitally originated. A lot of college, a lot of other things going on. But the key is to realize the net balances per account have gone from 7,000 to 10,000 over the last couple of years.  So you're seeing a bigger and bigger core position. When you go with -- and that's one thing to keep it in mind is when we give you our 40 digital customers, these customers are core customers with big balances. Merrill Lynch, for example. I think we're up to 70,000 or something average balance per account, not 3,000 or 4,000. But anyway, just on the cloud. The cloud is a complex question.  As you are well aware, over the last 8, 10 years, Kathy and the team led an effort to internalize our cloud, which made us a lot more efficient. And so we look at -- we run -- percentage of our business outside due to certain executions and things like that. We have 500 different software programs that run in a FA -- the SaaS basis, which is the question cloud can be misleading is can you get to the -- all the product types or capability types?  You can get out there because of the new companies that develop them on the cloud-based systems and we can get to them all. The IBM's efforts to internalize a Cloud that we can use the financial service industry and IBM is working on that. But these things have to be done carefully for purposes of security and trust and understanding our businesses.  And so far, we've come to the judgment that we're continuing to internalize and saving a lot of money and we continue to add modest amount to the cloud. But importantly, there's no restraint on our ability to tap innovation, ingenuity based on whether it's running internally or externally. Next question, please. Operator : Our next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Your line is open. Gerard Cassidy : Hi, Brian (ph). How're you. Brian Moynihan : Good, Gerard (ph). How're you? Gerard Cassidy : Can you guys --good. Can you guys share with us, You've had incredible deposit growth, as you pointed out, the retail consumer is over a trillion dollars. When the  sometime next year, can you share with us what you think will happen to deposit growth. And the second, your loan to deposit ratio, similar to your peers, is very low. How do you see growing that over the next two or three years? And where can you get it to, do you think? Brian Moynihan : Paul wants to add a few comments on the change in monetary policy, and I will talk a little bit about sort of some of that thing. Paul Donofrio : Yes. So look, we expect deposit growth to continue, although it's going to be likely at a slower rate than what was experienced so far this year. And we expect our growth to continue in line with or slightly better than the industry. You got to remember that we're entering a phase of tapering.  Taping is still QE, so deposits are really not likely to decline until many quarters to look back at historical data after QEM if they ever do. Because as the economy expands, the multiplier effect could -- we could see growth in deposits even though money supply is coming down.  So we'll just have to wait and see, but what we do know is as QE starts, we're still going to -- it's still going to be stimulative from a deposit standpoint and then as I said, if posits do decline, it will probably many quarters, a couple of years maybe after QE ends. Brian Moynihan : Gerard, just a couple of things. When looking at the consumer deposit base, sometimes, I think it's deja vu all over again, it's a classic statement, because in '15, '16, '17 it was all about the Fed's going to normalize rates and you're going to have to raise prices, and we didn't have to because we -- the reason why we don't have to is, these are core transaction accounts, in a large part, non-interest bearing. And so you'll see some of that same dynamic apply again as the rates normalize and the monetary supply has changed, but in the consumer business, 56% of the balances are checking, so that would say those are core transaction accounts, money moving in and out, very little CDs, I think 50, 60 billion bucks or something like that. So the $1 trillion is all basically in checking and money market. Can it move around?  Yes. If you look, one of the things that bodes and -- well for the economy is that if you look at a checking customer that has made $2,000 or $3,000 in balances with us, either sitting with 3 to 4 times -- 3 times what they had before the crisis. That's good news. They will spend some of that, I assume.  But interestingly enough, that's been growing month over month for the last few months. It's not going down, even though the stimulus payments to customers in large part other than the childcare stops. So one thing is it bodes well for the economy. And this isn't trying to  you to -- some viewpoint about it is there's consumers still have a lot of money in their accounts and are going to spend it.  Going back to your deposit question, could that mean those balances come down a little bit. But it would be overcome by the new accounts coming on at a million a year that carried $10,000 average balance, etc. We feel good about long-term deposit growth, and it's all -- it's driven by the check-in core transactions.  Loan-to-deposit ratio, it's our customers driving, so when the usage by the auto dealer lines was down to 25% of what it was because inventories being down, of course, we -- they want to borrow, we want to lend to them because that means they have the inventory to sell to the consumer. So this is a customer-driven business and so 900 billion  of loans against 2 trillion of deposits is largely driven by the customer activity.  The good news is you can see in those charts that I call the smile charts on the loan growth page there that the other half to smile is coming up, meaning that the customers are starting to draw on credit and use it. And that above well for the customer growing their businesses and stuff.  But importantly, thinking about just the economy generally. One of the things I just want to remind you, Gerard, is we breakout consumer and  and a lot of people talk about retail deposits. That is 1.4 trillion when -- 1.3 trillion when you combine them together. So it is a big machine and it's all transactional and we just don't think that moves as much on monetary supply questions as obviously institutional side. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Brian Moynihan : Morning Betsy. Betsy Graseck : Hi Good morning. Hey, Brian. I wanted to ask, we've got a setup into '22 that looks pretty positive especially when you think about the top-down GDP growth you're mentioning earlier, how are you leaning into that with regard to your footprint, where do you see the biggest opportunity for share or gain across your business platform? Brian Moynihan : I'd say there's a couple areas. One, as you're well aware, we've expanded the balance sheet in the markets business. And they're seeing the returns on that stronger in the equities business and good -- and Jim DeMare and the team under Tom's leadership continue to do it. But stronger in the equities business in that.  So deploying balance sheet against that, recognizing activity levels, sustaining, etc. And then if you go in the lending business, it's customer selection. So we were out with those 100 extra relationship managers banging away at the world, getting more customers the hard way. And you're seeing net new customers in the business banking, small business segments and stuff growing.  You see that in the wealth management business. So what you'll see is that the Balance Sheet deployed to markets as a capital and balance sheet question. Everywhere else that's going to follow the customer, but it's the core customer growth and that's why you put those statistics and that you see. Meanwhile, Merrill Lynch is over $300 million and becoming fairly significant enterprise on its own. And you see some of these other aspects. So we feel good about it. And like you said, Candice (ph) and the team are on a great research platform and they, they basically are 5% plus this year and 5% next year, which sets up well. Betsy Graseck : So is there an opportunity that's even larger outside the U.S. I'm just thinking about your franchise outside the U.S. borders, is that an engine of growth for you potentially here, relative to what you've been doing? Brian Moynihan : We'll invest -- we'll continue to expand our -- we have more loans in the global core of investment banking segment outside the U.S. than we do inside the U.S. We continue to expand that. Matthew O'Connor and team have done a good job. and team in corporate banking area are doing a great job.  So yes, we're going invest in that. And then the GTS, Ahmed and the team continued to develop our capabilities there, and we're getting the high single-digit revenue growth, soft deposits and fees combined together. And we continue to invest that real-time payments and it's just one thing after another.  So we're doing that, but outside, but I don't -- if the questions, are we going to change and go into the consumer business or wealth manager business outside the U.S., the opportunities in the consumer business are just -- and wealth management business in the U.S. are staggering to us.  Think about we just opened our 15th branch in Indianapolis. You and I would've been talking 4 years ago and it didn't  at any maybe as FY. We're now 7th market share, moving up strong. You look at it in Columbus and Cleveland, Cincinnati, and Salt Lake City and Minneapolis. And you're seeing us move in the top 5, 7 from 0. And that growth in the new households is running multiples of 2019 and Merrill and the private bank. There's just so much opportunity to distract ourselves, would be not the time to do it. We're in a war with the competition, and we're winning. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And then just lastly, Paul, you're mentioning how you've got bigger than a bread box on growth in NII as you look into next year, and you outlined the drivers, I'm just wondering, embedded in that is a forward curve. What about opportunity here for the forward curves to shift higher when you're thinking about the increase in NII, if we had inflation come through stronger, rates rise s soon, would that be an opportunity for you to take even more duration than you've got in the book or would you keep security duration where it is Paul Donofrio : We'd look. We have a lot of excess liquidity right now. So there's always an opportunity to deploy some of that in the future. We're always balancing liquidity, capital, and earnings and rates rise. I think we probably would have to study whether we want to deploy some of that liquidity at higher rates.  We've got our interest rate sensitivity disclosure, which is probably the best way to talk about the opportunity if rates were to rise. It sits today because of our liability insensitivity, the value of those deposits and customer relationships that Brian just talked about, that's sitting at $7.7 billion for a parallel shift, 70% of that's on the short end. So that gives you a sense of maybe the opportunity here as rates rise. Betsy Graseck : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Research. Your line is open. Jim Mitchell : Hey, good morning. Maybe just a question. One of your peers this morning talked about the impact of  adoption. I think he disclosed that standardized RWS could grow 7% to 10%. Is that a similar impact for you? Just trying to get a sense of how you think about the adoption of that. Paul Donofrio : We already adopted Sachar, I think and that was a benefit for us in markets. Jim Mitchell : Really? Paul Donofrio : Yeah, Lee can come back to you with the details. We were the first to adopt. Jim Mitchell : Okay. Well, that's great. Then -- so when we think about the buybacks, the 10 billion, the acceleration of buybacks this quarter is, should we just expect that acceleration to continue to -- until you get towards your target of around 10 to 10.5%. Paul Donofrio : Yes. I mean, it's simply put. We manage it dynamically. The Board manages it dramatically on a quarterly basis. And what's happening is if you look at where we thought we'd be, we're in it with more capital because we're earning more money. And then we clean up a little bit here and there, but we're working towards over a multi-quarter period towards where -- back towards our target and we'll continue to focus on that. Jim Mitchell : Okay, that's great. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Charles Peabody with Portales. Your line is open. Charles Peabody : Actually, my question was asked, but on the NII, if you just extrapolate, third, fourth-quarter kind of guidance, you're looking at a mid-single-digit rate of growth year-over-year in 2022, and I think you used the word modest NII growth is expected for 2022. In that, what sort of yield curve or nominal rate environment are you assuming to get above or towards that level? Paul Donofrio : Let me just correct, because I think either you didn't hear us right or we said something wrong. But we're expecting modest NII growth from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. Charles Peabody : Oh, okay. Paul Donofrio : Yeah. We gave some perspective in the initial comments that I made about '21 versus '22. We're not really providing specific guidance on '22, but let me just give you a couple of reminders and qualifiers that it's going to depend. NII is going to depend on loan and deposit growth, and we expect both of those to continue to grow consistent with a growing economy.  We also expecting lower premium amortization expense over time consistent with the path before rates. When -- all the guidance we ever give you is always dependent on the forward curve at that moment. So assuming the current forward curve and given our expectations around improving NII in the second half of this year, we've already booked the third quarter. I've given you guidance on the fourth quarter. That one could expect I think robust improvement in NII, comparing the full-year '21 versus the full-year '22. By the way, I want to correct one thing I said earlier. I mentioned that our asset sensitivity 100 basis points rise parallel shift to the curve was 7.7 -- it's actually 7.2, so sorry for that. Charles Peabody : But -- so on the interest rate structures, what I'm thinking about and please help me here, there's a significant amount of liquidity on bank balance sheet that's being put -- waiting to be put to work, and I'm wondering if that doesn't put a, somewhat of a cap on how much rates can rise. And then you're going to have some decline in treasury issuance because of a declining budget deficit. And then you're still going to have QE yield through the first half of next year, so you got a lot of demand for a shrinking supply on the treasury side. So that's why I'm curious what sort of rate structure either nominal or curve wise you're anticipating going forward. Paul Donofrio : All the factors you're talking about go into -- we -- we use the curve and so all you market participants in all of the debate, we don't use some internal estimates, we've always used the curve of it don't know that for a long, long time going back a couple of decades, that's how we build that estimate of asset sensitivity based on the forward curve at the time at the end of the quarter whenever we got. Charles Peabody : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Steven Chuback with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Steven Chuback : Hi, good morning. And thanks for taking my questions. So I wanted to start off with one, just on the tax rate guidance. And Paul, you've always provided  color on how to think about some of the potential fee income drag as well associated with those ESG related investments, recognizing that the impacts are intended to be P&L neutral. I was hoping you could help size just how we should be thinking about the other income drag related to the guidance for 4Q and whether you guys would consider a potential change to the accounting, just given all the noise and volatility that that creates in the Income Statement. Paul Donofrio : Yeah. Look, we expect our ESG activities to increase over time, so as we go into '22 and '23, and as we've long talked about the fourth quarter is generally the highest for that pretax -- for that loss that we book in other income for entering into these partnerships. I do think it's important to remind everybody. I know, you know it, but I'll remind everybody that these partnership losses are booked in other income. But they are more than offset in the tax line. So as we grow these activities in the future, there will be a small headwind to revenue growth, but not to net income growth given the tax benefits of these investments. As you think about modeling, everybody out there, we expect the fourth-quarter loss to be 800 million on the other income line from these tax investments, or even perhaps a little higher, reflecting both that typical seasonal increase in the fourth quarter and partnership investments, as well as there were a few deals in the third quarter that got delayed because of all the logistical stuff.  And we think they're going to pop into the fourth quarter. Beyond that, putting the fourth-quarter aside, a good modeling assumption for the normal three-quarters of '22, I would say, absent unusual items. It will be a quarterly loss of 400 to 500 for those ESG investments, Again, in the other income line, more than made up for in the tax line. Steven Chuback : Thanks for that color, Paul. And just for my follow-up, I know you guys are reluctant to give some explicit expense guidance for next year, just given the sheer amount of inbound that we've gotten after you made your remarks. I just wanted to have these provide some ranges and just see if we're thinking about things appropriately.  It does sound like the 14.4 billion we saw this quarter annualizing that is the jumping-off point that gets us to 5076. You have the 250 million of additional incentive expense -- seasonal expense, sorry, that you spoke to that gets us to 5079 and then that's the starting point for thinking about how much incremental growth somewhere in that range of 1 to 2%. Is that the right way to think about it? Paul Donofrio : You've got some but not all the components because you got the COVID-related expenses and what happens next year. But I think the leading thing for everybody to focus on is what's the headcount because , if you think about the expense base, it's dominated by people and buildings and equipment they operate on and positioning them for success.  And that headcount and  drifting down as it has because the impact of the runoff of some of the special programs that we had 0.5 million PPP loans to medium customer, Brian Moynihan : deferral applications, the unemployment payments, all those stuff it's going down, and that's coming down, so client-facing investments and technology stuff that goes up, but we continue to engineer the back-office, so watch that number, I think it was 209400 this quarter, 411 if I got it right, down for the quarter, down for the year. Managers are down about a 1,000 in the Company round numbers at this point, and we just continue to manage that down. So you've got the component parts that have come clear. We brought the run rate back down to flat year-over-year and we'll continue to work on it. Paul Donofrio : Yeah. The only other thing I would add, Brian, if I may; we're clearly focused on managing expenses well, but what we're really focused on is creating operating leverage. And that -- you saw that this quarter. And that's how we really think about the business model. We've got to grow revenue. And in terms of expense growth, we've got to grow expenses slower than we're growing revenue, and we've given you the 1% framework. Steven Chuback : That's great. And just one quick follow-up, if I may, just on the securities yield. You guys actually saw some nice expansion there. I know that's going to be reflective at least in part of some of the premium and benefit that was cited. But I was hoping you can maybe help frame how large could that benefit be from premium if prepay bids really start to normalize in earnest somewhere closer to pre-COVID levels.  And then separately, just where are you reinvesting along the curve and how you're thinking about duration, risk, appetite, given the size of your MBS portfolio? Brian Moynihan : Yeah. If you think about premium amortization expense over time, it's going to depend on the path of rates. And I just would remind you that prepayment lags, movements and mortgage rates, people kind of focus on the 10-year.  It's about mortgage rates and they lag that by a little more than two months and I would also just remind everybody that as you think about premiumization expense, it's also important to really remember that the size of the  securities portfolio has increased a lot year-over-year. So all those things sort of have to go into your -- into your modeling. Steven Chuback : Understood. Thanks for taking my questions. Operator : Our next question comes from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Your line is open. Ken Usdin : Thanks. Good morning. Just a question or two on the card. Interesting to see that your purchase credit card volumes continued to grow really nicely and debit did come down a little bit. So that the overall interchange fees, just wondering if you can talk through what you're seeing in terms of the underlying trends there, and was that stimulus starting to change as far as debit?  Was at delta variant? What do you see in terms of the forward outlook for, in terms of your views of spend trend and balances and card. Thank you. Brian Moynihan : Sure. Well, look, in card income, just a couple of points to make just so no one's confused, when you look at our sort of Consumer Banking card income fees, they were up very nicely year-over-year at about 8% driven, as you said, by the purchase volume increases despite the fact that payment rates are still relatively high. But when you look at the consolidated line, you're not going to see that. That's up only slightly versus Q3 '20 because of the decline in card income associated with processing unemployment claims, which sits in global markets. Just for some clarification there. In terms of balances, look, we're expecting card balances to continue to improve.  The balances grew 7% quarter-over-quarter on an annualized basis, including some small growth and revolving balances. And we opened over a million new accounts, which now matches pre-pandemic levels. I think balanced growth reflected higher spend and the reinitiated marketing efforts that we've talked about, including promo offers.  While again, payment rates remained elevated. We expect higher Q4 seasonal purchase volume, and that's going to drive additional balances in cards. Paul Donofrio : Yeah. I think just a couple of things. You got the balance question on cards, but you do always have to look at the spending side of it. And we said -- debit and credit cards are only about 20% of the way consumers spend money out of their accounts. Cash, all the ATMs, checks written. Zelle is taking off and becoming a meaningful amount of the payments. I think in -- but cards are an easy form of payment. We're already seeing  tap cards or things at 12% of the spend, 12% of the penetration already, but the good news is, no matter how you cut it and how you look at it, two good messages, card balances are growing, but there's still tremendous capacity for the consumers to borrow if they want to, to do things. Brian Moynihan : The second thing is that the spending levels are growing at 10% growth rates. In an economy in the U.S. which is led by the American consumer, that is a tremendous amount of spending that's going on, and it's accelerating, even as the stimulus is not in the rearview mirror by quite a -- many months. So as people get back to work and higher wages and things, there's just more money to spend.  So I think the focus on card as a spending vehicle versus a borrowing vehicle,  something we look at, but if we like the business, we continue to generate a million new cards as Paul talked about, and it will break down about who needs to borrow and what, and the asset quality is unbelievable. The NIM is as high as it's ever been, and that's a good business. Ken Usdin : Great. Thanks a lot, guys. Operator : Our final question comes from Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer, your line is open. Brian Moynihan : Morning, Chris. Chris Kotowski : Good morning, and thank you. I'm trying to disaggregate the strength in net interest income. And if I -- just wanted to make sure I have all the moving parts right. The PPP revenues were up 166 million, and amortization was down 200. It still implies a $500 million or roughly 5% linked quarter growth in NII up against, say, 1.5% average loan growth, if I have that right.  And is there an explanation for that strength? Is it the securities you put on or is it -- how did it become quite that strong? Brian Moynihan : You got to add an extra day. Chris Kotowski : Extra day. Okay. That's 1% more. Brian Moynihan : And then what you get is -- what you're left with, I think is the loan growth for two quarters now, and we took in a lot of deposits quarter-over-quarter. We put some of those towards the loan growth. We put some of those in cash, and we put some of those in the securities portfolio. Chris Kotowski : Okay. And if you had to guess, with the size of the securities portfolio that you had now, if you were in a, say, 2017 kind of rate environment, the billion for an amortization currently, what would that go to if you can say? Brian Moynihan : If you can look at that by just tracking the CPRs and make your estimates. You know the size of portfolio in the basis, but just backing up a little bit, loan growth -- in the first quarter we said -- we thought we're seeing the stabilization and there's a lot of people formulated against that saying, wait, how can that be true? The second quarter we said -- in the second-half quarter especially we saw growth.  All that loan stayed on the books plus we grew it on top of that, as we said earlier, at $60 billion excluding the PPP. That's what's going to build into the NII projections going forward because that's 250, 300 basis points spread stuff. And remember, we're funding with 0 cost deposits to the tune of 2 or $300 billion up year-over-year. So that's what drives -- that's what will drive it long-term. Short-term, it'll be all the things you talked about, but that's going to stabilize at somewhere at this point and then take -- and then it's really going to come back down to what we do on the banking side of balance sheet, make loans, take deposits, and make the spread between them.  And the best news is the NIM percentage actually started moving up and that shows you that the stabilization leads to that coming through as we grow the loans. Chris Kotowski : That was an awesome quarter, thank you. That's it for me. Thanks. Brian Moynihan : We agreed with that. That's all. Thank you all for your attention. Just to close the quarter out, I could just take Chris's comment and say we returned to organic growth trends in pre-pandemic. we saw a solid loan demand, good revenue growth, 12% year-over-year expenses, flat year-over-year for great operating leverage at 12% returning to that effort to drive that quarter-by-quarter to make the great investments to drive the franchise at the same time, having expense disciplined 12 $12 billion of capital, went back to this quarter.  We continued return the excess capital and all the current earnings because frankly, we can grow without retaining capital because of the core way we run the business on a risk basis. We continue to do what we need to do in our communities outside the same time. And just in closing, I want to thank Paul for his services as CFO and we look forward to Allison and team taking over next quarter. Thank you. Operator : This does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at anytime.",

Later, you will have the opportunity to ask questions during the question-and-answer session.  Please note, this call may be recorded. I will be stating by if you should need any assistance. It is now my pleasure to turn today's conference over to Lee McEntire. Please go ahead. Lee McEntire : Thank you, operator. Thank you for joining our quarterly earnings call. Good morning to everybody. I\u2019m sure, by now, you've all had a chance to review the earnings that were released before 7 :00 this morning. As usual, they\u2019re available, including our earnings presentation that we will refer to during the quarter on the Investor Relations section of the bankofamerica.com website. I'm going to first turn the call over to our CEO, Brian Moynihan for some opening comments, and then we will hear from Alastair Borthwick, our CFO, who will cover the details of the quarter. Before I turn the call over to Brian and Alastair, let me just remind you that we may make some forward-looking statements, and refer you to the non-GAAP financial measures during the call regarding various elements of our financial results. Our forward-looking statements that may be made are based on management's current expectations and the assumptions therein and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause our actual results to materially differ from expectations are detailed in our earnings materials and the SEC filings that are available on the website. Information about the non-GAAP financial measures, including reconciliations to those can also be found in our earnings materials that are available on the website. So, with that, let me turn it over to Brian. Take it away. Brian Moynihan : Thank you, Lee, and good morning to everyone, and thank you for joining us again. I hope all of you continue to manage safely through the new variant. First, I'd like to start this call by recognizing that Paul, our CFO for many years, has now moved on to help us with our efforts helping our customers make a just transition to a low-carbon footprint, and I want to thank him for his many years of service. And welcome Alastair to the call, our new CFO has been in that role since November 1st, and he's off to a great start, and you're going to hear from him in a minute. So just stepping back on the cover slide. Today, we reported $7 billion in after-tax net income or $0.82 per diluted share. That's up significantly from the year-ago period. This quarter was a repeat of the themes we discussed with you in the last few quarters, the pre-pandemic organic growth engine that is Bank of America is fully back in place and producing success. We had strong organic and responsible growth across all our businesses. We grew revenue and produced positive operating leverage. We continue to see very strong asset quality metrics. We support our clients and their need for capital. And we made further progress in support of local community efforts across all our markets. I want to congratulate importantly and thank our 200,000 teammates around the globe for all the great work they did in 2021 that enable us to deliver for our clients, our team, our shareholders and our communities. Let's go to start on slide 2 and a few comments about our full year results. This quarter capped a record year of $32 billion in earnings for 2021 and represented significant growth in net income over 2020. We even saw a more significant growth in EPS as share count dropped. We generated more than $7 billion of earnings in every quarter in 2021. Revenue grew 4% year-over-year and activity gained momentum throughout the year. NII grew well in the second half of the year, which complemented fee growth, especially in our markets-related businesses. Wealth Management, investment banking and sales and trading revenues were all strong in '21. NII, recall that in the first quarter 2021, we noted at the time that our expectation is that quarterly NII could progress, up by $1 billion per quarter as we entered the fourth quarter. And in fact, we have recorded fourth quarter NII that is $1.2 billion or 12% better than first quarter '21. Our teams managed well through the rate volatility, and we grew loans and deposits with our customers as the year progressed. That sets us up nicely for 2022, and Alastair is going to talk about that in a minute. Expense was well managed, but expense did go up as we continue to invest for growth. That's axiomatic. Our COVID-related costs remained elevated and revenue-related costs grew. So, while we do not see full year operating leverage, we did, however, return to strong operating leverage in each of the last two quarters of the year, restarting our streak that we had before the pandemic. Credit remains stellar through 2021. Charge-offs consistently improved each quarter. Our commitment to responsible growth remains well placed. We are growing faster than market and keeping credit costs in check. The economic improvement and our strong credit allowed us to release much of the reserves we built in 2020. When you look at the balance sheet, we grew deposits $270 billion in 2021. That was on top of the $360 billion of growth we had in 2020. Our loan growth accelerated throughout the year. Fourth quarter represented the strongest quarter of organic loan growth we have experienced at Bank of America. Now, of course, that's absent the first quarter of 2020 at the start of COVID, which had $70 billion of panic drawdowns in a few weeks. At the end of the day, we produced strong ROA and a 17% ROTCE for you, our shareholders, and we returned $32 billion in capital during the year. Let's go to slide 3. The best way to highlight the drivers behind the earnings success is to look at the momentum in client activity across the businesses. This shows organic growth engine is running hard. More and more of this client activity is powered by our digital transformation, which is foundational to everything we do. We are proud of our digital stats and continue to spotlight our results later in the materials as usual, see pages 24 to 28. But some key stats on this page. Consumers logged into our digital channels more than 2.7 billion times in the fourth quarter alone. Erica, our digital financial assistant, completed more than 400 million requests from our clients in the year 2021. Half our consumer sales were digital in the fourth quarter. 86% of all the check deposit transactions are now digital. Customers used Zelle to transfer $65 billion in the most recent quarter. The number of Zelle transactions now surpasses the checks written by our consumers. Cash flow approvals by our commercial and corporate clients to move money grew 240% since the pandemic. So the digital journey continues, and that supercharges our relationship manager-driven model. And together, that has driven the growth in loans and deposits and fees. Net new checking accounts have grown in each of the past 12 quarters. This contributes to the continued growth in our core deposits. This also demonstrates the extent of our leadership position with U.S. consumers and deposits. We have $1.4 trillion in deposits from all American consumers. On credit cards at roughly 1 million new accounts in the fourth quarter alone, that's now operating at the same level of new card production as it was pre-pandemic. We're going to continue to drive that opportunity. When you think about consumer investments, Merrill Edge, as we call it, we opened 525,000 new accounts in the year 2021. Those accounts carried -- new at opening, $70,000 in balances for each of those accounts. This demonstrates the deep penetration of the mass affluent customer base of America. Sales of bank products in both Merrill and our Private Bank teams have remained strong. Now when you combine Merrill, the Private Bank and consumer investments, they produced more than $170 billion in net client flows in 2021. In Global Banking, we had record years of investment banking fees combined with strong GTS results. In Global Markets, we saw record equity sales and trading revenue. These are just a few examples of the types of client activity that are driving market share gains for our company. As I've done in the past, I want to spend a few minutes on the broader economy, and I use our own customer data to make a few points. Let's go to slide 4. First, on consumer spending, I'd offer a few thoughts. We are a provider of choice for individuals and businesses when paying for goods and services. Our award winning and easy-use capabilities across all forms help clients budget, save, spend and borrow carefully and confidently. We look at all forms of consumer spending, including ACH, wires bill pay, P2P, cash and checks. Many firms and many people discuss credit and debit spending, but as you look at the chart on the lower left-hand side of page 4, you can see that 80% of the money moves in other form. So, what happened in 2021? Well, consumers spent record amounts in context on comparing '21 against the pre-pandemic period of '19. And you can see that in the upper charts on both sides of the page. Bank of America's 67 million clients made $3.8 trillion in total payments during 2021. That was an increase of 24% over pre-pandemic levels, an all-time high. Fourth quarter and December payments also reached record highs. Fourth quarter payments were up 28% over 2019. And December payments were up 30% over 2019. These are the dollar volume payments, but likewise, the numbers of payments were up double digits also and showing more work and more activity. Just focusing on debit and credit spending, for the holiday period of November and December, spending was up 26% over 2019. This data confirms that consumers continue to spend into the holiday season. And so far this year, that strength continues. For all the spending of all types through January 17, 2022, we have seen it up over 11% versus the start of '21, which is well up over '20 and '19. That bodes well for the rest of the year and quarter. Focusing on the channels of payment, in the lower right-hand chart, as you'd expect cash and check volumes are down 24% for 2021 compared to '19. This simply means more and more customers are using our digital capabilities to achieve their goals each year. Now importantly, though, this allows us to grow our consumer business with lower cost. We believe there's lots of potential spending capacity left as average deposit balances continue to move up to the end of the year, despite the heavy spending you see. We had one segment, one cohort of deposits that dipped for one month out of the last part of the year. In November, we had a small dip in customers who had $2,000 or less in their balances pre-pandemic. They dipped by 1%. Other than that every cohort from June, July, August, September, October, November and December all grew every month. And what's striking is that the balances for people had less than $2,000 average balances before the pandemic, they're now sitting with 5 times the balances they had pre-pandemic. For those customers at $10,000 in accounts before the pandemic, they're now sitting with 2 times in their accounts. The teams track this data carefully and it shows the spending power left in the American consumer. Another economic signpost worth noting with our customer activity was acceleration of loan growth in the fourth quarter. Earlier this year, we -- earlier last year, we talked about the green shoots of loan growth we saw in the first quarter, and we saw that turn into growth as we move through the quarters, culminating with $50 billion in record loan growth this quarter. We note these borrowers, both consumer and commercial, have strong capacity to continue to borrow if they so desire as lines across the border and low-usage status. We provide slide 5 to show you the daily outstanding loans again this quarter, which gives you a sense of progression across time. Every loan category saw improvement this quarter except for home equity. But I would draw your attention to on slide 5 is the addition of the pre-pandemic starting point to give you some reference. Well, some of the growth this quarter was in Global Markets, and that business ebbs and flows with the market activity. $35 billion of that $50 billion was in the core consumer and commercial books. So far in January, the businesses other than Global Markets continue to show growth over the end of the year. So, let's start and talk about the commercial portfolio where we have moved above the pre-pandemic level for the most recent growth. Commercial loans, excluding PPP, grew $43 billion or 9% linked quarter. Compared to quarter three, growth this quarter was broad-based across all segments of commercial lending. We saw improvement in both new loans as well as improving utilization from existing clients. This reflects the intense relationship manager effort our teams have done and -- across the last couple of years and adding more and more relationship managers. Commercial loans of Wealth Management clients extended their growth trend this quarter as these customers barred for various liquidity needs for asset purchases. In small business lending, the all-important small business segment, lending activity is running consistently above pre-pandemic levels. And especially in our Practice Solutions Group that supports medical dental and veterinary practices, we continue to see continued momentum and finished one of the best years across all small business with our Business Advantage rewards cards. Turning to consumer loans. Card loans grew $4.6 billion or 6% from quarter three levels. This occurred as spending increased and even occurred as payment rates paying off the card completely trended higher for the quarter. Card balances still remain well below the pre-pandemic levels of $95 billion, and we continue to push that opportunity. Mortgage loan levels grew 2% linked quarter as origination remained at high levels and paydown slowed down. On the next, slide 6, I would like -- I would say that while we delivered capital back to our shareholders, $32 billion, and we invested in our teammates, we also continue to invest in our communities through our local teams across the country focused on our markets. I call out the reference in the bottom of the slide, middle -- bottom middle of slide 6 to the sweeping changes we announced last week in our NSF policies. These updates continue the work we began over a decade ago to simplify our product set and allow a great experience for our clients and an efficient capability for our operations. Eliminating NSF fees and reducing the overdraft charge per occurrence from $35 to $10 and the other changes we're making is a big win for our clients. It's going to have an obvious impact on those fees, which have fallen dramatically since 2009 and 2010, but currently run about $1 billion in '21, and we'd expect them to drop by 75% over the next year or so. With that, let me turn it over to Alastair. Alastair Borthwick : Thank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to take us to our fourth quarter results on slide 7, focusing on comparisons against the prior year quarter. And I'll also talk through the high-level commentary on slide 8. As Brian noted, we produced $7 billion in net income, which grew 28% from fourth quarter '20, while earnings per share of $0.82 improved at a faster 39% pace due to our share repurchases. Looking at our top line improvement on a year-over-year basis, revenue rose 10%. The improvement was driven by a $1.2 billion increase in NII and a little more than $800 million increase in noninterest income. Each business segment produced strong noninterest income results. And as you look at significant components of revenue, it was pretty consistent through the quarters in 2021. One important aspect of responsible growth has been to grow consistently and sustainably. And I think we executed on that in 2021 with investment banking over $2 billion each quarter; sales and training -- trading near or above $3 billion each quarter; investment and brokerage services revenue over $4 billion each quarter. With regard to expenses, our revenue-related costs increased, and we continue to make investments in our people and our capabilities to grow the franchise. At the same time, lower COVID costs and further digital engagement have helped to offset some of those increases. In the fourth quarter, revenue growth outpaced expense growth on a year-over-year basis, which produced operating leverage of 400 basis points and a 19% year-over-year improvement in pretax pre-provision income to $7.3 billion. With regard to returns, our ROTCE was 15%, ROA was 88 basis points, both of which improved nicely over the year. Moving to slide 9. During the quarter, the balance sheet grew $85 billion to a little less than $3.2 trillion, and this reflected the $100 billion of growth in deposits. These deposits funded $51 billion of loans growth. And we also added $14 billion in securities, and so our cash increased by $68 billion. Partially offsetting these increases were typical year-end moves in our Global Markets balance sheet. Our liquidity portfolio grew to $1.2 trillion or a little more than a third of our balance sheet and shareholders' equity declined $2.4 billion from Q3, driven by the $8.9 billion of capital distributions, which once again outpaced earnings in the fourth quarter as it did in Q3. With regard to our regulatory ratios, CET1 under the standardized approach was 10.6% and remains well above our 9.5% minimum requirement. The CET1 ratio declined 50 basis points from Q3, driven by excess capital reduction as well as an increase in our RWA due to the strong loans growth. And we're happy to see that capital usage increasingly needed to support customers and to fuel their growth, while still producing plenty of capital to return to our shareholders. Earnings alone in the most recent quarter contributed 45 basis points to our CET1 ratio before the other capital impacts of share repurchase. Given our deposit growth, our supplemental leverage ratio declined to 5.5% versus a minimum requirement of 5%, which still leaves plenty of capacity for balance sheet growth. And our TLAC ratio remained comfortably above our requirements. Turning to slide 10. We included the schedule on average loan balances, but in the interest of time, I don't have anything to add beyond what Brian noted earlier. Moving to deposits on slide 11. We continue to see significant growth across the client base as we deepened relationships and added net new accounts across our deposit-taking businesses. Combining both consumer and Wealth Management customer balances, I would highlight that retail deposits grew $48 billion from Q3. Our retail deposits have now grown to nearly $1.4 trillion, and we lead our competitors. We also saw continued strong growth with our commercial clients. And remember, the deposits we're focused on and are gathering are the operational deposits of our customers in both consumer and wholesale. Turning to slide 12 and net interest income. On a GAAP non-FTE basis, NII in Q3 was $11.4 billion. But I know, as investors, you tend to focus on the FTE NII number, which was $11.5 billion. So, focusing on the change on an FTE basis, net interest income increased $1.2 billion from Q4 '20 or 11%, driven by deposit growth and related investing of liquidity. NII versus Q3 of '21 was up $319 million, driven by deposit growth and then higher securities levels as well as loans growth. Premium amortization declined roughly $100 million to $1.3 billion in Q4, and the positive NII impact of lower premium amortization offset lower PPP fees. Given continued deposit growth and low rates, our asset sensitivity to rising rates remains significant. It's modestly lower quarter-over-quarter as long-end rates moved higher, and we recognized some of that sensitivity in our now higher reported level of NII. So, I'd like to give you a couple of thoughts on NII expectations for 2022. First, I want to start by reiterating Paul's comment last quarter that we expect to see robust NII growth in 2022 compared to 2021. That assumes we see continued loans growth and the rising rate expectations embedded in the forward curve. And in the first quarter specifically, we expect two headwinds. First, there are two less interest accrual days in the quarter. And as a reminder, we picked those back up in the subsequent two quarters. Second, we expect less PPP fee benefits. Combined, those two headwinds add to about $250 million. Despite those headwinds, we would still expect Q1 to be up about a couple of hundred million from Q4 and should grow nicely each subsequent quarter in 2022. Again, that's of course dependent upon the realization of the forward curve and some loans growth. Lastly, as we see the forward curve now expecting a new rate hiking cycle to begin, we added slide 13, as we thought it might be helpful from a historical context to see the trend of NII across the years since the last rate hike cycle. And what I draw your attention to is the stark difference in the size of our balance sheet today. And because of that balance sheet differential, today's NII is already at the NII level we saw when we were well into the middle of the last rate cycle. And importantly, our short-end asset sensitivity today is twice what it was in the third quarter of 2015 as that cycle began. Okay. Let's turn to costs, and we'll use slide 14 for that discussion. Our Q4 expenses were $14.7 billion, an increase of $291 million from Q3. Higher revenue-related costs, and to a lesser degree, seasonally higher marketing costs drove the increase. As Brian noted at the mid-quarter conference, our Q4 expenses were a bit higher than we anticipated when we ended the last quarter. Revenue continued to hold up well, and the company had a good year, both resulting then in higher incentive costs. Compared to the year-ago period, expense growth was driven by incentive costs associated with all of our markets-related improvements. As we look forward, we continue to invest in technology and people at a high rate across our businesses, and we continue to add new financial centers in expansion and growth markets. So, let me say two things about 2022 expenses. First, relative to Q4 expense, we expect Q1 to include two elements of seasonality. We typically experience seasonally higher payroll tax expense, and that was about $400 million in 2021. Also, Q1 is typically our best period of sales and trading revenue which results in modestly higher associated costs. Second, with regard to full year 2022, our best expectation currently is we can hold expenses flat compared to 2021, which finished just below $60 billion. This guidance incorporates our expected continuing investments, strong revenue performance and the inflationary costs we experienced in the second half of 2021. It also relies upon our continued expense discipline, operational excellence improvements and the benefits of digital transformation to deliver the operating leverage we seek. Turning to asset quality on slide 15. The asset quality of our customers remains very healthy and net charge-offs this quarter fell to a historical low of $362 million or 15 basis points of average loans. They continued a steady decline through the quarters of 2021, with Q4 down $100 million from Q3 and down more than $500 million from Q4 last year. Our credit card loss rate was 1.42%, and that's less than half of the pre-pandemic rate. It improved each quarter during the year. Several other loan product categories have been in recovery positions throughout the year. Provision was a $489 million net benefit in Q4, driven primarily by asset quality, and macroeconomic improvement and was partially offset by loans growth. This included a reserve release of $850 million, primarily in our commercial portfolio. And on slide 16, we highlight the credit quality metrics for both our consumer and commercial portfolios. Turning to the business segments. Let's start with Consumer Banking on slide 17. I'll start by acknowledging what a strong year the Consumer Bank has had as they generated nearly $12 billion of earnings, which is 37% of record year results for the company. Consumer opened over 900,000 net new checking accounts. And in fact, this quarter represents their 12th consecutive quarter of net new consumer checking account growth. And in turn, consumer grew deposits by more than $140 billion. They opened 3.6 million credit cards and grew card accounts in 2021 by more than any of the past four years. This helped card balances grow in Q4, despite payments remaining high. They also opened 525,000 new consumer investment accounts. And that helped us to reach a new record for investment balances of $369 billion, growing 20% year-over-year as customers continue to recognize the value of our online offering. Yes, market valuations grew balances, and we also saw $23 billion of client flows since Q4 '20. So, Q4 was a strong finish to these results. And in the quarter, the business produced $3.1 billion of earnings off $8.9 billion of revenue and manage costs well. Our 8% revenue growth was led by NII improvement as we continue to recognize more of the value of our deposit book. And while revenue grew, expense declined by 1% year-over-year, generating over 900 basis points of operating leverage. Lower COVID costs and increased digital adoption by clients more than offset our continued investments in people and our franchise. This expense discipline has now driven our cost of deposits to an industry-leading 111 basis points. Net charge-offs declined and we had $380 million of reserve release in the quarter. And as you can see, and as I already noted, deposits continued to grow strongly both year-over-year as well as linked quarter. Importantly, our rate paid remained low and stable. Turning to the Wealth Management business. Bank of America continued to deliver Wealth Management at scale across a full range of client segments. The continued economic progress, strong market conditions and the efforts of our advisors contributed to strong client flows and net new household growth. This allowed Wealth Management to generate more than $4 billion in earnings in 2021, up more than 40% from 2020. In Q4, this powerful combination of Merrill Lynch and our Private Bank produced records for revenue, earnings, investment balances and asset management fees as well as record levels of loans and deposits. In fact, with regard to loans, this is the 47th consecutive quarter of average loans growth in the business. It's consistent and it's sustained. Q4 net income was $1.2 billion, improving 47% year-over-year and driven by strong revenue growth, good expense controls and lower credit costs. Revenue growth of 16% was led by strong improvements in both, AUM and brokerage fees as well as higher NII on the back of solid loan and deposit increases. Expenses increased 8% in alignment with the higher revenue and resulted in 800 basis points of operating leverage. Client balances of $3.8 trillion rose $491 billion, up 15% year-over-year, driven by higher market levels as well as very strong net client flows of $149 billion. Within these flows, deposits grew $68 billion year-over-year to $390 billion, and loans grew $21 billion year-over-year to $212 billion. And that loan and deposit growth is further evidence that more and more Merrill and Private Bank clients are using the bank's products broadly. Net new household generation is getting closer to pre-pandemic levels as advisors are meeting in person more with clients and are building their pipelines back following the shutdown during the pandemic. This quarter, Merrill Lynch net new households of 6,700 and Private Banking relationships net new of 500 were both up more than 30% from the year-ago period. The clients of this business continue to lead our franchise in digital adoption, utilizing digital tools to access their investments and also for other banking needs like mobile check deposits and lending. The evolution is forming a modern Merrill, which is advisor-led and powered by digital. Moving to Global Banking on slide 19. The business momentum through the back half of the year was strong. Net interest income grew on the back of accelerating loans growth. Investment banking fees reached record levels and deposits continue to grow as clients navigated the pandemic. We also saw strong demand from our clients around ESG investments driving improvements in bottom line results. Net income for the full year was a record $9.8 billion or 31% of the company's overall net income. The business earned $2.7 billion in Q4, improving nearly $1 billion year-over-year, driven by higher revenue and lower provision costs, partially offset by higher expenses. Revenue improvement of 24% year-over-year reflected more than 30% growth in investment banking fees in this segment, and net interest income increased 18%. This investment banking performance allowed us to gain market share and record number 3 ranking in overall fees in what was a very strong Q4 market. We ranked number 1 in investment grade and number 2 in leverage finance with market share improvement compared to the year-ago period. And we also saw another record M&A period. And most importantly, our investment banking pipeline remains quite healthy. Provision expense reflected a reserve release of $435 million, compared to a $266 million release in the year-ago period. And what I draw your attention to here is the reduction in net charge-offs year-over-year from $314 million in Q4 of '20 to small recoveries in Q4 '21. That year-ago period included some losses from clients in those industries that were heavily impacted by COVID. Finally, given the strength of revenue we saw expenses increase by 12%, which is still only half of our increase in revenue. Switching to Global Markets on slide 20. Full year net income of $4.6 billion reflects another solid year of sales and trading revenue. This included a record year for equities, up 19% versus 2020. Investments made in this part of the business are seeing good results as our financing clients are doing more business with our company. As we usually do, I'll talk about the segment results, excluding DVA, even though net DVA was negligible in both Q4 '21 and Q4 '20. In Q4, Global Markets produced $667 million in earnings, $167 million lower than the year-ago quarter. Focusing on year-over-year, revenue was modestly down, driven by sales and trading. Sales and trading contributed $2.9 billion to revenue, a decline of 4% year-over-year. FICC, down 10%, while equities improved 3%. FICC results reflect a weaker credit trading environment in Q4 '20, and the strength in equities was driven by growth in client financing activities and the multiplier effect. Year-over-year expense move was driven by investments in revenue-related sales and trading costs, partially offset by the absence of costs associated with the realignment of liquidating business activity to the all other units in Q4. Finally, on slide 21, we show All Other, which reported a loss of $673 million, which declined a little more than $250 million from the year-ago period. Revenue declined as a result of higher volume of deals, particularly solar, and partnership losses on ESG investments. That's offset by the tax impact in this reporting unit. Expense increased as a result of costs now recorded here after the fourth quarter realignment out of Global Markets, which was partially offset by a decrease in various other expenses in the segment. That realignment obviously had no bottom line impact on our company, overall. As a reminder, for the financial statement presentation in this release, the business segments are all taxed on the standard fully taxable equivalent basis. And in All Other, we incorporate the impact of our ESG tax credits and any other unusual items. For the full year, the effective tax rate was 6%. And excluding the second quarter '21 positive tax adjustment triggered by the UK tax law change and other discrete items, the tax rate would have been 14%. Further adjusting for ESG tax credits, our tax rate would have been 25%. And looking forward, we would expect our effective tax rate in 2022 to be between 10% and 12%, absent any tax law changes or unusual items. And with that, I think I'll stop, and we'll open it up for Q&A. Operator :  Our first question today comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Glenn Schorr : Okay. Thank you. I'll try to ask this as easy as possible, but in the wave of a couple of other companies in the space talking a lot about comp inflation and stepped-up investments, I think a lot of shareholders love to see and hear your comments about, all else equal, flattish expenses in '22. And so, the simple enough question is what -- how do people take comfort to know that you're making all the right investments to continue to compete and take share and migrate digitally, like you have been doing but we're seeing so much competition across all your business lines. So, just looking for some warm fuzzy blanket words of encouragement. Alastair Borthwick : Well, I'll just start, Glenn, by reiterating what you just said. You just said we're taking market share. So, I'd say, we've sustained our technology investments all the way through the pandemic. We've sustained our financial center renovations. We've sustained our marketing. We've sustained our investment in relationship managers. And the result of that is, in many cases, record client experience. And you can see, I think, in our numbers that we're doing more business with our existing clients. We're adding net new clients and we're growing market share, and we're getting the third-party recognition as well. So, I think it\u2019s results is how you will judge us on the technology, but we're obviously very competitive in that regard. Brian Moynihan : So Glenn, let me just throw a couple of things. One, obviously, it's axiomatic that revenue from markets-related business, whether it's in wealth manager or investment banking teammates or it's in the markets business. So Jimmy DeMare and Matthew Koder and Andy and Katy have done great jobs and that's just -- that's a given, they're going to go up. And you see that. Those numbers are up dramatically over the last couple of years as markets have raised, but you invest a lot of ways. So, we'll never have the temerity to say that we know every possible competitive thing could happen over the next decade in this company. But if you look across history, which is what Alastair's referring to, we've invested new technology development, $3 billion to $3.5 billion year after year after year, and we tend to invest in things that work and then drive them and scale them. And so, you see that if you look at pages 24, 25, 26, 27 and just start to think about what we said earlier, Zelle is more transaction count than checks written. Think about that change. Think about the change in the branches that basically in our expense guidance, we'll open 100 new branches this year on top of the 200 and some of what we've opened in the last three years. But importantly, we shifted from other places in that we brought branch count overall down as we've been doing that. That means we're opening up new markets, gaining market share, as Alastair said, and using the expense base and others. So, whether -- and then in our broad-based teammates, we basically have gone to $21 an hour. Our attrition rates are similar to where they were in '19, which was a 10-year low. So, think about -- we've invested heavily, we've invested broad-based, but you're seeing the activities going. And if you start to think about the retail deposits per branch or multiples of other people, so you think about the -- we have 4,100 branches, we have $1 trillion in consumer deposits and $400 billion of wealth management. So, that operating leverage is what we do. So we're an operating leverage company. We're not a cost takeout company anymore, we haven't been. But we see the path forward of flat expenses next year. And frankly, there was a lot of onetime stuff that went through the last couple of years that is coming to an end. And that we'll reposition that to help pay for the types of things, revenue-related growth and investments that we think are important. But just look at those stats and see what we've done, and I think that that's where we get the confidence. Operator : The next question comes from John McDonald with Autonomous Research. John McDonald : Good morning. Alastair, I was wondering if you could unpack the outlook for robust net interest income growth in \u201822. Kind of wondering what kind of loan growth assumptions are you building in for the year? And how do liquidity deployment and premium amortization assumptions also factor into your outlook? Alastair Borthwick : Okay. So, let's start with loans growth. We're pretty optimistic on loans growth. You can see on slide 5, just the consistency, that's daily. You can see the consistency of the growth, it's broad-based across all the businesses, as Brian noted. And obviously, it's accelerated recently. The thing I find interesting about slide 5 is you've really got to adjust for the size of the economy today relative to where our loans were in 2019 pre pandemic. So, we know there's some potential for catch-up there. And we can see that in our data too, John, our revolver utilization rates are still lower than historic levels. So, we feel like there's some potential there. And in things like card, payment rates are still elevated. So, there's a variety of things there that make us feel good about loans growth, certainly more bullish than we might have been in a pre-pandemic GDP-type 2% to 3% kind of an environment. So, we're pretty optimistic on loans. I think, you need to think about that in the sort of high single digits. And then, when it comes to -- you can see when we put forth our asset sensitivity numbers, that $6.5 billion for a parallel shock is meant to give you an idea of how we believe we're levered to rates. I'd say about 75% of that is probably the short term, probably 25% is the long end with things like premium amortization, and that's probably how we break it down. John McDonald : Okay. And then, as a follow-up, can you talk a little bit about how you're managing to your capital minimums? What kind of cushion do you want to keep to the SLR? Just remind us the target on CET1? And how do buybacks, which seems like you've accelerated in the back half of '21, how does that factor into the overall calculation of managing growth and capital? Thanks. Brian Moynihan : Sure, John. We -- if you go back, John, for many years in our discussions, we've had excess capital despite the many ways that the capital process increased the capital requirements for large companies like ours, including the introduction of the G-SIFI buffer, et cetera, et cetera, and then the stress testing in SLR, et cetera. So, we've always said we'd maintain 50 basis points to 100 basis points of cushion. We're now getting closer to that. But the reality is that we are seeing the kind of organic growth that is what you want us to see investing in the client franchise, whether it's in the markets business, having 20%, 25% more balance sheet deployed in seeing that pick up and having a amount of revenues, whether it's the deposit growth that we're now $2 trillion deposits and $1 trillion in loans and that's growing well. So, expect us to have a different equation, which is we'll still pay out dividends around up to 30%, like we said. We used to say the other 70% would come back to you. Now, there'll be some for organic growth if in fact we get down to the 10.5% levels and the rest we repurchased on a quarterly basis. But at an earnings rate of $7 billion, there's a lot of capital deployment even embedded in there. Operator : We'll go next to Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Mike Mayo : Hi. I guess, first, Brian and then Alastair. You talked about the benefit of higher rates. But I think for you and the industry, it's the benefit of better relationships to the extent that relationships are sticky as rates increase. So, if you can just give some metrics around retention? And then specifically, as -- last year, you gave an NII guide of $1 billion higher. Can you give us some sense where you expect NII to be from 4Q '21 to 4Q '22? Thanks. Brian Moynihan : I think, on your very last point, Alastair gave you the starting point and gave you a robust, strong enough, because it depends a little bit on the path forward. We're $6.5 billion of rate sensitivity to 100 basis-point increase, as we said. So, we'll let you figure out when those rate changes come through. But backing up to your broader point, Mike, at the end of the day, in the consumer business, what drives our capabilities there is the preferred group of customers that are 80% plus the balances and retention rate through preferred rewards and the millions of people we have in it is 99% plus. And those customers have tremendous relationship with us. And we invest across whether it's the -- but for rewards, as you know, go across the whole business and not just by products. So, those customers get rewards in credit cards, they pay for by giving us deposits. You go to the Wealth Management, you can see if you look at the stats, you can see the strong growth, not only what you'd expect in the AUM side, but the client flows and deposits and other products as the -- we continue to drive the core deep relationship across in the Private Bank, but importantly, Merrill, across all the different segments. And even as we enter new markets where we didn't have banking capabilities, Columbus, Ohio, for example, there was robust Merrill capabilities we're building underneath. So, that relationship. And as you move to the commercial side, it's the same thing. So, our deposits in commercial are strong. They are all operating deposits, the lion's share of them. They're part of what we core do, but they build off the back, so that great relationship management practice and the GTS capabilities, of which we invested billions of dollars in across the last things. And what sails that altogether is not that these are resilient group of enterprises that I'll go off and operate is the common things that they have together, which are things like the digital capabilities, which we give you the capabilities that that backbone goes across all our customer sets, and that enables us to drive it and also how they work together in the markets. We will set a record -- in '21, we ended up getting back to where we were referrals from one business to the other in every market. And those are important ways that we cement the relationship. Our Commercial Banking Investments group, as we call it, has millions of customers through our corporate relationships that have priority access. So, it is about how you build the franchise and concentrating on eight lines of business and how they work together. Our merchant sales are back way over where they were when we had the joint venture, our 401(k) engagements are way up. And again, that's going through the franchise. So, we feel good about the relationship side, if that\u2019s your point. Mike Mayo : Well, Brian, aren't you tempted to take some of the -- assuming you get $6.5 billion of benefits, aren't you tempted to take some of that and spend more because it seems like you're letting that fall to the bottom line. What are your considerations when you say, we'll let that fall the bottom line instead of making additional investments? And also, what do you think about expenses, say, in 2023? Brian Moynihan : Well, I think when we -- we're flat next year, we -- Mike, if you remember back leading in the pandemic, I think, 20 quarters of operating leverage in a row. We are -- but we are starting to make the turn from expenses going down and then flattening that we're going to have to start growing again to allow for the rate of investments in compensating our teammates well, et cetera. And so, we feel that that rate of investment is embedded in the run rate. And would we start to grow expenses at some point? I think, that will be based on really some of the market-related revenue and incentives that drive it. But we still have a lot of room to go on a day-to-day basis and cost takeout in this company from -- and then reinvesting that in OpEx and stuff. It is -- think about that check, two years, 24% less checks going through the system. That's by driving those capabilities allows us to be more efficient. So, it will go to the bottom line because frankly most of that value comes off the consumer franchise, which has been investing heavily in whether it's Merrill Edge, whether it's a card business, whether it's the rewards, which are a huge investment in our client base, meaning that the charges go up and the revenue doesn't go up as much, that's actually investment. And whether it's the branches and the new branch in new markets and then -- but Dean and the team have been expert to repositioning the expense base to more efficient execution. Mike Mayo : So, do we start counting again the number of quarters in a row that you achieved positive operating leverage, you're at 2. You try to break that a 20-quarter record or... Brian Moynihan : Well, we're at 2. So, if we've got some room to go. So, we're working on it, Mike, and we'll keep plugging away. But you know us, we know how to manage expenses in this company. I wouldn't be here if we didn't think we could do it the right way and invest. And so, I think people should be confident that we count heads, we're down 4,000 people in the quarter -- in the year from . And all those people are going to make more money because they've had a fabulous year, but the reality is we keep managing the overall human countdown, which is our biggest cost. Operator : We'll go now to Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global. Jim Mitchell : Maybe a question on credit. I think we're all sort of ignoring that now, but you've seen your all-time low net charge-offs, particularly in the card business. I think the consensus is that we'll see a normalization process in the back half of this year and into '23. But we're not seeing any change really in delinquencies. Are you in the camp that we're going to see normalization? What are the drivers of that, or is there some sort of behavior mix change among customers that maybe we can be a little bit more optimistic on charge-offs over the next 18 months? Alastair Borthwick : Well, Jim, we're seeing the same thing you are. So, when we're looking at our 30 days past or 60 days past or 90 days past, they're staying at those same low levels you talked about. When Brian talked about customer balances being elevated in some cases, up 5 times where they were pre-pandemic, that's probably what's accounting for a lot of the consumer credit quality improvement. We're anticipating at some point, it will go back towards more normal historical levels. We just think it's going to bump around here for a little while. So, we don't see -- we don't have a particular time line on that at this point, but I'm not sure we'd be betting on behavioral change. Jim Mitchell : And then, just as a follow-up on the Wealth Management business. There's a nice acceleration in new households and deposit growth and net flows. But even as FA headcount kind of trickles down, I guess, how are you improving productivity there? And do you see a time where you start to see net FA headcount grow to kind of accelerate that growth? Brian Moynihan : Yes. Jim, if you look at the quarter-by-quarter progression on that in the supplement or something, you could see it's starting to flatten out. A lot of that adjustment in the recent past has been due to the work that Dean and Andy did with Aron Levine and others on the combined training program. So we're training -- we had two training programs running and et cetera. We combine all that. And so that now has sort of stabilized. And so, you'd expect us to see slow growth out. For the Merrill Edge customer, it's largely a digital execution, and that's where the real growth comes and that's sort of infinitely leverageable. That deposit -- that balance is there, $300-plus billion, 500,000 new customers growing well. And for Merrill, in the Private Bank, it is people, and you'll see that flat out come up. But that had largely due to the repositioning of the training program that the team has accomplished. And so now, we train one set of advisers. They have different career paths in our company, but it makes us more efficient going to the ability to keep managing expenses. And so, you're seeing good household formation, the marginal productivity of our advisors is through the roof, and you can see that. But the reality is you want to have the growth in flows in that $170 billion for the year is a pretty substantial increase over any year past. I think it's either twice or almost 3 times. So, we feel good about it. And the year when -- remember, we still couldn't meet face-to-face with our clients a lot. It's not the easiest year to develop business too. So, the team did a great job. Operator : We'll go now to Erika Najarian with UBS. Erika Najarian : I just wanted to ask Alastair a follow-up question on NII. In that $6.5 billion number, what kind of deposit repricing is embedded in your sensitivity? And as you look at potential actual performance for the year as opposed to the sensitivity, how should we expect total deposits to trend in terms of growth or attrition and also repricing? Alastair Borthwick : Okay. So, obviously, it feels like right now, we're at the beginning of a new rate hike cycle. And so, we're looking back towards 2015 to 2019 as the most recent rate hike cycle. During that period, Erika, we had deposit rates at probably between 20% and 25%, somewhere in the middle of that. We'd like to think this time around, it will be something similar, hopefully a little bit better based on what we've learned and based on the value we add to our customers. And then, in terms of deposit growth, we have deposit growth moderating back towards more normal growth over time, just recognizing we're coming off of two years of extraordinary monetary and fiscal stimulus. Erika Najarian : Just to confirm, given the deposit growth that you're seeing, you mentioned that most of your growth is concentrated in operating accounts. You don't expect declines in deposits as rates rise? Brian Moynihan : We didn't see it last time. From '17 to '19, we saw our -- we continue to grow deposits better than the industry and they grew throughout that period of time. And so, because of the nature of what they are, we get the economists to go through all the withdrawing of the things and because of some of the off-balance sheet financing the Fed has put together. But as a strict matter, the last time we did not see deposits go down as the Fed's balance sheet shrank by -- from 8 trillion or whatever the peak was down to around 4. Erika Najarian : Got it. And just taking a step back -- this question is for Brian. Brian, one of your closest peers, JPMorgan, sort of gave a medium-term ROTCE target of about 17%. And as you think about BofA over the next few years, when you think about normalizing rates, your comment about self-funding the investments, a much bigger balance sheet, I don't think we've seen high single-digit growth in quite some time. As you put all of that together, what would you tell your investors what your ROTCE medium-term target would be in a normalized rate environment? Brian Moynihan : We've always said that our job is to keep that well in excess of our cost of capital, and we've done it. And I think, again, because of the leverage and rate increases, instantaneous impact to business like the consumer business, which doesn't need any more capital to grow. We feel good about it. But we have focused people on that we'll continue to grow the earnings at returns that are -- we used to say 10% to 12%, now I'd say, 15%, and we'll continue to do that. But we need to balance the broad nominal returns of growth. And last year, we had good ROTCE, and we expect to maintain that. Operator : The next question comes from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Matt O\u2019Connor: You made some significant announcements on overdraft NSF, and I think you framed the drop versus 2010, if I remember correctly. But just how much should we be modeling if that goes down in the next couple of years, say versus the '21 level? And then also remind us what else is in service charges. I think you have a bunch of commercial fees and there's always some confusion in terms of what that is. Alastair Borthwick : So, let's start with NSF OD, what Brian outlined is we think it's about $1 billion in there, will come down over time, probably around 75% of that this year, just to give you some idea. Obviously, we're making those changes as we update systems and processes, et cetera. So, that's some in February, some in May. I think, Lee and his team can help you with timing, but that gives you a ballpark for how to think about that. And then, just ask me the service charges. Just explain that one more time. Matt O\u2019Connor: Yes. I think a lot of investors look at service charges and think it's all consumer, but I think there's a lot of commercial fees in there, too? And just what exactly are those? And remind us like how those react as interest rates go up. Brian Moynihan : Yes. So, those are the GTS fees, so global transaction services. So, people can pay us cash fees or they can pay us with balances at which we get the earnings rate and we get them a credit, as you all know. So generally, when rates go up, the dollar value of the earnings credit goes up and therefore, people shift a little bit to that. So, Lee can take you through some of the dynamics. But yes, there'll be pressure on that fee line, but we'll be earning money a different way. Believe me, all in, you make a lot of money, and it's different for largest companies versus small businesses and things like that. So, it's a complex thing. And it also comes back to how you -- the deposit betas in the commercial business that Alastair referenced earlier. Also in that fee line is monthly maintenance fees for accounts on both the commercial, small business and consumer side. There's other things in there. But the NSF is the one that we -- in OD we wanted to focus on, which we gave you about $1 billion and change and it's down 75%. Other than that, it ought to bounce around and kind of go up or down a little bit, but I wouldn't be too overly worried about the other pieces. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay. That's helpful. And then, just a quick clarification question. Alastair, you mentioned about high-single-digit loan growth in '22. Was that on a full-year kind of average basis or a period-end, or what -- how would you frame that? Alastair Borthwick : Yes. I'd say that's kind of a full year kind of a growth rate average. And I would just say, it's early in the year, but we're -- I guess, what we're trying to impress upon you is we're pretty optimistic based on everything we've seen. Operator : We'll take our next question from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Ken Usdin : Just wanted to follow up on the rate sensitivity in the NII outlook, obviously, what you give us in the $6.5 billion is the banking book. Can you help us just understand the rest of the balance sheet, the institutional part that's I think, historically more liability-sensitive? What's the best way of us trying to understand like how that nets out in terms of the true underlying benefit from rates as we move higher overall for the balance sheet? Alastair Borthwick : Yes. So, we'd say our markets business, generally speaking, is pretty liability-sensitive. So, the short end will have a modest impact negatively on us. And then, it's -- liability, it works in our favor on the long end. So obviously, when we're carrying things short, longer assets, we end up making some money there. So, it's probably a few hundred million negative at the short end over a 12-month period. It's probably a couple of hundred million positive at the long end over a 12-month period, but that's ballpark how to think about it. Ken Usdin : So, it's really not a meaningful net down impact then? Alastair Borthwick : No, not compared to our asset sensitivity. The part of the franchise is liability price insensitive deposits. Ken Usdin : Yes. Okay. And on that second point about the deposit growth is just outstanding. And you mentioned earlier that it's good to see the good stuff growing, but you are getting tighter on your SLR and your CET1 versus your targets. So, as you go forward, would you consider issuing more press to keep that buffer-free, or is it more that you just let the balance sheet grow and take the RWAs at the trade-up of lower buyback? Alastair Borthwick : So, I'll talk about the SLR, I think Brian talked about CET and buyback earlier. But obviously, with SLR, we've got a couple of different levers there. One is prefs. As you saw in fourth quarter, we issued $1.3 billion in pref, which obviously get some more balance sheet flexibility where we need it and when we need it. And look, I'd just say, when we have customers coming in here about to establish a relationship with us for the course of the next 50 years or in the case of commercial clients for the next decades, we're going to make sure that we're in a position to take their deposits and establish that relationship for the long term. Ken Usdin : Yes. That's exactly why I asked. Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : We'll take our next question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Alastair, a question, just as we think about securities reinvestment in this rising rate environment, should we think about you trying to keep pace with where the yields are today and shortening the duration of the book, which reduces potential AOCI risk, or should we anticipate that you would be more likely to keep duration where it is and benefit from a yield pickup as rates rose? Alastair Borthwick : So, I'd say, with respect to our securities reinvestment, right now, we're finding that we're -- we've got the kind of loans growth that we want to see, generally speaking. It's obviously -- we've come off a period where we didn't see that loans growth. So with the excess liquidity, we were in a position where we were looking primarily in first securities. Now we're moving more towards loans. So, if you looked at our last -- this last quarter, we added $51 billion loans. We added $14 billion in securities. Now, we're obviously going to be careful with respect to the OCI impact. And when you look at our balance sheet, you'll see most of the securities available for sale, our treasury swap to floating. So, that's going to have obviously a pretty substantial offsetting effect to anything that happens with higher rates. And then, I'm not sure we're going to necessarily change our duration profile around the securities portfolio. Remember, we have a lot of that rolling off every quarter, and then we tend to just book more back in the stack over time. So, with any luck, we'll continue to see the loans growth. That will be our primary focus. Betsy Graseck : Okay. No, that's great. Very helpful. Thank you. And then, Brian, I know we talked a lot about reinvestment in the franchise and the platform, I wanted to ask that question for a slightly different angle. We get -- obviously, we're all very well aware of fintech competition and what's going on technologically speaking, that enables not only competitors in the banking space, but nonbanking space to be more active in finance. When you think about your current platform, is it at the end state that you want, or is there more to do with regard to leveraging cloud and AI to enhance the efficiency of the organization overall, or maybe that's not even a potential outcome of shifting the technology? Maybe there's something else I'm not thinking about? Brian Moynihan : I don't -- I think cloud -- AI is different. The cloud -- our internal cloud is what we do with external has largely do with cost flexibility, security, who -- what program -- what apps, applications that we're running and how do we do that. But security and the ability to integrate it and ability to be never down and things like that are high on our minds. So I put that aside, the ability to continue to improve our platform is infinite. And you see it. I mean, you could have asked me this question two quarters ago, and you would have had -- if you look at the pages in 24 to 27, look at the statistics from two quarters ago. And what drives these changes is things like Erica going from 17 million users to 24 million users and 30 million interactions to 120 million fourth quarter last year to fourth quarter this year is because of the feature functionality and capabilities of it go up. Our life plans, 7 million people I think are using them. They have 20%, 25% more balances because of what they're doing. So, we'll never be at end state. I mean -- and that's where we continue to drive investment. Digital sales capabilities. We're only starting to be able to take full advantage of it, frankly, across the platform because you had to get end to end, you had to get it all knocked together and then -- and it's kind of interesting because it's growing quickly now. So, small business capabilities, the whole merchant services, we finally got a new platform out of a cost of $300 million. It's now being sold. Those are major investments. So, the question is do we appeal? We open twice the population rate for young -- for people between the ages of 18 and 24 in terms of new accounts. We seem to be gaining share in that segment and the usage by segment is high. And so, we feel very good that our platforms appeal to -- obviously appeal to every cohort of age and experience, and that's what driving that. And then, look at Merrill Edge, 500,000 new accounts, $70,000 average balance. Those are deep clients with real money put into work. And so, are we satisfied? Yes, we can look at and look at all the awards and the growth and feel good -- and feel spectacularly good about it. But you can be satisfied that way, but that would be dangerous. So, we continue to invest, and you can see the numbers of patents we get, we see everything, we will continue to invest heavily in this platform. And what it takes us to is still ahead of us. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And when you think about where you are leveraging the technology in the consumer and wealth versus maybe the high net worth piece of your business versus the institutional piece, are you -- do you feel like you're running a pace at each of those, or is there more -- significantly more due in one of the sleeves? Brian Moynihan : I think, the investment in the commercial cash management side is just as we continue to drive global business continues to be high. And I'd say -- as I met the team there, continue to challenge themselves to how much more we could do with the investment. We've invested in merchants. Now we've got to sell it and Mark, Monica and team are driving that. And so, there's -- I think there's a different -- again, this is a group of businesses that have commonalities and differences. And the investment in markets, technologies and stuff is critically important, but we built the data capabilities, I think, called courts over the years at $1.5 billion cost that enables us to build on that platform for risk and finance in markets. And then, now, we're continuing to enhance that. So, I'd say, each one is a different story. But all will be better and all -- we're investing heavily, and we make choices about -- the biggest constraint is doability, how much stuff can you get done. It's not the money. It's really a question you got to make sure you do it right and don't screw it up in and that it's going to really stick to the ribs when you start driving. Operator : We'll go now to Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Steven Chubak : So, I wanted to start off with just a clarifying question on some of the ESG investments. I know you provided the guidance on the tax rate of 10% to 12%, which includes that benefit from those investments. Versus 2021, is there any incremental drag to other income that we should be thinking about as the pace of those investments steadily builds? Alastair Borthwick : Yes. So, Steven, I think we're continuing to do more with our clients in terms of the ESG side. So, I think when you're modeling, I'd use, say, $400 million to $500 million for Q1 to Q3, and then I'd use just a few hundred million higher for Q4. Steven Chubak : Great. And just a question on -- a follow-up on capital. I was hoping you could just provide some early insights or perspective into how you're handicapping the impact of Basel IV adoption in the U.S.? How you think you're positioned relative to peers given lots of significant changes to the regime, some positive, but also quite a few negative? Brian Moynihan : Like any other regulatory change when it comes, we'll deal with it. But these things have impact, so, like you said, plus and minus and life will go on. It's -- it may cause the staff to adjust a little here and there, but we still have optimization ahead of -- the optimization ahead of us in the balance sheet that we can continue to work. But when they develop a real -- when the set of rules get developed and put in front of us and become final, we'll implement them. But my guess is it won't be anything that we -- it won't be as dramatic as going from $60 billion of required capital, $175 billion in tangible common equity over the last decade, believe me. Steven Chubak : Fair enough. And if I could just squeeze in one more follow-up. Just a clarifying question on the NII guidance. Just to help with benchmarking versus peers have all guided on '22 NII based on the forward curve. I was hoping you could provide just more explicit guidance for full year '22 NII if, in fact, the forward curve materializes. Alastair Borthwick : Yes. So look, one of the reasons we don't provide full year is because we don't control what the Fed does in terms of number of hikes nor the size of each, nor the timing. And those things we can control like expenses, we're quite comfortable with. So, I think, beyond any guidance we've given today, Steven, I would just follow up with Lee probably. Operator : We'll take our final question today from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Brian, can you share with us your thoughts? You guys have committed to, I think, it's $1.5 trillion in sustainable finance commitments out to 2030. And I'm not asking so much on the climate change and that type of risk. I think we all understand that. But, can you share with us what the financial risk is? When you think about your credit card receivable delinquencies, obviously, if the unemployment rate was to double or triple, those delinquencies, obviously, would go up. So, we could kind of measure where we think delinquencies could go based on economic activity. But what should we be looking at when it comes to sustainable finance, just some of the risks that we used to be aware about there. Again, not the climate part. I'm thinking more of the financial part. Brian Moynihan : Well, at the end of the day, these are companies and projects that have to be underwritten. And so, some of them don't go well, some of the renewable things don't work the way people want them to. So, it's a good -- and you got Bruce Thompson, the team in credit and Geoff Green and his team in risk, I think our track record of underwriting credit is strong. And so there's a business plan and our investments are to help our clients make the transition. We already invest $80 billion to $100 billion, and this is a step-up from that as we move forward into 2021, it's a step-up. So, it's not some, we've got to go out and do things we haven't been doing. We have to just do more of what we've been doing. Each individual deal is underwritten. So, what's the risk? The risk on the renewable side doesn't work and the risk on the other side is the value of assets comes down because the cash flows start to get impaired by regulation, customer change and things like that. And so, as we go forward, an additional consideration of the business plan of a heavily emitting industry will be -- will its business model sustain in change in customer behavior and use of things. In the near term, demand for all energy is going up. And the challenge for society is how we meet the needs to have a just transition occur for everyone while changing the emission structure. But over time, business plans of both the emitter side and the renewable side will come cleaner based on customer behavior. People like ourselves, reducing our demand for energy, it impacts our power companies and how they supply and our demands of our power companies do more renewables, that's going to reverberate to our 30,000 middle market clients and our millions of small businesses piece by piece by piece. So, I don't know if that's entirely where you're going, Gerard, but it's going to come down to good core underwriting, given the circumstances of the individual company, its business and its plans and what its transition plans are and the disclosures they make to us the underwriting process. But we've done a great job in commercial underwriting. You'd have to agree with that over the decade. So, I think we'll adjust each deal and each quarter, each deal and each company in each portfolio as we move along. Gerard Cassidy : No, no, that is helpful. Thank you. And you have done a good job with the underwriting, absolutely. The follow-up question, Brian, you've expanded into some new markets. I think you mentioned on the call today, maybe Columbus, Ohio, if I recall, it was a relatively new market and Minneapolis, Minnesota. Are there other markets that you intend to expand into like you've done in those two markets, or are you all set, you're satisfied with the expansion physically into new areas of the country? Brian Moynihan : Yes. So, a couple of things. One, to why we expand these markets. We first -- this is a prioritization. We first looked at the largest markets that we weren't and said why aren't we there, because we're a nationwide brand and capabilities. And by the way, in a lot of those markets, we had Wealth Management clients. So we started in '14, it's been a long effort. So we did Denver starting in '14 and Minneapolis, Indianapolis, Pittsburgh, Salt Lake, Columbus, Cincinnati, Cleveland, and now Lexington. So there's a list of other markets that we continue to go down, largely starting -- originally the key was to close the top 30 markets, which we weren't in 7, if I remember, Gerard, at the time, and we're now in all those. So there's really -- think of the next several years as being -- going down to the top 50 markets, which starts to cover a substantial part of the population where you aren't. But also even within those markets, take Grand Rapids, Michigan, we're not to the level we want to be there. And by the way, in a place like Columbus, we're now number 5 in the market. We grew at 9%. We only have 12 financial centers and state will be another 8, 10 type of number. And so, we're still building out in these markets, and it's working. I mean, it works because of the way we do it. So, that will all be a move. But expect us to keep working down by population markets, but think about 2 dimensions. One is more markets. And the second is also making sure every market -- what we do is we look at the -- we look at like markets and compare them, same size, capabilities. And we expect every market will get to the seventy-fifth  percentile of Bank of America business comparative. So why is that? So that means like even in Los Angeles, we're a 4% or 5% Wealth Management share, if I remember right, versus D.C., where we have equal representation in consumer, D.C. were 15%, 20% market share in Wealth Management. That means we should be 15% in L.A. That's a heck of a lot of work that Andy and Katy and team have to do. So we look at this that way in terms of trying to drive our market share by market. Sometimes it's people, sometimes it's branches, sometimes it's advertising, sometimes it's charitable work, sometimes community work, all the above. But think of us as trying to close out most of the U.S. population centers over the next several years. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. Thank you. Brian Moynihan : Okay. I think that's all our questions, operator. So, let me just close by saying, as I said earlier, the number 1 point to remember is the organic growth engine that we had before the pandemic is fully back in gear and driving. We've had good expense discipline. We continue -- we're now up to two quarters of operating leverage and we're working towards driving our streak again. The client activity across the board was strong, loan growth, deposit growth, net new households of wealth management, commercial GTS fees, capital markets activity, investment banking activity. And so, those investments across the last several years continue to drive our strong growth in core market share. And in the end of the day, last year was a record year of earnings, and we returned $32 billion of capital to you, our shareholders. Thank you for your support. And we look forward to talking to you next time. Operator : This does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time, and have a wonderful day.",

Later, you will have an opportunity to ask questions during the question-and-answer session.  Please note, this call may be recorded. It is now my pleasure to turn today's program over to Lee McEntire. Lee McEntire : Good morning. Thank you, Katherine. Welcome. I hope everybody had a nice weekend, and thank you for joining the call to review the first quarter results. I trust everybody\u2019s had a chance to review our earnings release documents. As always, they are available, including the earnings presentation that we'll be referring to during this call, on our Investor Relations section of the bankofamerica.com website. I'm going to first turn the call over to our CEO, Brian Moynihan, for some opening comments; and then ask Alastair Borthwick, our CFO, to cover the details of the quarter. Before I turn the call over to Brian, just let me remind you that we may make forward-looking statements and refer to non-GAAP financial measures during the call. These forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and the assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to materially differ from expectations are detailed in our earnings materials and our SEC filings that are available on the website. Information about non-GAAP financial measures, including reconciliations to US GAAP, can also be found in the earnings materials that are available on the website. So with that, take it away, Brian. Brian Moynihan : Thank you, Lee, and good morning to all of you, and thank you for joining us. As we open our earnings call this quarter, we want to acknowledge that there's -- the humanitarian crisis continue to take place in Ukraine and remain watchful and have provided assistance from our company to the Ukranian citizens and staying ready to help further where we can. Before we get into some discussion on the current outlook and activity, I want to step back and focus on the big picture about Bank of America this quarter. In a quarter that had a lot of variables show up, we delivered responsible growth again. We reported $7.1 billion in net income or $0.80 per diluted share. We grew revenue, we reduced costs, and we delivered our third straight quarter of operating leverage coming out of pandemic. Net interest income grew 13% and is expected to grow significantly from here. We saw a strong loan growth. We grew deposits. We saw a strong investment flows. We made trading profits every day during the quarter. We grew pretax pre-provision income by 8%. We had a return on tangible common equity of 15.5%. All this came in that quarter that saw geopolitical conflict, rising interest rates, a pandemic, rising inflation concerns and much, much more. I want to thank our team for delivering on responsible growth once again. So if you look at the statistics on slide two, you can see some of those highlights. You can see the organic growth engine that our company is delivering once again. In our banking business, you can see the strong loan and deposit growth. We grew and expanded customer relationships across every business. In fact, we grew net new checking accounts by more than 220,000 this quarter alone. We opened new financial centers, and we renovated many others. We added more digital capabilities and crossed 50% in digital sales. In our Wealth Management businesses, you can see over $160 billion of client flows over the year and more than $4 trillion in client balances, including Merrill Edge. We saw both strong investment flow performance in addition to banking flows. Over the past year, we brought on a significant number of net new households, 24,000 in Merrill; and then the 2,000 in the private bank. Across the combination of our Consumer and Wealth businesses, we saw more than $90 billion of investment flows. We now have managed client balances, including deposits loan investments of more than $5 trillion with us. In Global Markets, Jim DeMare and his team had a solid quarter of sales and trading results, which included a record quarter for equities. Despite the market turmoil, we had zero days of trading losses. And while the investment banking fee line was down from the record quarters of the past year, Matthew Koder and his team produced solid results with a strong forward pipeline, and we gained market share in several areas, including moving to number two in the mid-cap investment banking. From a broader enterprise perspective, part of managing costs while it comes from the drive we have in the company to provide enhanced digital capabilities to our customers, which in turn drives adoption for the digital engagement and lower costs. If you look at Slide 23 and beyond, you can see we are now selling more digitally than we are in person. It takes both to be successful. What makes them even more impressive is all the financial centers are now open and back to operating at their usual great capacity. So adding the digital capacity clearly increases our total production capabilities. You can also see our digital sales are now twice the pre-pandemic level just three years ago. Even more impressive, look at Zelle and Erica volumes, up more than four times in pre-pandemic levels. We're now processing more outgoing Zelle transactions than checks. In our cash pro mobile app with our commercial clients, we see many $5 billion usage days. There are a lot more stats on the slide showing strong digital growth. I commend to you to see how a high touch, hi-tech innovative company drives organic growth. This quarter, our resilience was tested. And once again, we maintained a focus on what we control and grew responsibly, earned our way through the turmoil. So as we talked to you during the quarter, many of you expressed questions about the impact of the macro environment and changes in our company. So the lingering impact of the pandemic on supply chains and business opportunity, inflation and Fed reduction of monetary combination, the impacts of Russian-Ukraine war, both on the first order effect and second order effects. We do remain mindful of all these. So could a slowdown in the economy happen? Perhaps. But right now, the size of the economy is bigger than pre-pandemic levels. Consumer spending remains strong, unemployment is low and wages are rising. Company earnings are also generally strong. Credit is widely available. And our customers' usage of their lines of credit is still low, i.e., they have capacity to borrow more. We are all focused on the ability of Fed to use their tools to reduce inflation. We know that will take interest rates with rate hikes and a reduction in the balance sheet. We predict it will slow the economy from 3% growth in 2022 to a little below 2% in 2024 \u2013 2023, excuse me. That is back to trend. So the interest rate hikes comes better NII. Could the Fed had to push harder to sell inflation? Perhaps. That is why we run stress test each quarters to look at scenarios to see what would happen in a highly inflationary environment. If rates been put fast though by the implication of capital? For sure, as you saw some in this quarter. But in the context of the capital build, those impacts are manageable. The impact increases earnings also. And then over time, the bonds pull back to par. All that results in a rebuild of the capital quite quickly. But for some short period of time, that capital usage, along with customer usage, might slow share repurchase a little bit, but it will be temporary. What if we're wrong and things do get tougher? We already know what that looks like in 2020, as we built significant reserves, we also built 90 basis points of capital during the economic shutdown period. Rates moved against us and earnings fell. So we have already proven resilient. We continue to focus on responsive growth and things we control. If you go to slide three, I want to mention to show some of the strengths we see in our US consumer base. Bank of America consumers spent at the highest-ever quarter one level, which is a double-digit percentage increase over the 2021 level that you can see in the upper left. From our card spend to date, we have seen a strong recovery in travel, entertain, restaurant spending. In the upper right, you can see that. By the way, even with the fuel costs up 40% and more from last year, fuel represents about 6% of overall debit and credit card spending and a lot less of overall spending as car as you can see in the lower left is 21% of all spending. Importantly, despite March of last year, including stimulus bonus, we saw the spending in the month of March 2022 on a comparable basis to 2021, 13% higher by dollar volume and we saw a 7.4% increase in the number of transactions. So, both dollar volumes and numbers of transactions rose nicely. And as you expect, the message by which people spend continues to shift away from cash and checks to replace with digital alternatives. And you can see that follow. Our data showed continued growth in the average deposit balance across all customer levels, which suggests capacity for strong spending continue. On an aggregated basis, average deposit balances were up 47% from pre-pandemic levels and 15% higher than 2021. And the momentum continued through quarter one, particularly in the low balance accounts, which grew in February to March, continuing a streak since mid-last year. Now a couple of examples so you can see how this works. We looked at the pre-pandemic customers who had $1,000 to $2,000 of clear balances BAC. Today, we have a -- at that time, pre-pandemic had an average balance of 1.4 -- or $1,400. You take that same cohort of customers with -- the same customers in 2022 versus 2019, and they have an average clear balance of now of $7,400. So, they increased from $1,400 to $7,400. If you go to the next cohort up, those with $2,000 to $5,000 of cleared balances in the pre-pandemic, their average was $3,250. Now those same customers today have an average cleared balance of $12,500. What does that tell us? The consumers are sitting on lots of cash. Why this is true while you know, high wage growth, high savings by limited enabled spending. But what it means is a long tail to consumer spend growth. And in April through the first two spending is growing and as fast at 18% over April 2021. Another economic sign posted a continuation of loan growth. A year ago, we highlighted the green shoots of our loan growth. We then delivered a growth in quarter two and quarter three and quarter four despite PPP runoff and the change in economic conditions. To convey where we are today, we focus on ending loans to give you a progression through the quarter. If you go to slide four, you can see the highlights of that growth in the upper left of the slide. I would remind you that in quarter four, we highlighted to you that of the $55 billion of growth in that single quarter, $16 billion was Global Markets. So, we did not expect that to hold true for quarter one of 2022. So as we thought, Global Markets did come down $5 billion this quarter. Despite that, overall commercial loans grew $13 billion from quarter four, excluding PPP. That means commercial loans, excluding Global Markets, grew $17 billion. Every single customer group, global banking, large corporate, middle market, business banking crew as well as commercial loans and Wealth Management. That improvement came from both new loans as well as improving utilization rates from existing clients. You can see in the top chart, loans have moved back above our pre-pandemic levels on the right-hand side of the slide, and you can see it being led by commercial. Consumer loans continue to grow late quarter as well. This is despite typical seasonality and despite the continued suppressed credit card balance, as you can see on the lower left. Mortgage loans grew $4 billion, originations remained at high levels, and paydowns declined. Card loans declined $2 billion from quarter four, driven by the transfer of $1.6 billion affinity card loan portfolio to the held for sale category, absent that transfer, card loans would have declined very modestly, whereas, the previous quarter -- one quarter, they declined several billion. On slide 5, we provide data around consumer clients' leverage and asset quality as compared to pre-pandemic periods, which further supports our belief that consumers remain in good shape. On the upper left, we looked at our customers that have both a credit card and a deposit account with us. As you will note, the average card balance of our credit card customers that had deposit relationships are still 8% lower than they were pre-pandemic. They continue to pay down their balances on a monthly basis at a higher rate than pre-pandemic. And as you know, delinquency rates are significantly lower. Further, as you can see in my earlier point, these borrowing customers have built significant additional savings, and their average deposit balances were up 39%. So a lot of strength or dry powder is its goal. So what if we went to the modest FICO as more modest amount of low FICO customers you have at BAC. Looking at that small subset of our base, you can see a similar trend, even stronger on cash balances and lower debt levels. And you see in the bottom charts, we believe this is not just a phenomena at BAC as industry data points around debt service levels are hovering near historic lows and household deposit and cash levels are $3 trillion higher than we entered the crisis. Now a word on Russia. This is not an area of material direct exposure for Bank of America. More than a decade ago, we've reduced our exposure in Russia, and it's result in having 90% less before the most recent crisis. Our current very limited activities in Russia are focused on compliance with all sanctions and other legal and regulatory requirements. Our lending and counterparty exposure to companies based in Russia totals approximately $700 million and is limited to nine Russian-based borrowers. It's largely comprised of top-tier commodity exporters with a history of strong cash flows who continue to make payments. Prior to the Ukrainian invasion, these exposure were mostly investment grade, we report all of them on our reservable criticized. Our quarter one allowance includes increased reserves from this direct exposure. And I just note that even with the addition of these loans to reservable criticized, we still declined $1.7 billion in this category during the first quarter. We continue our daily monitoring with sanctions and interest payments might impact these loans. We also evaluate our portfolios and continue to do so considering second order impact to this crisis. Currently, we believe this to be modest and reflect our international strategy to focus on large multinational clients that have geographically diverse operations. Our quarter one allowance for credit losses reflects all of these things as well. On Russian counterparty risk, our teams have done a tremendous job from ending down our exposures. And at the end of the quarter, we have de minimis, meaning less than $20 million counterbalance exposures with a single Russian based counterparty. And very limited impacts from quarter -- and any of those impacts are in our trading results for this quarter. So responsible growth has served us well here. And as you might note, after the 2014 Crimea conflict, we intentionally reduced our exposure. And Russia has not been our top 20 country risk exposure table since 2015. So a few comments on NII. On NII, remember the rate increases came late in the quarter and had little first quarter 2022 NII impact. And there were two fewer days of interest in the quarter and decreased PPP fees hurt NII growth, yet we still grew NII by $200 million in-line with our guidance we gave you last quarter. Given the forward curve expectation for higher interest rates and our expectations of further loan growth, we expect significant NII improvement through the next several quarters. Alistair will expand on this point for you. We have more than $2 trillion of deposits and $1.4 trillion of those are with our consumer wealth management clients with more than 40% of those and low to no interest checking. That is a franchise that isn't rivaled. We will benefit as the rates move off to 04s allowing us to earn more money on those check and deposits.  Deposits, I know some -- several of you are wondering if deposits can continue to grow as rates begin to rise. So, we went back and looked at the last rising cycle in the last decade. We pinpointed the peak rate paid to customers during the quarter reflected of this peak Fed tightening. We then went back and looked at the 12 months preceding growth rate in deposits. And in fact, during that 12 months preceding that peak, deposits grew 5%, driven by organic growth engine, our market share gains and overall economic growth.  If we go to Page \u2013 Slide 6, you can see that comment -- where we talked about capital. Just to start off, our capital remained strong with 10.4% CET1 ratio well above our 9.5% minimum requirement. As you can see $7 billion of earnings, net of preferred dividends, generated 41 basis points of capital. If you look on the right-hand side of the page, you can see that 14 basis points of that capital was used to support our customers' growth, that's a good thing. We also returned $4 billion to shareholders in common dividends and share repurchase, will represent about 27 basis points of use.  Despite the treasury and mortgage-backed securities rates caused the fair value of our AFS debt securities to decrease and lowered our CET1 by 21 basis points. That's the part that goes through the calculation of the capital. While one wouldn't expect this impact every quarter, we're well positioned -- we were well positioned for the spike. As you recall, we invested much of our securities books and held to maturity due to our huge excess and stable deposit base. We have $2 trillion of deposits and less than $1 trillion in loans.  In addition to be cautious, we hedge a large portion of securities in the AFS portfolio, protecting it from a much larger hit to AOCI. I remind you, as the securities mature, the AOCI reverses and higher rates result in higher NII over a relatively short period of time. That should result in higher earnings that will benefit CET1 ratios on an ongoing basis and more than offset the negative upfront AOCI impact.  Last thing I would note is our balance sheet growth to support our customer means our GSIB buffer will probably move higher by 50 basis points beginning in 2024, i.e., to 10% regulatory minimums. Well, this is nearly two years away, we continue to move towards it. Given this new higher minimum over the next couple of years, we'll look to gradually move to target CET1 range of 10.75% towards 11%. Importantly, while we grow into this range, we'll be able to support our clients, we'll be able to continue to increase our dividend, and we'll be able to continue to buyback stock. With that, let me turn it over to Alastair. Alastair Borthwick : Thank you, Brian, and I'll start with the summary income statement on Slide 7, where you can see our comparisons illustrating 3% year-over-year operating leverage produced by growing revenue and managing our costs well. That was nearly enough to overcome the change in provision expense, driven by the $2.7 billion reserve release in the year-ago period compared to a $400 million released this quarter. On asset quality, more broadly, we continue to see very strong metrics. Net charge-offs remained low, and in fact, they're down more than 50% in just the past year. Consumer early and late-stage delinquencies are still below 2019 levels, and reservable criticized moved lower again in Q1. Looking ahead, we continue to feel good about the asset quality results of our consumer and commercial businesses near term, given our customers' high liquidity, low unemployment and rising wages. We produced good returns again this quarter with an ROTCE of nearly 16%, and we delivered $4.4 billion of capital back to shareholders, driving average shares lower by 6% year-over-year. Looking forward and with continued expectations of growing NII, combined with strong expense control, we expect to drive operating leverage and see our efficiency ratio work back towards 60%. So let's turn to slide eight and the balance sheet. And you can see during the quarter, our balance sheet grew $69 billion to a little more than $3.2 trillion. This reflected $14 billion of growth in loans and the growth of our Global Markets balance sheet, as customers increased their activity with us. Our decline in cash this quarter was associated bad growth in Global Markets. Our liquidity portfolio was stable compared to year-end. And at $1.1 trillion, it represents roughly a-third of the balance sheet. Shareholders' equity declined $3.4 billion from Q4 with a few different component side of note. Shareholders' equity benefited from net income after preferred dividends of $6.6 billion, as well as issuance of $2.4 billion in preferred stock. So that's $9 billion that flowed into equity in Q1. And we paid out $4.4 billion in common dividends and share repurchases. AOCI declined as a result of the spike in loan rates that Brian referenced, and we saw the impact in two waves. First, we had a reduction from a change in the value of our AFS debt securities, that was $3.4 billion. That's the piece that impacts CET1, as Brian noted. And second, rates also drove a $5.2 billion decline in AOCI from derivatives, but does not impact CET1. That reflects cash flow hedges against our variable rate ones, which provides some NII growth and protected CET1 at the same time. With regard to regulatory capital, since Brian already talked about CET1, I'd simply note that our supplemental leverage ratio was stable at 5.4% versus the minimum requirement of 5%, and still leaves us plenty of capacity for balance sheet growth. And our TLAC ratio remains comfortably above our requirements. Turning to slide nine, we included the schedule on average loan balances. And in the interest of time, the only thing I would add to Brian's earlier comments, and for your perspective, is simply a reminder that PPP loans are down $19 billion year-over-year. There's just a few billion of those left. And excluding PPP, our total loans grew $89 billion or 10% compared to last year. Moving to deposits on Slide 10. First, let's look at year-over-year growth. And across the past 12 months, we saw solid growth across the client base as we deepened relationships and added net new accounts. Our year-over-year average deposits are up $240 billion or 13%. Retail deposits with our Consumer and Wealth Management businesses grew $190 million, and our retail deposits have now grown to more than $1.4 trillion, where we lead all competitors. Looking at linked-quarter growth from Q4 and combining Consumer and Wealth Management customer balances, our retail deposits grew $53 billion in just the past 90 days. With our commercial clients, they're up nicely year-over-year, and we simply note the Q1 decline, which is entirely consistent with previous year's seasonal trends. Turning to Slide 11 and net interest income. On a GAAP non-FTE basis, NII in Q1 was $11.6 billion. And the FTE NII number was $11.7 billion. So I'll focus on FTE, where net interest income has now increased $1.4 billion from the first quarter last year. As Brian noted, that's 13% increase driven by deposits growth and our related investment of liquidity. NII was up $200 million versus the fourth quarter as the benefits of lower premium amortization and loans growth more than offset the headwinds of two less days of interest accruals and lower PPP fees. So let's pause for a moment to discuss asset sensitivity because I want to make a couple of points as we begin what the Fed has said well to be a significant rate hike period. Remember, asset sensitivity is our measure of NII for the next 12 months above an expected baseline of NII, given changes in interest rates and other assumptions. In an environment of sharply rising rates each quarter, the baseline of NII -- actual NII increases and, therefore, the future sensitivity declines. Now we typically disclose our asset sensitivity based on a 100 basis point instantaneous parallel shock in rates above the forward curve. And on that basis, asset sensitivity at March 31 was $5.4 billion of expected NII over the next 12 months, and 90% of that sensitivity is driven by short rates. That $5.4 billion is down from $6.5 billion at year-end, largely because higher rates are now factored into and running through our actual or baseline NII. Well, you asked the question last quarter about the same sensitivity on a spot basis relative to our current curve. And given that the yield curve is projecting 125 basis points of rate hikes over the next three meetings, we thought it was appropriate to provide that disclosure. So in a 100 basis point shock to the current curve using spot rates, our sensitivity to that kind of move would be $6.8 billion or $1.4 billion higher than on a forward basis. So assuming rising rates as reflected in today's forward curve and if we see continued loans growth, I would just reiterate what we said last quarter that we expect to see robust NII growth in 2022 compared to 2021. We're not going to provide numerical guidance for the full year because the changes in interest rates have proven quite volatile in just the last 90 days, let alone a year. We do provide that asset sensitivity so that you can use it as guardrails to think about changes as you modify your own assumptions. I do, however, want to provide a near-term expectation and say that if loans grow and rates in the forward curve materialize, we would expect to see NII in Q2 increase by more than $650 million over the Q1 level and then grow again significantly on a sequential basis in each of the following two quarters. Okay. Let's turn to expenses, and we'll use slide 12 for that discussion. Our Q1 expenses were $15.3 billion, down a couple hundred million from the year-ago period. I'll focus my remarks on the more recent comparison versus Q4 where we're up $600 million. And as expected, and we conveyed to you last quarter, the Q1 increase was driven mostly by seasonality of payroll tax expense or roughly $400 million. We also experienced modestly higher wage and benefit costs. As we look forward, we continue to invest heavily in technology, people, and marketing across our lines of business, and we've continued to add new financial centers in expansion and growth markets. We modestly increased our full year new tech initiative budget for the year to $3.6 billion. And that's on top of -- that's on top of more than $35 billion that we put to work over the past 12 years to help us build powerful, more secure, and scalable technology platforms. This is the investment that allowed us to maintain a leadership position in patents among our peers. We had 512 of them granted in 2021 and we're maintaining in a similar pace this year. We think this is one of the things that's happened to protect our moat around leadership positions in places that matter most to customers. In addition to modestly higher marketing costs this year, our investments also include adding up to 100 new financial centers. And we also plan to renovate more than 800 more during the year. We will also continue our upward march on minimum hourly wage toward $25 by 2025. So, how do we pay for all that? Through continued work on operational excellence and digital engagement. And as we look to Q2, we expect our expenses to be down modestly from Q1, as much of the seasonal payroll tax expense abates and is somewhat offset by investment timing, inflation, and the cost of opening up more fully for travel and clone entertainment. Because it feels like we've got a lot of pent-up demand for face-to-face meetings by our clients and our people. So, let's turn to asset quality on slide 13. And as you can see, asset quality of our customers remains very healthy. Net charge-offs this quarter were better than our expectations once again and remained below $400 million, down 52% compared to Q1 2021. Provision expense was $30 million in Q1 as reserve release of $362 million closely matched net charge-offs in the quarter. And that reserve release was primarily in our consumer portfolios. On slide 14, we highlight the credit quality metrics for both our consumer and commercial portfolios, and I am happy to answer any questions later, but a couple of things are worth repeating. Consumer delinquencies remain well below pre-pandemic levels. And despite reporting our commercial Russian lending exposure in reservable criticized, those levels still declined $1.7 billion from Q4. NPI saw modest increase and that simply reflects a small amount of consumer real estate deferrals expiring with the expiration of the CARES Act. Turning to the business segments. One thing we'd ask you just to keep in mind for each of the businesses is Q1 expense includes the seasonal payroll tax expense, which has negatively impacted efficiency ratios or profit margins in Q1. Also, and as usual, Q1 of every year includes segment capital level evaluation. And you'll note, we put additional capital against each of the businesses due to their growth. And as usual, we've tried to include business trends and digital stats for each segment. So let's start with Consumer Banking on slide 15, where you can see the Consumer Bank earned nearly $3 billion. That's 11% up over Q1 2021 as revenue growth more than offset the larger prior period reserve release. It's probably most easily identified by looking at pre-tax pre-provision earnings, which grew 32% year-over-year. Revenue grew 9% on NII improvement, and expense declined 4%, creating 13% operating leverage and the fourth consecutive quarter of operating leverage for our Consumer team. Notable customer activity highlights included our 228,000 net new checking accounts opened in Q1, which represents our 13th consecutive quarter of net new consumer checking account growth. Now this occurred as we began to implement our previously announced insufficient funds and overdraft policy changes, which lowered our service charges about $80 million. So during this time, we saw accounts grow and we saw expenses decline. We also grew investment accounts 7%, and we saw those balances grow 10% from Q1 '21 to $350 billion, and that included $20 billion of client flows. And once again, we opened nearly one million credit cards in the quarter and grew average active card accounts and saw growth in combined credit and debit spend of 15%. Our continued investment in digital capabilities drove activity with our customers as we crossed 50% in digital sales this quarter and we continued investment in our financial centers, opening another eight in the quarter. It's also worth noting that small business saw continued growth in loans, in deposits and in spending. Small business card spend was up 28% year-over-year. It gives you an idea of how small businesses are reopening for business. I'd also draw your attention to slide 22 in the appendix. We've shared this with you previously, and it simply highlights the origination strength and quality of our consumer underwriting. Throughout everything, our underwriting standards have remained consistent. Moving to slide 16. Wealth Management produced strong results earning $1.1 billion, and that represented 28% year-over-year growth, driven by strong revenue improvement, good expense management and low credit costs. Bank of America continues to deliver Wealth Management at scale across a full range of our client segments and with the best advisers in the industry according to Barron's rankings. That, coupled with our digital leadership, is delivering a modern Merrill and a modern Private Bank for clients through enterprise relationships and our clients and advisors have recognized the value in a holistic financial relationship that extends across investments, planning and banking. And that's what helped drive the $150 billion of clients' balance flows that you see here over the past 12 months.  Not only did we see strong investment flows of more than $70 billion, but deposits grew $59 billion, up 18%, and we added $22 billion in loans over the same period, marking our 48th consecutive quarter of average loans growth in the business, just consistent and sustained performance from the team. Revenues grew 10% to a new record and were led by 25% growth in NII on the back of those solid deposit and loans increases, as well as a 9% improvement in asset management fees. Expenses increased 4%, driven by higher revenue-related costs and resulted in over 600 basis points of operating leverage. And we generated nearly 7,000 in net new households in Merrill and more than 800 in the private bank this quarter. Moving to Global Banking on Slide 17. The business momentum with our Commercial clients remained strong in the first quarter. The business earned $1.7 billion in Q1, down $450 million year-over-year, driven by the absence of a large prior period reserve release and lower investment banking revenue. Revenue improvement of 12% year-over-year reflected higher leasing-related revenue and NII growth, partially offset by those lower investment banking fees. Net interest income grew on the back of strong loans and deposits growth. And the leasing revenue improvement included more ESG-related investments, particularly in solar, as well as the absence of weather-related losses recorded last year. While the company's overall investment banking fees of $1.5 billion declined 35% year-over-year, we gained market share in some important areas and recorded a number three ranking in overall fees. And importantly, our investment banking pipeline remains quite healthy.  Provision expense reflected a reserve build of $177 million compared to a $1.2 billion release in the year-ago period, and this quarter's provision includes reserves taken for Russia exposure and other considerations for loans growth, offset by continued improvement in asset quality metrics. Finally, we saw expense decline by 4%, driving strong operating leverage.  Switching to Global Markets on Slide 18 and as we usually do, I will talk about the segment results, excluding DVA. Q1 net income of $1.5 billion reflects a solid quarter of sales and trading revenue and it includes a new record for equities. The business generated a 15% return in Q1 even with a 12% increase in the capital allocated to the business.  Our investments in this business saw good results as our financing clients continue to increase their activities with our company. Focusing on year-over-year, sales and trading contributed $4.7 billion to revenue. Versus Q4, that was a 58% improvement, a little higher than typical seasonality. And versus Q1 '21, we saw a decline of 8% as the prior year included higher commodities results due to weather-related events. FICC declined 19%, while equities improved 9%. That FICC decline reflects the higher prior period commodities and a weaker credit trading environment. And it was partially offset by improved performance across our macro products, especially rates and foreign exchange. The strength in equities was driven by strong performance in derivatives. And year-over-year expense declined, reflecting the absence of costs associated with the realignment of a liquidating business activity to the all other unit, as well as some Q1 2021 accelerated cost for incentive changes. Absent those impacts, expenses were up modestly. Finally, on slide 19, we show all other, which reported a loss of $364 million, declining $620 million from the year-ago period. Revenue declined as a result of higher volume of deals, particularly solar, and therefore, higher partnership losses on ESG investments, and this is partially offset by the tax impact in this reporting unit. Expense increased as a result of costs now recorded here in this segment, following the Q4 realignment of that liquidating business out of Global Markets. And as a reminder, for the financial statement presentation in this release, the business segments are all taxed on a standard fully taxable equivalent basis. So in all other, we incorporate the impact of our ESG tax rates and any other unusual items. For the quarter for the company, our effective tax rate was 10%, benefiting from ESG investment tax credits. And excluding the tax credits, the tax rate would have been roughly 24%. We expect our effective tax rate in 2022 to be between 10% to 12%, absent any tax law changes or any unusual items. And with that, let's open it up, please, for Q&A. Operator :  We'll go first to Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Your line is open. Glenn Schorr : Hi. Thanks very much. And forgive me if this is a drop long. But, I listen to all your comments about the consumer, about spending, about no real stresses in credit, net charge-offs nonperforming, debt service levels, all that sounds great. And in the past, I think higher rates were designed to pull leverage from the system and call some recessions. And so, the market is trying to assign some percentage chance towards a recession, yet every comment I hear out of your mouth doesn't sound like we're going towards a recession. So I wanted to see if I could, A, get you to comment on your thoughts around today's environment versus history? And then, also, specifically ask what you did with the ins and outs in reserves? And if you changed any macro scenarios as you bake in CECL results? Thanks for that. Thanks for bearing with me. Alastair Borthwick : Thanks, Glenn. So you're right to pick up on the commentary, because Brian's highlighted the strength of the consumer, which remains extraordinary. And at the same time, what we see on the asset quality side of commercial is just continued steady improvement as the economy reopens. So that's what we're seeing. That's contemporaneous. Now, you're asking a question about, what does it look like in the future? And we're obviously aware of what the Fed is trying to engineer. So going through this every quarter, as we always do, we have an opportunity to think about how we look at our reserves. And this quarter, we took some of the upside height. We've got a little more weighting towards a baseline and a little more towards downside. So that's one thing we've done. Second thing we've done is we've upped our forecast for inflation. So we see that playing through. And those scenarios are a little more weighted towards inflationary. And third, we have adjusted GDP growth done, largely based on blue-chip consensus. So we, like you, are looking at two things. Number one, we're looking at what we're seeing in the actual results. And number two, we're thinking about how we balance that going forward with our scenarios. Brian Moynihan : Glenn, I think just generally, Fed has a task to bringing inflation out of the system. And our GDP assumptions, like  partner team, they are for the economy, the slowest growth rate from this year to next year. The question of great debate is a soft lining, hard lining, et cetera. But I think what's unusual this time is how much cash is sitting in the consumers' accounts. If you are sitting here when they start normalizing rates in the middle of the last decade, late to middle last decade, you wouldn't have seen the consumer balances sitting with those multiples I gave you earlier in their accounts and then having tremendous borrowing capacity left in terms of unused credit lines and the same on the commercial side Lines are bouncing along just above the low point. And so we continue to adjust our reserve levels to, as Alastair said, to factor in our base case includes higher inflation through the rest of the year. And next year, our seats reserves, set by that base case, which is a 40% weighting to adverse, frankly equal maybe 40% of the actual reserves we have, because the rest are judgmental and in precision and things like that. So we're very strong in reserve. And we're very mindful that I think it's very different to think about the situation where the consumers unemployment is already so low and the consumers are sitting with money. And I think that puts more attention on the Fed to how they architect a successful change, and they know that. But on the other hand, it's a better place to start. Glenn Schorr : I appreciate all that. One little tiny follow-up is in Global Banking, I noticed $2 billion more allocated capital. Deal activity is down, but you mentioned pipelines are good. So maybe you could just talk about just what's going on there. Thank you. Alastair Borthwick : Well, we don't have a great deal to add there. Obviously, we're coming off of record quarters last year. And we're just operating in the market conditions that were given. The volatility has obviously been hardest felt in equity capital markets and in high yield. And across the board, we'd say our pipelines look very strong. So I think when I asked Matthew, he said somewhere between strong and very strong. So I should tell you everything you need to know. But obviously, we need market conditions to cooperate. Glenn Schorr : Okay. Thanks so much. Operator : Our next question comes from John McDonald with Autonomous Research. Your line is open. John McDonald : Hi, good morning. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about expenses and operating leverage. Are you still thinking that expenses will be flattish this year in the $60 billion ballpark, Brian? And you did mention expectations for the efficiency ratio as our operating leverage improves with NII, maybe that marches down from kind of the mid-60s to low 60s, I think you said? Brian Moynihan : Yes. And Alastair gave you some detail. But just simply put, John, we expect to be relatively flat for 2022 versus 2021. That's the guidance we gave you last quarter. We don't see any different this quarter. John McDonald : Okay, that's helpful. And then, Alastair, maybe just a little more fleshing out about the capital and how you're managing the CET1. Obviously, you're generating already capital each quarter above what you're paying out the dividend. It seemed like 30 basis points this quarter, and that probably gets better. At the same time, it sounds like you may be going to manage up to around 11 over the next year. Maybe you could just give us some of the dynamics there and how that plays into the ability to do some buybacks through the rest of the year? Thanks. Alastair Borthwick : Yes. So, no change to our approach, John, relative to prior years. I think the waterfall that we laid out on slide six is pretty constructive. First priority for us will remain just invest in growth. We'll support our clients and let them get after -- and the teams get after the loans to help our clients there. Secondly, we'll make the dividend payments. And then we'll have capital left over for share buyback as we have had in the past. And we'll make those decisions in the context of future rate environments and future capital requirements. I think Brian pointed out to you that we're going to build capital over the course of the next couple of years by about 50 basis points. We've got seven quarters. So, it's a small amount every quarter that we'll be doing. Brian Moynihan : And John, just you said operating leverage. I'm proud of the team. We have three straight quarters of operating leverage. PPNR growth was strong. That's different than what we've seen out there generally. But remember, during the -- as the rates rose in the pre-pandemic softening and hard landing and inherently ways in everybody's mind, the simple fact is we had 20 straight quarters of operating leverage, and we're starting to see that come through. And if you look at the consumer efficiency from the first quarter last year, this quarter, your point in efficiency ratio, this has all come through NII and it all falls to the bottom-line. And therefore, you end up with a fairly significant impact in those businesses, which are obviously highly sensitive growth in NII. John McDonald : Got it. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open. Mike Mayo : Hi. Brian and Alastair, I wonder if you can just make a distinction tree in the economic, regulatory and accounting outlook. So, from the economic standpoint, your mark-to-market, your assets and your securities, you saw a swing to AOCI, but you don't mark-to-market that $1.4 billion of deposits. From a regulatory standpoint, AOCI causes you to slow buybacks, I believe, you said. but from an accounting or earnings standpoint, maybe you win in the end, maybe you don't. So, I know you're not giving specific guidance for NII. But just at a basic level, if your guide's earnings outlook better because of the NII and the higher payment rates and the better efficiency, or is it worse because you have less buybacks, maybe more provisions due to the potential for a recession? Brian Moynihan : Mike, those are all the pieces. But simply put, I think Alastair said, NII pick up next quarter. So you pick up the $200 million this quarter, you put that in the bank, then you pick up another $600 million plus next quarter and then it grows with net out. So yes, that's tremendous operating leverage. And as we just said to John, expenses are flat. So that flows through the bottom line. All the different vagaries of not only regulatory accounting versus GAAP accounting, but also what cap, the comp and the capital ratio calculation versus not, at the end of the day, you said $1.4 trillion. It's $2 trillion of deposits, $1.4 trillion just on the consumer -- for people side of the business. And even on the business side, we only have operational deposits. And so the end of the day, those are very long deposits. We extract the value through investing, and that's why we put it in held the maturity. And the cash flow of that head to maturity portfolio is $20-odd billion a quarter even in a rate environment changes. So that -- whatever hit we had, the CET1, the growth in NII and the growth in earnings power and hat covers up inside of a year. And so we feel very good about that. So the rate environment where we come off the zero floors makes us a lot more money. You know that, and we know that. Mike Mayo : Can you elaborate a little bit more on what you mean by operational deposits? I know you've talked about that and the linkages, and I guess that's the reason why you would expect deposits to be more sticky. But can you elaborate a little bit more? You mentioned that Zelle and Erica volumes are up four times higher than pre-pandemic. So I guess you have a little bit more lock-in, but if you could elaborate more? Brian Moynihan : On the consumer side, the people being Wealth Management consumers and general consumers, the $1.4 trillion were 40% or more in checking accounts, and that's the money people have in motion in a given day. And what the big volume of comes from, frankly, you have 35 million checking holders, which is a new record for us. And so that's important. And all the feature functionality helps them our retention for our preferred customer base and the consumer segment, which represents 70% or 80% of all the deposits is 99-point something. And so those customers stay with us a long time. What I meant operational accounts on the commercial side, we -- all the cash is money in motion for those commercial customers, meaning it's part of the data cash flow. So whether it's small business customers, whether it's business banking customers, which are under $50 million revenue companies or even middle market, this money is coming in and out every day. And so it's very stable. It doesn't disappear from the scenes. And if you look at our GTS revenue, you can see the Global Transaction Services revenue on the -- page on Gold Banking, you'll see it's grown nicely year-over-year, and that's due to the stability of that deposit base and what we see. So it's not going to move away from the balance sheet. That's the point I said about -- in a rate rising cycle, last rate rising cycle, as money supply shrink, at the end of the day, we grew deposits 5%. And so we'll see what happens because it's different, but we feel pretty confident. Mike Mayo : All right. Thank you. Alastair Borthwick : Mike, the only the other thing I'd add is when Brian talks about operating, it's one of the reasons we highlight that 92%, 93% of our consumer accounts are primary. And we've had 99% plus retention rate on those accounts. So these are sticky deposits. That's what we're just trying to make sure everyone understands. Mike Mayo : All right. Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Betsy Graseck : Hey, thanks. Good morning. Two questions. One on expenses, I know you mentioned this year that you're still anticipating relatively flat and that you would deal with inflation pressures, et cetera, from some of the opportunities you have to get more efficient. Can you give us a sense as to how long you think you can stay flat for? Like is that going to be into 2023 as well? And can you unpack some of the things you're doing to get more efficient? I know you did a ton of efficiency pre-COVID, so what's left? Thanks. Brian Moynihan : So Betsy remember, coming into the pandemic we had hit the point where we brought expenses down and said we \u2013 now we're an operating leverage company, so we'll get revenue growth faster than expense growth, but we'd start to grow modestly. Then the pandemic had a lot of expenses coming in and out. But \u2013 and so when we say flat year-over-year, basically meaning '23 versus '22 in that $59 billion to $60 billion range, our view is that our goal is to keep that down to a modest expense growth, if any, and as we move to '24, etcetera. but we are fighting all those discussion you had. But the key is to have the revenue grow much faster. And that's what we expect to see as NII kicks back up and efficiency ratios as Mike or John referenced, ought to kick back down pretty nicely. Betsy Graseck : Got it. And then the other question is just further rate backups, obviously 10 years already at 28, it's up 50 bps from March 31 so if it goes to like 33, we have the same kind of hit as this past quarter. Can you just give us a sense as to how you're dealing with that rate back-ups? Is there anything you would do differently? Would you move any AFS to HTM, or would you engage this new accounting rule that's been finalized in March 28 that enables you to do last layer hedging on HTM book? I mean does any of that matter to you? And just give us a sense as to how much longer this rate back up is, or would you change how you're dealing with it? Brian Moynihan : Yes. So, the piece that will matter the most will be the AFS securities. And we've talked before about the fact that we have about 200 billion of treasuries there and they're all swapped to floating precisely to insulate us. So, I think that's one of the reasons you see our AOCI hit is much smaller than many others.  So then it's just a question of managing around the $50 billion or so of securities that we have there that aren't swapped to floating. And I'd just note that, that number has come down a little bit months after months after months. I think it will keep coming down. We have some ability, obviously, to hedge that if we choose to. And so, we'll manage our interest rate exposure as the environment develops from here. Betsy Graseck : Okay. Thanks. Operator : We'll go now to Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Matt O'Connor: Hi. I was hoping to get a little more detail on the net interest income trajectory in the back half of the year, if we follow the forward curve? And I appreciate you don't want to give explicit guidance because maybe a month from now, the rate environment will change, but it's also the key driver for Bank of America's earnings from here and obviously, a very positive story. So, one is again, and maybe I'll start it with last quarter is up more than $600 million. If you follow the forward curve, it seems like that quarter-on-quarter increase could actually accelerate in the back half of the year. So maybe I'll leave it out for you to run those? Alastair Borthwick : Yes. So look, I think we, broadly speaking, agree with you. We obviously don't control rates. So that's why we're always reluctant to give guidance over the course of the next 270 days. But we're very levered to rates going up from here. And we said in our remarks that we believe the second quarter will be up at least $650 million in NII. And I think if you look at the forward curve, yes, you would expect to accelerate over the course of the year. And then, we tried to give you the broad outlines around $5.4 billion versus forward $6.8 billion versus spot, it's obviously very meaningful. But we're only prepared to look out over the course of the next 90 days, because we feel like we've got pretty good confidence around that. And I think the other thing just to bear in mind is, our next meeting is in May. So you'll see like the Fed meetings and the hikes in the forward curve really do accelerate things in the back half of the year. Matt O'Connor: And how do you think, if we do get kind of the second 100 basis point rate increase of the market anticipating, what does that kind of look like in terms of your rate sensitivity? And then, just kind of squeezing similar. At some point, your rate hikes not help net interest income, or it helps, but just to a lesser extent? Thank you. Alastair Borthwick : Well, I think just the fact that you've got $5.4 billion compared to $6.8 billion tells you a little bit about successive rate hikes become less valuable. But we're probably a long way from where they stopped having value. So look, we expect, as Brian talked about, we're kind of at a rate floor when rates are at zero. And obviously, we'll get significant benefit over the course of the next 100 basis points. I, like you, would anticipate less from the following 100. But again, we're going to capture a lot of value, because our strategy is based around operating accounts in commercial and primary accounts in consumer. Brian Moynihan : Yes. The question always is, if the Fed is hiking rates because of inflation that they can't get back under control and you got to look at the stuff out, everybody focused on NII, you got to look at what's going on in the economy generally. So that's why we have significant reserves in case it's harder landing than people at the Fed would like to engineer. And that's why we run the company with such a balance. But generally, a higher sustained rate environment will help us earn a lot more money. And you saw that pick up, as we picked up through 2016, 2017, 2018, and you'll see it happen. Again, you've already seen it happen. Then we think last year first quarter, this year first quarter, we had $1.4 billion more NII per quarter. So that's -- it's already helped and as loan and deposit growth are matched with some modest rate increases. Matt O'Connor: Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Erika Najarian with UBS. Your line is open. Erika Najarian : Hi. Good morning. My first question is a follow-up to what Matt was asking about. Alastair, could you give us a sense of what the deposit repricing assumption is in the plus $6.8 billion in sensitivity for the first 100. And given your focus on primary and operating accounts, contrast that with chunkier rate hikes, how should we expect deposit repricing to behave in the second 100 basis points? Alastair Borthwick : So we normally take a look at our deposit betas over the course of history. And if you go back to the last three out cycle, 2015 through 2019, on average, you can't -- it's obviously very different by account and line of business and client. But on average, it was somewhere between 20% and 25% for Bank of America. We'd hope to perform a lithium battery in this cycle just based on the value we deliver to clients, particularly in things like digital, et cetera. But for now, I think that's a reasonable assumption. It's difficult to project out first 100 versus second 100. I mean I would imagine for the first couple of hundreds, it's going to be pretty -- I would hope, pretty stable. But at some point, when you think deposit basis would drift higher, we'll obviously be able to give you guidance on that in the future based on what we're actually seeing. Erika Najarian : Got it. And I just wanted to clarify something, Brian, that you said to Betsy. Did you say that you expect 2023 expenses to be between $59 billion and $60 billion and then for modest growth to return in 2024? Brian Moynihan : No. We said 2022 is flat to 2021, and then grow modestly then. Erika Najarian : Got it. Okay. Got it. And then the follow-up question there is, you mentioned your trajectory -- your target for getting back to 60% on the efficiency ratio. What kind of time frame are you thinking in terms of when you can accomplish that relative to the forward curve? Brian Moynihan : So I think that -- we made progress each quarter basically. We're around the 66%, we're down year-over-year. I think if I gave you the specific quarter, we crossed over basically to the earnings projection for the rest of the quarter. So Erika, I think just as you look at the businesses, you're starting to see them drop more in line. Obviously, we always have such a huge Wealth Management business, which 27% pre-tax margin which is industry-leading, it was up 30% last quarter, will impact that because it's a bigger part of our business than others, but you'll see relentless progress, but I can't give the exact quarter. Erika Najarian : Got it. And just one last question on capital. So today, your current CET1 minimum is 9.5%. And the higher G-SIB surcharge, when is that -- is that effective by January 1, 2023, so therefore, your minimum goes up by 50 basis points? And Brian, what -- how are you thinking of buffers relative to your new minimums? I think one of your counterparts said that he was no longer thinking of buffers upon buffers as he thinks of capital management going forward. Alastair Borthwick : So Erika, our G-SIB minimum would increase effective January 1, 2024. So we've got seven quarters to build towards that. Brian talked about operating and managing the company 75 to 100 basis points above our regulatory minimum. That's obviously exactly where we are right now. And so over the course of the next seven quarters, we just expect to build that 50 basis points of capital. Erika Najarian : Got it. Thank you. Operator : We'll go now to Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Your line is open. Ken Usdin : Hey, thanks. Good morning. Just wanted to look at the commercial side of loans. Fourth quarter loan growth ex-PPP was great at 10. And this quarter a little slower. Just wanted to ask you about just that end demand question, any supply chain, any interchanges in line utilization? And just what are you seeing out there on the commercial demand side? Thanks. Alastair Borthwick : Well, our clients are definitely seeing supply chain challenges. They're working through admirably. We've also seen inflation, and we're seeing labor and wage pressure. So that, I think we all know. At the same time, the economy is returning more towards normal, and our line utilization is returning more towards normal too. That's a part of what's driving our loans growth. So, revolver utilization in commercial now in banking is 31.7%. Pre-pandemic are normal, was around 35%. So, that's about 3.3%. Figure that's like $15 billion to $20 billion of loans potential as the economy continues to heal and as clients begin to take utilization back. So, it's one of the reasons we're still comfortable with loans growth, and we see the same momentum that we have over the course of the past 12 months. Brian Moynihan : Important in the small business area, originations are strong and back past pre-pandemic levels of quarterly originations and you're seeing home equity come back up even though mortgage will fall off. I think pre-pandemic, we did $3 billion. So, we have a room on the consumer side and on the commercial side for further loan growth as the -- as people sort of normalize their behaviors and activities. And now you all read about the car industry, the line uses a car. Car auto dealers is really low and it's just, as an example, they can't keep enough inventory on the line. Ken Usdin : Got it. And one follow-up on the fee side. I know investment banking and trading are going to be hard to forecast. But just any thoughts on some of the consumer-related and brokers-weighted fee areas? There's been some underlying moving parts there. Just can you talk about just the growth trajectory of some of those fee areas? And I guess, we'll just kind of leave the IB trading, so we'll see what happens in the markets. Brian Moynihan : Yes. Well, I think we're wise to do that. When it comes to the card side, I'd say, flattish. We're managing to the total client relationship there. That remains something that we're focused on total we'll see some growth there. We'll see it in balances. We'll see it in NII mostly, and we'll see it in detail in elsewhere. On the asset management side, mostly it will be around market levels. So, we'll follow that, as you will, closely. And a little bit of net new household growth and flows growth again this year. So, that's how we're thinking about it. But I would say across all kind of flattish slightly, maybe slightly up. The only one thing to bear in mind is just as a reminder, on insufficient funds and overdraft. Just remember that those that started to kick in in February, and the remainder will pass through in March. So that's probably like -- sorry, May, and that's probably a $750 million hit for the year, if you like, on total fees. Ken Usdin : Yes. Thank you, Brian and thanks Alastair. Operator : We'll go now to Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Steven Chubak : Hi, good morning. Wanted to ask a follow-up on the earlier discussion on the 60% efficiency ratio. If we look at what you achieved last cycle, your terminal efficiency trajected closer to the upper 50s once the Fed funds rate eclipse 200 basis points. And want to get a sense whether there's a credible case for delivering a better-than-60% efficiency ratio this cycle, or there's structural factors supporting a higher terminal efficiency in this coming cycle? Brian Moynihan : Steven, the dynamics is going to be how big the wealth management business sits as a percentage of the total and just the dynamic set business. And that's always what constrained it even to the rest of the businesses. If I remember, a peak cycle, both Global Banking went well-below 50, Consumer went well below 50 and then between markets and Wealth Management. Now Wealth Management has done a great job of growing its loans and deposits, so that will help it. But that's always going to be the debate, and you should be cheering for strong Wealth Management revenues even if it means a little less efficiency ratio. Steven Chubak : Yeah. We'll certainly be cheering for that, Brian. Maybe just for my follow-up on capital. I know we've spent a lot of time talking about AOCI volatility and the like. We're always hoping to get a better sense of given that RWA growth has actually been the biggest source of capital consumption over the last couple of quarters, it's up about 9% year-on-year. Just given the pace of continued strong loan growth that's anticipated, what level of organic RWA growth should we be underwriting as we think about the capital algorithm going forward? Alastair Borthwick : Well, I think what you're looking to is some of the RWA growth has been coming from a pretty significant loans rebound, particularly in commercial. And I think you're looking at some of the investments we made in our Global Markets business. Some of that's a little seasonal, so it pops up in Q1. And some of it is year-over-year. So going forward, I think our growth -- will plenty of capital to support the growth that we expect in terms of RWAs. We manage that pretty closely. Again, the economy is beginning to return now to something more normal after bouncing around a bunch. So this quarter, when you think about those risk-weighted assets, 14 basis points. Brian's talked about one-third, one-third, one-third for share repurchase, dividend and growth. And that's probably a fair starting point. Steven Chubak : That\u2019s great color. Thanks for taking my questions. Operator : Our next question comes from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Vivek Juneja : Thanks for taking my question. A couple. What are you -- I heard the commentary about deposit balances, Brian, from you that they're still very high in the lower-end customers. However, if we start to get a little more granular, more very recently, are you starting to see any drawdown with higher spending because of inflation? Any color on that? I know quarter-over-quarter, they are. But as we start to look forward to see how things are progressing, are we seeing that yet? Brian Moynihan : It's actually the opposite of that. They grew faster from February to March, and that's probably because of the tax returns that they have. But basically, the broad way to think about it is beginning around May of last year, they grew 1%, not annualized, but 1% per month, pretty consistently 1% to 2% higher at the lower end balances. Only in the month of November, I think we saw a slight down draft in the lower end balances, and that picked back up in December, grew January, February, March, each month. It grew this quarter, and the March month was the strongest. So we might -- we haven't seen the data for April yet, but it's growing very strong, all the way up into the people who carried pre-pandemic at $10,000 to $20,000, our balances are still growing in very strongly. So we're not seeing that deteriorate at all yet. Vivek Juneja : And a completely different question for you, folks. Securities growth, didn't see that this quarter even if you ex out the mark-to-market stuff. What's your plan for that? Are you planning to grow securities balances? Should we be -- or what are you thinking at this point? Brian Moynihan : It all comes down to deposits. We keep growing deposits, we got to put it to work. So Alastair can give you more detail. But you remember what drives the size of our balance sheet, so our right-hand side, not our left. And so at $2 trillion -- we grew $200 billion -- or $180 billion, $190 billion deposits last year first quarter, this year first quarter. So, if we grow our deposits, which you should be cheering for on the core basis, we do, we will then invest those deposits in a careful way. Alastair Borthwick : And Vivek, if you look at this quarter, we added $8 billion of deposits. We added $14 billion of loans. That's always going to be our first choice in terms of investment. The securities balances came down a little bit, $13 billion. And remember, if you go back over the course of the past couple of years, in the pandemic, we didn't see the loans growth. So, in many ways that's one, we purchased some securities at which to replace loans that were coming off. That's not what we're seeing there. Now we're seeing the loans growth. So, our first years will always be for loans. And if we keep seeing the same kind of loan growth we're seeing right now, the securities may decline overtime they stay flat, we'll see, depends on deposits. Vivek Juneja : And how about in terms of liquid assets? What level should we think \u2013 should we expect, you would bring that down to? Because those have come down a little bit when you look at them quarter-over-quarter, and they're also down some year-over-year. Is there room for that to come down further? What sort of a run rate for that assuming, let's assume deposits were flat and didn't go down, didn't grow much modestly here, where can that be drawn down to? Alastair Borthwick : Yes. So liquidity is down in the quarter. That's largely based on funding the Global Markets business with seasonal. If you look year-over-year at our liquidity numbers, you'll see our global liquidity sources of $1.1 billion. They're up like a scutch from Q1 of last year. HQLA surplus is up. That's largely based on things like \u2013 again, Brian talks about our deposits at $2 trillion. We have -- we're probably more liquid now than we've ever been. And we've got plenty, I think, as we continue to grow deposits in the future. I hope our liquidity just continues to stay where it is or go higher. Vivek Juneja : Thank you. Operator : And we'll take a follow-up from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Mike Mayo : Hi. I was a little disappointed about the question related to terminal efficiency. I get, if you want to adjust Wealth Management. But with all the technology investments, shouldn't your incremental pretax margins be greater on your new revenues? And if so, shouldn't your terminal efficiency, business mix adjusted to be better than it was before? For example, specifically, your pretax margin in 2021 was 38%. Where should your pretax margins be on new revenues that are generated ahead? Brian Moynihan : The new revenues will generate more margin profit, Mike. And the efficiency ratio, let's always see where we get to, but it will keep coming down and we are improving every \u2013 all the way through into the pandemic and with operating leverage every quarter. And I think it's not going back and checking it quarter-by-quarter. I think it improved every quarter. It leaves aside some seasonality. But yes, we will keep driving it down.  Headcount, if this quarter was down another 100 people, it was down 4,000 last year. We are adding salespeople. We're opening new branches. We're investing in franchise. We've opened in the 7, 8, 10 markets and we have $30 billion of new deposits in those branches to give you a sense and there's only 140 branches. You know our strategy, Mike. So, it's always going to come down to balancing all that.  But at the end of the day, we're saying expenses are flat this year and NII improvement is going to flow to the bottom line. That's a pretty strong impact to efficiency, especially because it's going through the businesses, even the wealth management business. Mike Mayo : And then, one other follow-up. I mean, I don't think there's a recession this year, but I've been wrong before. And the stock market is telling us there might be a pretty good chance of a recession. So Brian and Alastair, what do you take the chance of recession is in 2022? You have a lot more people, data, businesses, insight into the US economy, and you need to have a percentage for that for your provision for loan losses. So is this 50% chance? 20% change? What do you think, Brian, kind of gut feel and Alastair, by the numbers? Brian Moynihan : I think, you're a good critic of and observer of banks, Mike, but the reality is, we have economists predict recessions and all the outages about them. But the -- and the reality is, they always have a prediction for recession that runs around 10%, 20% according to economists activity. But let me flip to what you really said, which is, we weighted the adverse scenario factor at a 40% factor in our baseline reserve setting. That produced a formulaic reserve, which is around 40% of our total reserves. And so, we have reserves on top of that basis for tough times. So I'm not going to chat a box with you about soft landing, hard landing and all that stuff. But the reality is, they've got to take the inflation out of system. They know that. The rising rates do that. But there's tensions against how easy or hard that\u2019s going to be, obviously, pandemic, war, but also this issue that the massive amount of stimulus is still out there being spent. So we're braced for every scenario. We model every scenario, but we don't -- I don't put a specific percentage. I just -- that's somebody else's job to do that, but our economists do not have a recession predicted in terms of this year, it's around 3% growth, next year, a little over 2%. And even though there may be some quarters that would show modest growth, I think they're all positive, so I got it right. Mike Mayo : Understood. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Your line is open. Gerard Cassidy : Hi, Brian. Hi, Alastair. Brian Moynihan : Gerard, how are you? Gerard Cassidy : Good. Thanks. Alistair, you guys are very well positioned, as you pointed out, for your balance sheet for rising interest rates, which seems very, very likely this year, obviously. And obviously, you guys are not a PT boat, but a battle crew -- battleship to turn the balance sheet into a position and when the Fed finally succeeds, let's say, in hitting inflation, knocking it down and they stop raising rates, maybe you going to have to cut rates get the economy going. When do you guys start thinking about after the Fed succeeds at reducing inflation, and you may have to reposition the balance sheet and not being as asset sensitive? Brian Moynihan : We don't. Well, Gerard, just to start, we -- basically, you know this as well as anybody having been around this industry for a number of years, let's just say. At the end of the day, the reason why we have securities investments is because we have $2 trillion of deposits and $1 trillion of loans. And so we got to do something with the money and that deposits are stable. They're core checking accounts. They're your core operating cash for commercial customers. So we put it to work to extract the value for the shareholders. And so, it's not that we lean the balance sheet. It's as we do all the work we do in the core franchise to grow the number of customers, 10% or 15% since pre-pandemic, and core consumer checking customers, to grow the commercial customer base, small business base, et cetera, that results in us having a balance sheet that is positioned to benefit in rising rates because we have so much zero cost deposits. And so we don't sit there and say, let's move the balance sheet. What we do is we try to protect in a cautious way all the risks. So we hedge the couple -- a year or so, 1.5 years ago. There were a lot of questions about, oh, my gosh, you're investing and rates are low. And we told people we hedge it, and now you're seeing the benefits of those hedges. That gave us NII from then until now to protect the capital, and that's what we did. So we're always trying to manage extracting the value deposits, give and then look to the other side and see the capital constraint question and the impact of capital, see other constraints on us. But it's really -- and we only invest in treasuries and mortgage-backed securities. We don't take a credit risk and materials in the treasury book for lack of a better term because we take enough of the end company. So I just don't -- we don't sit there and say, 'Let's move around.' It's just how do we invest this and we may move a little shorter or longer on what we invest in. But frankly, we swapped a lot of it to short just to protect ourselves so that we'd be able to redeploy to higher rates in the future. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And then as a follow-up, on the G-SIB buffer that you guys moved out that will take effect, I think you said, in 2024, the 50 basis point increase. Is there any strategies you can employ that could actually reduce that buffer before we get there, or is it really just retaining more earnings from your \u2013 for your day-to-day operations? Brian Moynihan : I think. We're growing through it because it has ways it's calculated that are not sensitive to our size, relative to the economy, stock price, all these kinds of things in it that move it around a little bit, but the reality is that wouldn't -- when we look at the core customer base, we wouldn't constrain core customer growth. We can always make efficiencies and move stuff around, and we saw -- believe it or not, as you can see in the other category of loans, which in that quarter, our franchise still left over, frankly, from 15, 17 years ago or have that was that we can let run off and stuff like that or sell out and stuff. But the reality is that the G-SIB buffer is growing because our customer franchise is getting bigger in a method of calculation does not adjust for business success, size of economy, stock market cap increase, all those things, which I think you have a pretty good favor of, Gerard. So we're going to have to retain 50 basis points more capital. So divide that 50 basis points by seven quarters and think about us pulling that through. The question of buffers to that number, yes, you should expect us to operate closer to that 10.75% just because, frankly, the number is getting so big that we've never had an issue of the size of capital implied by that buffer to the minimum regulatory minimum. Gerard Cassidy : Very good, gentlemen. Thank you. Yes, go ahead. Brian Moynihan : And that capital \u2013 as the earning style of the franchise generated 15.5% return on tangible common equity this quarter, and we'll continue to go up -- continue to be strong based on NII improvement. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Appreciate it. Operator : We'll take our final question from Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Chris Kotowski : Yes. Good morning. Thank you. Recognizing that the held-to-maturity portfolio doesn't get mark-to-market, I would think, though, on a kind of underlying core economic basis, it's never fun to have a large bond portfolio that's underwater. And just looking at your year-end disclosures, it looks like the vast majority of that held-to-maturity portfolio is agencies with a more than 10-year maturity. And I guess, how do you look at the extension risk on that portfolio? Again, recognizing it's not marked, but economically, is there any way to protect yourself in kind of a tail environment where rates go up a couple of hundred basis points like they did in 1981 or--? Alastair Borthwick : So, let me address that one. I think Brian's earlier answer got to the first part of it, which is we're not interest traders. We're interest rate managers to a cycle. We got to deliver for our shareholders in low rate environments, and we have to deliver for them in high rate environments. Those mortgages protected us in a low-rate environment. And now what protects us in a rising rate environment is precisely the asset sensitivity we still have left in the company. And so when you look at that $1.4 billion of growth, and now we're telling you, you should expect NII growth from here successively in each quarter, that's what protects us. It's that balance between capital, earnings, and liquidity. Brian Moynihan : And just the cash flow of the portfolio, even in a very low prepayment rate scenario, you got to remember people pay principal interest, people pass away and then people move irrespective of mortgage rates refinancing. And those numbers, all that cash can be redeployed at the higher rate structure. So, it turns a little faster than people think because everybody takes to zero prepayments, but the cash flow off of it is fairly significant. So, we'll redeploy that and walk back up the ladder. But -- and also remember, economically, if we don't market deposit, this is one of the great debates we've all had it not for accounting for banks. But the end of the day, the deposits are growing economically at a much faster rate than the degradation on the mortgage-backed portfolio. Chris Kotowski : Okay. All righty. Thank you. Brian Moynihan : I think that's all our questions. Thank you for joining us again this quarter. It's a strong quarter by the team and I want to thank the team for all the great work they've done. At the end of the day, as we told you last quarter and a few quarters before that, the organic growth machine in Bank of America is driving hard, growing its market share, growing its deposits, growing its loans, and doing well in the market. We will accelerate the P&L from that growth with the higher rates, as we told you. We'll continue to hold expenses in check, driving operating leverage, and that will always be a focus to get the most efficient growth we can. The strong customer activity, which we spoke about, continues even in the first part of April here. And so that would end up drive -- it's good for our company to drive our earnings. So, thank you. We look forward to talking to you next time. Operator : This does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.",

Later, you will have an opportunity to ask questions during the question-and-answer session. Please note, this call may be recorded . It is now my pleasure to turn today's program over to Lee McEntire. Lee McEntire : Good morning, and welcome. Happy Monday, and thank you for joining the call to review Bank of America's second quarter results. I hope everyone's had a chance to review our earnings release documents. As always, they're available, including the earnings presentation that we'll be referring to during this call, on the Investor Relations section of the bankofamerica.com website. I'm going to first turn the call over to our CEO, Brian Moynihan, for some opening comments, and then I'll ask Alastair Borthwick, our CFO, to cover the details of the quarter. Before I turn the call over to Brian, just let me remind you, we may make some forward-looking statements, and please refer to our non-GAAP financial measures during the call. Forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to materially differ from expectations are detailed in our earnings materials and SEC filings available on our website. Information about non-GAAP financial measures, including reconciliations to U.S. GAAP, can also be found on our earnings materials that are available on the website. So with that, Brian, I'll turn it over to you. Thanks. Brian Moynihan : Thank you, Lee, and thank you, all of you, for joining us today this quarter. Thanks to a great team here at Bank of America. We reported $6.2 billion in net income or $0.73 per diluted share. We delivered on our fourth straight quarter of operating leverage. We grew revenue 6%, while expense rose 1.5% for 4.5% of operating leverage compared to quarter 2 2021. We also saw a 21% year-over-year improvement in NII. These earnings generated a return on tangible common equity of 14% and return on assets of 79 basis points. As a reminder, when comparing our earnings in the second quarter of '21 to the earnings this quarter, in the second quarter '21, we recorded 2 items of note. In that quarter, net income benefited by $2 billion from a tax adjustment for a UK tax law change, and that was worth $0.23 to EPS. We also released $2.2 billion in credit reserves during that quarter that benefit earnings by $1.7 billion or $0.19 in EPS. This would bring that quarter's reported EPS to $1.03, down in the low 60s, and that compares to this quarter's $0.73 per share. This gain is illustrated by the increase in pretax pre-provision income, which includes these 2 -- which would exclude those 2 impacts, and that was $7.4 billion this quarter, improving 15% in PPNR improvement from the second quarter of 2021. So let's go to Slide 3. Let's talk about some of the drivers of results. The organic growth engine at Bank of America that existed pre-pandemic is back in full place here. And you can see that in the second quarter of 2021. This reflects in net new checking account openings, net new consumer investment accounts, net new household growth in Wealth Management, very strong loan growth across all products and good performance by Global Markets and investment banking teams, even given a quarter with volatile capital markets. Our expense management continues strong, and it benefits by the best digital banking platform in the world. Once again, we drove more users, saw more log-ins and usage, and that generated 20% more sales from the platform compared to last year. Our asset quality remains very strong with net charge-offs in the second quarter of 2021 still 50% below pre-pandemic levels in late 2019 when credit was pretty good. Breaking down the performance by segment, I'd make a few comments. Our Consumer Banking segment continued to see good momentum as we grew loans at the fastest quarterly pace in nearly 3 years. We added more than 240,000 net new checking accounts in the quarter, in the second quarter alone. We opened new financial centers and renovated others and deepened digital engagement with both consumer and small business clients. And after considering the highly elevated consumer income tax outflows, payments of taxes is good for the government, we saw good deposit activity. In our Wealth Management segment, in a period of declining market values where stocks and bonds had the worst first half in 5 decades, revenues still grow in that business 7% year-over-year, and we expanded our pretax margin. Our banking business with clients overcame the market values and weakness. We added more than 5,100 net new households across Merrill and Private Bank. Across our entire Wealth platform, Merrill, the Private Bank; and our consumer investments team, Merrill Edge, client balances, including deposit investments and loans, totals $3.8 trillion at 6/ 30/2022, aided by nearly $150 billion of client inflows over the last year into those businesses. Our Global Banking team grew loans 5% linked quarter. That's 5% in a single quarter, 20% annualized. We also saw Global Treasury Services revenue as customers utilize our service to management quality stand up well in the quarter. Overall revenue in Global Banking was impacted by the weaker investment banking fees that were available in this volatile market; lower investment banking fees; and we also had marks, as previously discussed, our leveraged finance positions. Our NII improvement nearly offset all those impacts, leaving revenue only modestly down year-over-year. We maintained our #3 investment banking market share ranking. In Markets, we had a solid quarter of sales and trading results, growing 11% from last year ex DVA. Our macro FICC business, where we have been investing over the last couple of years, performed well, as did the equity derivatives, while the FICC businesses felt the effects of spread widening and customers taking a more risk-off position. From a broader enterprise, our P&L perspective, quarter 2 expense was down modestly from quarter 1, consistent with what we told you on our last call. It is notable that we achieved that even as quarter 2 included approximately $425 million in regulatory matters that Alastair will discuss in a few minutes. As I said earlier, one of the reasons we continue to have good expense results and continued progress on digital engagement across the businesses. I commend you to look at slides 22, 27, 29 in our appendix where we set forth our digital operating results by lines of business. Overall, digital sales continue to grow, up 20%. Digital choice for payments continue to grow. Sale transactions continue to outdistance checks written, crossing of the last year, and the gap continues to widen. Erica is approaching 1 billion interactions since we started with it. Clients have filled out 8 million life plans, enhancing our asset growth and account retention. That's one of the fastest-growing product implementations we've had. It is also worth noting the strong credit quality. Most all of asset quality metrics improved again this quarter. You will note, however, the charge-offs rose in quarter 2, but this increase was largely due to some loan sale accounting and some other credit decisions due to the past pandemic issues. As I've done for several quarters, I want to make a few points about customer activity. Let's go to Slide 4. Buyer data crossed the 35 million core checking households plus we have in 60 million consumers in America. U.S. consumers remain quite resilient. I would offer a few thoughts as you look at Slide 4. In addition, I'll give you where we see -- what we see so far in July in a moment. First, customers -- consumers continue to spend at a healthy pace even as quite some time has passed since the receipt of any stimulus. Second, the overall average deposit balances for most cohorts are higher than they were both last quarter and even rose in June versus May. They remain at multiples above the pre-pandemic levels. And importantly, we're seeing no deterioration in our customers' asset quality, and they have the capability to borrow. Our customer data shows Bank of America customers spent the highest quarterly period on record in quarter 2 at $1.1 trillion in total spending. That's up 12% year-over-year. This quarter also was the highest debit-spending period on record for us. But as you think about more recently, just to give you the more recent statistics, in June 2022, spending was up 11.3% over June 2021. Transactions also rose more than 6%. For the first 2 weeks of July, the spending is up 10% plus in transactions, again, rising 6% plus. This is strong consumer resilience. We continue to see shifts in what people are spending on as the quarter took place more on experiences, travel and things like that and a bit more on fuel due to increased prices and less on retail stores. In quarter 2, we saw that higher gas spend as well as the continued recovery in the travel categories and a continued recovery in restaurant spending. In the lower right-hand chart, you'll note the continued shift in how people spend money. The check and cash volumes continue to come down and are replaced by digital alternatives. This continues to help on our cost structure. Regarding our customer liquidity, average deposit balance of our customers remained at high levels relative to the year ago in pre-pandemic periods. The larger change for the mass market customers, they rose about 1% over June from May. The only area where we had any change to the negative was a small dip, 1%, for the most affluent segments of those customers. That reflects the tax payments made in April and the build back coming more slowly for those customers. In addition to this data, I would refer you to Slides 24 and 25, which completes the resiliency picture. That shows you strong asset quality across our consumers. Also look at elevated payment rates on credit cards. That means people paying off their debt at a good clip. There's no real differentiation across the trends in customer cohorts, even for the very small portion of our card book that is in lower credit quality. So while all this is good news, it clearly makes the Fed's job tougher when you take these statistics and this activity and combine it with a low unemployment rate. I want to switch gears now and talk a little bit more about credit. We provided more information on credit this quarter as would be obvious, given the debate about a future recession. Whether it's debate and discuss this potential outcome, we just continue to drive responsible growth at our company, and so we're prepared. So as you look at Slide 5, you can see how much the loan book has changed under more than a decade of responsible growth. As you can see on the top left chart, our loan book is quite well balanced now between consumer and commercial loans. Focusing on the top right chart, note that the consumer portfolio is even more collateralized with a greater mix of mortgage and less card. In addition, much less second mortgage, and obviously, second mortgage as they underwritten clearly differently than they were in the mid-2000 to 2010 decade in all consumer portfolios have much higher FICOs. In the bottom left chart, you'll note that more diversified commercial mix as well. And if you look at the lower right chart, you can see our results on the stress test and how they fared time and time again. When you go to Slide 6, we gave you a little detail on what we look like in the high the last crisis compared to where we are now. You can see the loan portfolio in 2009 when risk were at the peak for Bank of America. Because this was after we closed the Merrill and the countrywide transactions and the company was all put together. We give you those metrics, what they look like pre-pandemic at the end of 2019 and what they look like today. On the right are the changes we've made under that decade-plus of responsible growth. Given all these changes, 92% of our commercial loan book today is either investment-grade or secured. And while there is not much difference in something like commercial real estate book, you have to look underlying to see the changes. For instance, the land development loans increased -- have decreased from $5 billion in '09 to $200 million currently, and secured residential exposure decreased from $11 billion to $150 million now. We've also included a few slides in our appendix, Pages 23 to 25, to highlight the consumer resilience and delinquency points as well as our consumer lending statistics, highlighting this continued strong quality of all our originations. Take note of the FICOs on the newly originated activity there. So in the end, despite the worries of a slower economy and other global issues, client activity remained good this quarter, NII has improved quickly, and our customers' resilience and health remains strong. We recognized some expense from regulatory matters and still managed to keep expenses flat to the first quarter and in line with what we told you. We continue to drive strong operating leverage in a weaker capital markets environment. These earnings are delivering strong returns and delivering capital back to shareholders. And thinking about capital, remember, first, we use our capital to support customers and related loans, and we continue to invest in the franchise. Second, we are delivering capital back to you, shareholders. We announced our intent to increase our dividend in quarter 3, which we have our dividend 22% higher than it was just 12 months ago. In addition, we retired shares this quarter. Third, we're going to be building capital given the new higher amounts received during the stress test. It will make our balance sheet even stronger. Along the way, we believe our expected earnings generation over the next 18 months will provide an ample amount of capital, which allows us to support customer growth, pay dividends and use the rest to allocate between buying back shares and growing into our new capital requirement. And with that, I'll turn it over to Alastair. Alastair Borthwick : Thank you, Brian. And since Brian hit the highlights of the income statement, I just want to reiterate, we saw good returns in the quarter with a return on tangible common equity of 14% and return on assets of 79 basis points. So I'm going to begin my comments on Slide 7 and the balance sheet. And as you can see, during the quarter, the balance sheet declined $127 billion to a little more than $3.1 trillion, and that reflected an $88 billion decline in deposits and a decrease in our Global Markets balance sheet. We utilized a combination of cash and some rotation from securities this quarter to fund our loans growth given the decline in deposits. Our average liquidity portfolio declined in the quarter, reflecting a drop in deposits and lower securities valuation, and it remains very elevated at nearly $1 trillion. For reference, that was $576 billion pre-pandemic, just to give you an idea of how much liquidity has increased over the period. Shareholders' equity increased to $2.5 billion from Q1 with a few different components we should note. Shareholders' equity benefited from net income after preferred dividends of $5.9 billion and the issuance of $2 billion in preferred stock. So that's $7.9 billion flowing into equity. We paid out $2.2 billion in common dividends and net share repurchases. AOCI declined as a result of the increase in loan rates. And we saw that impact in 2 ways. First, we had a reduction from a change in the value of our available-for-sale debt securities of $1.8 billion, and that impacts CET1. Second, rates also drove a $2 billion decline in AOCI from derivatives that does not impact CET1, and that reflects cash flow hedges mostly put in place last year against some of our variable rate loans, and that provided some NII growth and also protected CET1 at the same time. With that equity growth, we saw book value increase in the quarter. With regard to regulatory capital, our supplemental leverage ratio increased 10 basis points to 5.5% versus our minimum requirement of 5%, leaving plenty of capacity for balance sheet growth. And our TLAC ratio remains comfortably above our requirements. Okay. Let's turn to Slide 8, and we'll talk about CET1, where our capital levels remain very strong. We have $172 billion of CET1 and a 10.5% CET1 ratio, which increased from the first quarter and remains well above our second quarter 9.5% minimum requirement. That 10.5% CET1 ratio is also expected to be just above our new 10.4% requirement from CCAR when it's confirmed by regulators at the end of August. And that new level will be effective for us on October 1. I'll walk through the drivers of the CET1 ratio this quarter. First, $5.9 billion of earnings, net of preferred dividends, which generated 36 basis points of capital. And looking at the chart, you can see how we use that. We grew loans by $38 billion. And with a decline in our Global Markets balance sheet and some loan sales and other balance sheet initiatives, we were able to hold RWA flat this quarter. Second, we returned $2.7 billion of capital to shareholders, representing 16 basis points. Third, this quarter, the movement in treasury and mortgage-backed securities rates caused a decline in the fair value of our available-for-sale debt securities, and that lowered our CET1 ratio by 11 basis points. And we remained well positioned for that rate movement as our hedge of a large portion of this portfolio continue to protect it from AOCI movements. So we ended the quarter above our expected minimum of 10.4% required October 1, and we expect to build some additional buffer on top of that in Q3. Moving beyond the third quarter, we should just remind you, our balance sheet growth last year means our G-SIB surcharge and CET1 requirement will move higher by 50 basis points beginning in 2024. And I just want to make sure we repeat that for clarity, it's 2024 because I know others have different time lines for their requirements. Given our additional higher G-SIB minimum over the next 6 quarters, we'll work to move above that expected CET1 minimum of 10. 9% by January 1, 2024, and we'll look to exceed that with another 50 basis points of internal management buffer on top of that requirement. Okay. So now let's talk about the biggest use of CET1 this quarter, and I'm referring to loans on Slide 9. As you review the average loan data, we just want to remind you that our discipline around responsible growth has remained tight. Average loans have climbed back over $1 trillion. They're up 12% compared to Q2 '21, led by commercial growth of 15% and complemented by consumer growth of 8%. Each line of business and product segment reflected good growth, and geographic and industry participation within that growth has also broadened over the past several quarters. As we turn to linked quarter comparisons, I'll use ending balances. And the $25 billion linked quarter commercial improvement came mostly from new loans and also included some improved utilization from existing clients. From an asset quality standpoint, 98% of the commercial loan growth was either investment-grade or secured. Consumer loans grew $10 billion linked quarter, led by both credit card and mortgage and also increases in auto and securities-based lending. And for the first time in years, home equity balances increased modestly. Card loans grew $5 billion from Q1, reflecting healthy spend levels even as payments rates remain elevated. Within our growth, our average FICO was 771, as you can see on Slide 23 in the appendix. And as we've done in the past, in the appendix on Slide 32, we've provided that daily ending loan chart that shows trends through the quarter, and you can see both commercial and consumer loans balances are now back to pre-pandemic periods with really only credit cards still remaining 15% to 20% below that period. Moving to deposits on Slide 10. Across our past 12 months, we've seen solid growth across the client base as we've deepened relationships and added new accounts. Some of the year-over-year growth was impacted by a higher level of tax payments across consumer and GWIM clients and businesses in Q2 of this year. Those elevated tax payments drove the decline in deposits from Q1. Year-over-year average deposits are up $123 billion or 7%. And retail deposits with our Consumer and Wealth Management clients grew $129 billion, and we believe our retail deposits of $1.4 trillion continue to lead all competitors. Within the consumer balances, I'd just like to point out that small business deposits of $177 billion grew 14% year-over-year, and that reflects continued reopening of small businesses across America and the consumer spending supporting their growth. The average balance of these accounts is more than $40,000. On Wealth Management, we saw clients paying higher tax bills this year, and we saw some move deposits to market-based funds, much of which remained in our own complex. With our commercial clients, deposits were up modestly year-over-year, even as customer tax payments are higher this year. And some have recently begun to seek higher yields and use cash strategically for acquisitions and other operational activities. Turning to Slide 9 and net interest income. On a GAAP non-FTE basis, NII in Q2 was $12.4 billion, and the FTE net interest income number was $12.5 billion. Focusing on FTE, NII increased $2.2 billion from the second quarter of last year or 21%, and that's driven by benefits from higher interest rates, including lower premium amortization and loans growth. NII compared to the first quarter rose $870 million, and that came in a good bit higher than the $650 million plus that we signaled on our last earnings call. The benefits of higher rates, lower premium amortization, loans growth and the additional day of interest, more than offset the impact of lower securities balances. Our net interest yield was 1.86%, improving 17 basis points from Q1 and benefited from the rise in rates, loans growth funded with cash and a 4 basis point improvement from lower premium amortization on securities. Looking forward, we want to provide the following NII guidance, and we just have to provide a few caveats. First, we based the guidance on interest rates and the forward curve materializing, and I'm referring to the curve on July 15th. Second, we assume modest growth in loans and deposits. And third, we assume deposit betas reflecting disciplined pricing to achieve our growth. If those assumptions hold true, we can see NII in Q3 increase by at least $900 million, possibly $1 billion, versus Q2. And then we expect it to grow again at a faster pace on a sequential basis in the fourth quarter. And the way we think about those NII increases, given the expense discipline that we have, is we expect the majority of that to fall to the bottom line for shareholders. Focusing on asset sensitivity for a moment. As you know, we typically disclose our asset sensitivity based on a 100 basis point instantaneous parallel shock in rates above the forward curve. And on that forward basis, asset sensitivity at June 30 was $5 billion of expected NII over the next 12 months. More than 90% of that is driven by short rates. That's down from $5.4 billion at March 31, largely because the benefit of higher rates is now already factored into our baseline of actual NII after we grew the $870 million. Now given that the yield curve is projecting 125 basis points of rate hikes over the next couple of meetings, we thought it was also appropriate to provide the disclosure again regarding asset sensitivity on a spot basis. And on a spot basis, our sensitivity to a 100 basis point instantaneous rate hike would be $5.8 billion or $800 million higher than the forward basis at June 30. Okay. Let's turn to expense, and we'll use Slide 12. Our expenses were $15.3 billion, up a couple of hundred million or 1.5% from the year-ago period and down modestly compared to the first quarter. I want to focus on the more recent comparison versus the first quarter. We had higher expense for regulatory matters related to certain issues, and those offset the seasonal decline from the first quarter elevated payroll taxes and revenue-related incentive costs. Let me pause for a moment on the $425 million expense we've recognized for regulatory matters in the second quarter. A little more than half of the amount relates to fines to resolve regulatory investigations relating to our administration of prepaid unemployment benefit card programs in certain states and that we announced last week. The balance of the expense relates to an industry-wide issue, and it concerns the use of unapproved personal devices, and that has not yet been fully resolved. As we look forward, more broadly on expenses, we continue to invest heavily in technology, in people and in marketing across the businesses, and we continue to add new financial centers and renovated old ones in expansion and new growth markets. To help pay for those investments, we continued to look for opportunities to simplify our processes and reduce work, driving our costs lower to self-fund our new investments. Our headcount this quarter includes roughly 2,300 summer interns, and we hope they will consider us to be a great place to work and join us full time next year. This is the most diverse group of talent we've seen yet. Absent the addition of those interns, our headcount was down a little more than 700 associates. And we, like many other companies, are doing many things to tackle challenging labor market conditions, and we're meeting that challenge pretty well so far. Turning to asset quality on Slide 13. I want to repeat what we've said now for many, many quarters. The asset quality of our customers remains very healthy, and that's true in both consumer and commercial. So net charge-offs of $571 million increased $179 million from Q1, driven by loan sales and some other credit decisions that we made as opposed to core credit deterioration. Absent those losses, net charge-offs were down modestly compared to the year-ago period and up slightly from Q1. Provision expense was $523 million in Q2, driven by the charge-offs as we had a small reserve release of $48 million. Now that release includes builds for loan growth. It includes builds for a dampened macroeconomic outlook in the future. And the builds were offset by continued asset quality improvement and the effect of reduced pandemic uncertainty. On Slide 14, we're highlighting the credit quality metrics for both our consumer and commercial portfolios and a couple of things are worth repeating again this quarter. Consumer delinquencies remain well below pre-pandemic levels, and you can see the decline in reservable criticized. And NPLs saw a modest decrease, driven both by the loan sales mentioned earlier and other improvement across commercial. Turning to the business segments. Let's start with Consumer Banking on Slide 15. And the Consumer Bank earned $2.9 billion on good organic growth, delivering its fifth consecutive quarter of operating leverage. Strong top line growth of 12%, driven by net interest income improvement, was more than offset by increase in provision expense resulting from the prior year's much larger reserve release. And while reported earnings were down, pretax pre-provision earnings for Consumer grew 26% year-over-year, which highlights the earnings improvement without the impact of that reserve action. Card revenue was solid and increased modestly year-over-year as spending benefits were mostly offset by higher rewards costs. Service charges were down nearly $200 million year-over-year as our previously announced insufficient funds and overdraft policy changes were in full effect by June. The third quarter will reflect the full run rate going forward, and we believe these changes are helping to improve overall customer satisfaction and further lower customer attrition. Expense increased 2%, as much of our increased salary and wage moves in the quarter impact Consumer Banking the most. And as revenue grew, we improved the efficiency ratio to 54%. Reduced costs associated with continued shifts in client behavior to digital engagement is also allowing us to invest in higher marketing, more technology and higher wages for our people. We also continued our investment in financial centers, opening another 19 in the quarter while we renovated 157 more. Notable customer activity highlights included 240,000 net new checking accounts opened in the second quarter and marking the 14th consecutive quarter of net new consumer checking account growth. This led to a record 35 million consumer checking accounts with 92% of them considered to be their primary account. Additionally, small business accounts are enjoying the features of their business Advantage Rewards and showed growth of 5% from last year. We also grew investment account 6% year-over-year. And not surprisingly, the market impacted customer balances negatively on the investment side. At the same time, over the past 12 months, we've seen 21 billion of positive client inflows. Lastly, once again, we opened over 1 million credit cards in the quarter, and we grew average active card accounts and saw combined credit and debit card spend up 10%. And as you saw earlier, we had solid lending activity with continued low loss rates. Our 43 million active digital users signed on this quarter a record 2.8 billion times, with our Erica users up 30% year-over-year, and we captured over 123 million total client interactions in the second quarter alone. You can see all the other digital metrics and trends on Slide 26. Turning to Wealth Management on Slide 16. You can see we produced strong results, earning $1.2 billion and producing 16% year-over-year growth. Revenue growth was 7% as NII generated through our banking assistance for these clients more than offset modest declines in assets under management fees from market impacts during a challenging quarter. Clients and advisers recognize this value of a holistic financial relationship across investments and banking. And doing that at Bank of America differentiates both Merrill and the Private Bank, and it helps to diversify and differentiate our earnings in this business compared to other brokers. Our talented group of financial advisers, coupled with powerful digital capabilities, allowed modern Merrill to gain nearly 4,500 net new households. We also gained 650 more in the Private Bank this quarter. And that's a very solid showing by both, given the complexities of serving our clients in challenging market conditions over the past 90 days. We added $25 billion of loans over the last year, growing 13% and marking 49 consecutive quarters of loans growth in the business, and that is consistent and sustained performance. Assets under management flows and deposit growth were a little more muted this quarter as clients paid taxes impacting the quarter-to-quarter comparison. Year-over-year, our deposits were up $17 billion, and overall investment flows were $78 billion over the past 4 quarters with total flows of $110 billion. Expenses increased 2%, driven by higher employee-related costs and resulted in operating leverage of 6%. Turning to Slide 17 and Global Banking. You'll see the business earned $1.5 billion in the second quarter, down $918 million year-over-year and driven the absence of a large prior period reserve release and lower investment banking revenue. As you know, it was a tough comparative quarter for the business as the industry investment banking fee pool declined 50%. And while we acknowledge that's a big drop, we just want to remind you that before the pandemic, our quarterly average for investment banking fees was in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion compared to the $1.1 billion we put up in the second quarter. So we view this level as temporary, and we believe it can rise back to more normal levels in the next few quarters when economic uncertainty becomes more muted. While the company's overall investment banking fees declined, we held on to our #3 ranking in overall fees, and we maintained our market share through the first half of the year compared to 2021. At the same time, we saw very strong loans growth. Ending loans grew $18 billion linked quarter and are up $62 billion or 19% year-over-year. That loans growth and higher rates drove net interest income growth, which was able to offset the drop in investment banking fees, leaving revenues in the business fairly flat year-over-year. Also impacting revenue was half of the firm's $300 million leveraged finance valuation marks. The market turmoil and abrupt slowdown in the second quarter sparked a downturn in the leveraged finance markets, causing a number of the deals across various market participants to get marked down. Some of those deals have been funded, and we're working through any remaining exposure to get them through the market. The provision expense increase reflects a reserve build of $143 million in Q2 compared to an $834 million release in the year-ago period. And finally, we saw expenses increase by 8%, driven by higher personnel costs and a share of the noted expenses for regulatory matters. Switching to Global Markets on Slide 18. And as we usually do, we'll talk about the segment results, excluding DVA. Second quarter net income of $900 million reflects a solid quarter of sales and trading revenue. It was another quarter that favored macro trading, while the credit trading business has faced a more challenging market environment with widening spreads in the face of increased inflation fears and recession beliefs. Focusing on year-over-year, Sales and trading contributed $4 billion to revenue, improving 11%. FICC was up 19%, while equities was up 2%. That FICC improvement was primarily driven by growth in our macro products, while credit-traded products were down. We've been investing heavily over the past year in several of the macro businesses identified as opportunities for us, and we were rewarded for that this quarter. Our strength in equities was driven by good performance in derivatives and offset by a weaker trading performance in cash. Lastly, also impacting revenue was the other half of the firm's $300 million in leveraged finance markdowns. Year-over-year expense declined, reflecting the absence of costs associated with the realignment of a liquidating business activity, partially offset by that share of the regulatory costs. Absent these impacts, expense was relatively unchanged. And the business generated an 8% return in Q2, impacted by both the elevated leveraged finance marks and regulatory matter expense. Finally, on Slide 19, we show All Other which reported a loss of $318 million, declining from the year-ago period, driven by the prior period $2 billion tax benefit from that UK tax law change. Revenue is roughly a couple of hundred million higher than Q2 '21 due to the absence of some prior period structured note losses. Expense increased as a result of the regulatory matters and the realignment of liquidating activity last year to All Other. And as a reminder, for the financial statement presentation in this release, the business segments all are taxed on the standard fully taxable equivalent basis. And in All Other, we incorporate the impact of our ESG tax credits and any other unusual items. For the quarter, our effective tax rate was 9%. That benefited from 2 things : First, ESG investment tax credits; and second, roughly $300 million of discrete tax benefits that applied to this quarter. Excluding those tax credits and discrete items, our tax rate would have been 26%. And with that, we'll jump into Q&A, please. Thank you. Operator :  We'll take our first question today from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Glenn Schorr : So I'm looking at all your credit metrics improving on a modest reserve release in the quarter and everything you said about responsible growth, it's all great. But my question is, how do you balance making sure that you're not looking too much in the back, the rearview mirror and see where we came from versus what we're going towards and people's obvious concerns about the go forward and the economy. And maybe within that, let's just talk about what leading indicators you'd look at that drive, say, if you thought about putting up a CECL reserve on the go forward? You don't sound that concerned, but like lot of people looking at a recession here. Brian Moynihan : Glenn, thanks for the question. Remember, the reserve methodology is a forward-looking methodology. And our core scenario is weighted part of the baseline, part of the adverse and ends up, just to give you a sense with unemployment rate this year in the actual reserve setting scenario, not an adverse case. But the actual, when we set the reserves was with 5% employment within the next 5 months, so 3.6% to 5%. So it's a -- there's a conservative aspect of how the reserves are set. And so basically, the high quality of the loan book is not only what we talk about and show you all the stats and you can assess and look at, but also, you can look at the stress test results on a relative 10% unemployment overnight, yada, yada, yada, and you see all the different statistics there. And you see that page on Page 5 or 6 or whatever is in a slide, you can see us lower than everybody else's, that's because many, many years of responsible growth and while we showed you those pages comparing the different points in time. And so I think you said something, our reserve is not set looking backwards, it's set looking forward based on the books, based on the CECL methodology. We even do a comparison to where CECL day 1, as we call it, what happened then, and it's consistent. It's consistent. It's just that the credit quality book continues to improve, honestly. Glenn Schorr : I love the signs of reference. Maybe just one follow-up on RWA, you didn't seem to need to do much. I appreciate the comments you made on the prepared remarks. So the question I have is there seems to be a much higher intent across The Street to mitigate RWA. For obvious reasons, everybody's capital requirements are going up. So the question I have for you is have you balanced doing more of belt tightening versus using your okay relative capital position to continue to grow while others are tightening the belt? Alastair Borthwick : Thanks, Glenn. So obviously, we're in a little different place in that we have the capital already. And we feel like over the course of the past several years, we've been quite disciplined around our RWAs. It just remains important for us to stay at it. So you saw us do a couple of things this quarter. We sold a portfolio of loans that were noncore. We've changed a little bit in terms of as the sum of the 20% risk-weighted assets in our securities portfolio are rolling off, we can replace them with 0% risk-weighted like treasuries with essentially the same yield at this point. So you saw what we did this quarter. We grew loans. We built capital. We created some RWA flex in the background, and we think we can do the same going forward. Operator : We'll go next to Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global. James Mitchell : Maybe just if I look at the -- you're still projecting relatively healthy asset sensitivity even with the forward curve at a high level. So it doesn't -- I think when I look at the comparison versus the spot, it implies not a real big degradation in betas in the forward versus the spot. So can you discuss how you think about deposit betas as Fed funds gets above 300 basis points? Alastair Borthwick : Yes. So we talked about -- the last time we were together, we talked about the fact we're looking backwards to 2015 to 2019, and you saw what our deposit beta was at the time. It was in that sort of low 20s percent. And we said we hope to do better. We have done better than that so far. Now just as a reminder, generally speaking, we think about how we price so that we grow deposits. Now that growth last year was 7%. We're expecting growth this year that we said in the low single digits. But we're going to have to see how the rate structure develops. We've been pretty clear on that as well. And we're going to be competing in the market with others, so we just have to watch that develop over time. The core operating balances, consumer, we continue to add there over time. And if we're seeing any kind of runoff, Jim, it's really only in the very high end of Wealth Management, and it's in the non-operating balances in commercial. So we're keeping a tight eye on it, but our NII reflects, we think, are reasonable assumptions around deposit pricing. James Mitchell : So just to clarify, you -- go ahead. Brian Moynihan : And Jim, just look at Page 10, and you can see if you look at the upper right-hand corner and see the size of the noninterest-bearing and interest checking, which is different than money it moves. And you think about that even in the Wealth Management deposits on the lower left and then the operating deposits in the commercial book, we just have a lot of these deposits that are money and movement in the household. And we've gone through this discussion a lot a few years ago. And so they're very intensive rates only because the money is always moving, and it's just the average collective balances in these households as opposed to money that's for investment purposes, which will move. And you saw it move a little bit in the Wealth Management business this quarter, and some of the corporates will continue to position them for more investment-oriented cash for lack of a better term. And so we'd expect that to occur. But I think history is some guide here, but also at the end of the day, we've grown 1 million new checking accounts year-over-year. So that brings them more and more stable core checking balances, which don't move around much. And so think about all that, and we've been through it before. And as rates go up, the stuff that moves due to rate is relatively modest. And we have a huge bucket of noninterest-bearing that sits with us. James Mitchell : Right. So I mean, clearly, you guys have a high-quality deposit base. So I think the implication is even over 300 basis points, you think, betas can stay sort of in that well under 50% range, if not putting words in your mouth. Brian Moynihan : Yes. We tell our team to price consistently so they can grow faster, slightly faster than the market. They have been growing a lot faster than the market because of the stimulus and stuff like that, but let's -- even the market, they will grow much faster. But that's what we tell them. And so we don't do things to hurt the franchise. James Mitchell : Right. And then on the capital side, just trying to get a sense of how quickly you want to get to a buffer and how to think about a buffer on your -- whether it's 2024 minimum or '23, can you still do some buybacks between now and then? Alastair Borthwick : So we already have a modest buffer relative to what we expect at the end of October. And then we've got, obviously, future capital generation, and we've got some balance sheet optimization we can do. So we feel like we've got a lot of flexibility. So we feel like we've got some ability to do some share repurchase. And then in terms of where we end up, I'd say, go fast forward to January of 2024, that's when we get the next 50 basis point step up. So we've got to generate that 50 basis points over the next 6 quarters. So we think we'll have some ability to do a little bit of everything. Operator : We'll go now to Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Michael Mayo : Well, thanks for the NII guide. I guess my -- well, first, we're going to be here -- it's probably January 18, 2023, 2 quarters from now, we'll be on the earnings call, and we'll see if your guidance is correct or not. And I know you don't want to give guidance that you don't meet, but you just guided for almost $2 billion in higher NII in the next 2 quarters, implying an $8 billion uptick in the annualized run rate for NII. I just want to make sure I heard that correctly. And then on your definition of majority of that should fall in the bottom line. How do you define majority? Is that 50.1%? Or is it more than that? Alastair Borthwick : So I'll answer the question. Yes, I think you're right. We said $900 million to $1 billion this quarter coming up and then at least that, the following quarter. So yes, you're right to think about that as a couple of billion. We'll get a little more precise with fourth quarter as we get to, obviously, a quarter from now. And with respect to falling to the bottom line, I'd say that's going to be the vast majority, but I'll leave that to Brian. Brian Moynihan : I think, Mike, we're bouncing around $15 billion to $15.5 billion of quarterly operating costs. And you can look backwards and see that, that's been fairly constant. And so you'd expect that to continue. And so the vast, vast majority falls to the bottom line. It's out of the business model. And you know, Mike, as well as anybody that, that revenue comes through the businesses that don't need to add people or activity to get the value of it, i.e. the consumer business in the Wealth Management business and Commercial Banking business. And you saw that year-over-year. I mean as much as it's a strong projection going forward, we captured like $2 billion last year second quarter, this year second quarter. And I think a lot of it fell to the bottom line on an apples-to-apples basis. Michael Mayo : I mean just as one follow-up. I mean, look, you've changed the firm since the global financial crisis when the company overpromised and under-delivered. And you've really gone out of your way to under-promise and over-deliver. And so when you say phrases like vast, vast majority, don't you want to hedge a little bit? I mean you have a lot of inflationary pressures. You're hearing talk about it's harder to hire people, harder to retain people. You have rents. You have all sorts of things happening here. And you're saying vast, vast majority of these additional revenues should fall to the bottom line. Any hedging at all you'd like to give here? Brian Moynihan : I think basically, what -- I don't -- I'd look at the quarter-to-quarter linkage expenses of 15.3 and NII, we told you it was up, what did we say, 650 last quarter, turn to 850. So we exceed our estimates. That's why we stayed in the next couple of quarters because we've got a pretty good line of sight to those, Mike. So we feel pretty good about it. Alastair Borthwick : The question that you asked all or you kept asking me last quarter is how you do this, keep investing in franchise. So we increased marketing. We added people in the places we want to add people and took people out of the place that we didn't need them so much. We continue to add new branches in the many cities and towns we didn't have the brand structure and repositioned. In other words, we invested this quarter, $800 million in technology co-development that got implemented. And so -- but it's -- this is -- the confidence in the next quarter, frankly, is it's already 3 weeks in almost, and it's pretty well set up. So we feel pretty good. Operator : Our next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Two questions. First is just on the investments that you're making in expanding your market share and capital markets activities. You've obviously made a decision to do that and it's panned out. And I wanted to understand at this stage, given the higher  that you have, will you still be leaning into investing and trying -- and looking to take more share in the capital markets-related businesses? Brian Moynihan : Yes, they're largely, as Jimmy DeMare would say, the so-called growth plan that we talked about starting almost 2.5 years ago was implemented, then in order that we increased the size of the balance sheet. You can see a little bit on Page 18 trading-related assets, but you'd have to go back a quarter, a year before that and see it have increased. And so he's built the balance sheet up to the size he thinks is relevant. We built the product capabilities out. He continues to hire people in certain areas. And so we feel pretty good that we're pretty well built. It's just that we've done it in market times, it got pretty interesting, pretty fast. And that being said, if you look at the trading revenue sort of first half of the year over the last 3 years has been relatively stable at $8 billion-ish or something like that. So it's -- so he's done a good job. They build it up. And so it doesn't need another big hump -- chunk of balance sheet on top of that. It's really in pretty good shape now. And so it's a relative size of the platform is pretty well set. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And then as we think about the capital ratio and the buffer, I think you had been running with a 100 bps buffer. And should we now expect that you're going to be running with 50 bps over? Brian Moynihan : Yes. You should. That -- frankly, as it gets larger and larger, it gets to be a little bit -- you don't need quite the buffer. And so that 50 basis points is to the -- if you think about we get to 1/1/24, put 50 basis points on top of your card, and that's what we're trying to end up. Operator : We'll take our next question from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Matt O'Connor : Just a follow-up on the expenses. How are you thinking about costs in the back half of the year? And then I think you had full year guidance out there of around $60 billion. Obviously, you had some higher reg costs this quarter. So how are you thinking about that? Alastair Borthwick : So we haven't changed much, Matt, in terms of the way we think about running the company. Brian mentioned already, if you look at the last 6 quarters, we're sort of running the place right around $15 billion, out-of-sight. So we still feel like that's the right place, that $60 billion flattish year-over-year. And then I just make sure you back out and add that reg matter. That's all. The core remains the same. Matt O'Connor : Okay. Just want to clarify that. That's helpful. And then within credit, I guess, what types of mortgages did you sell that generated those losses? And then in All Other consumer, you had higher losses and you did mention there were some other actions that you took, and I was just wondering what those were. Alastair Borthwick : So on the resi mortgage side, that's -- we sold an old portfolio of residential mortgages that we put in All Other sum number of years ago. So this allowed us an opportunity just to exit that. We do that periodically anyway. But in this case, it was about $3.3 billion, I want to say. And we did have a loss, so you see that loss running through. But just so you're aware, it was largely offset by a gain somewhere else. So I wouldn't think about it as much of an economic loss, but it did temporarily inflate the charge-offs, which is why we called it out. And then there are a couple of other things in there that related to write-downs around pandemic and stimulus and offsets with overdraft. But again, not what I would consider to be anywhere near the core consumer credit portfolio that we run. Matt O'Connor : Okay. Some about overdraft shows up in the All Other consumer charge-offs, right? Alastair Borthwick : In this case, yes. Operator : We'll go now to Erika Najarian with UBS. Erika Najarian : I just wanted to keep on Mike's theme of under-promising and over-delivering. So I'm going to try to ask the NII question another way. Alastair, one of your peers has started to frame NII with regards to an exit rate in the fourth quarter. And as I'm just thinking about the rate sensitivity and the forward curve in your comments about loans and deposits and deposit repricing, obviously, you're alluding to $13.5 billion by third quarter. Is it possible by the fourth quarter, relative to everything that you're seeing going on in the company right now, that the exit rate for NII could approach $15 billion? Alastair Borthwick : Well, I'd say it's too early for us to tell you that right now. So one of the reasons that we're comfortable giving you next quarter's guide is we have a pretty good sense for where loans are, deposits are, what we think the growth will look like, et cetera. The further we go out, the less we control. So we try to give you that spot sensitivity, and we try to give you the forward sensitivity so you just get a general sense. And then what we're comfortable saying right now is it's going to be in that $900 million to $1 billion for Q3. And Q4, it's just a little early to say with that kind of precision. So we just wanted to say we think it will accelerate again in Q3 -- sorry, in Q4. So that's as precise as we want to be right now, Erika. And it's less about under-promising and over-delivering, it's more about there's just a lot going on right now in the markets generally, and we'd prefer to be precise -- more precise about it. That's all. And I think all we're trying to convey though is we think the fourth quarter is going to be higher than the third quarter increase. And that's just something. I think we'll give you -- we'll be able to give you more sense for that based on the rate structure and what we see in deposits and loans over the course of this quarter when we meet in 3 months' time. Brian Moynihan : Erika, this isn't going to give you a specific NII guidance. We're just trying to make sure you see the leverage in the platform for a quarter or 2. And you guys can take that and extrapolate based on your own economic projections, but it's meant just to give you a sense of what we see in terms of loans, deposits and the pricing dynamics, et cetera. In the near term, we're more sure. Just like last quarter, we said it'd be 600-odd billion, and it turned out to be 800-ish because we're careful what we think and what we give you. Erika Najarian : Got it. And my second question is a follow-up on capital. I guess the first is are you working to actively reduce the stress capital buffer? And maybe remind us where you think the pain points were for this year's test that you think you could address for next year? And second, should we -- what is the pacing of buybacks like from here as you potentially -- as you -- or not potentially, as you build towards that January 1, 2024, new hire minimum? Alastair Borthwick : On the second question, that's going to be dictated by our LOBs use of the balance sheet. Our #1 goal is to keep them in the market winning every day and let the capital support that. That's what we do because what they're doing is providing good returns and stuff. So that requires us to -- well, it will be driven by, frankly, loan growth more than anything else in the near term because the markets business will bounce around but won't move much. In terms of the stress test, look, the losses and stuff are pretty good. It's the operating expenses, and that's more continuing to point out the differences between how we run the company, et cetera. And we'll continue to, as we look at the next year's test fashion. There's not a lot we can do on the loan book and stuff. It's the best in the business as dictated by their results. So it's going to be more on convincing on operating expenses and operational losses and things like that over time. Operator : We can go now to Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets. Brian. Gerard Cassidy : Can you guys share with me -- if you look at your deposits at the end -- or the average deposits in your fourth quarter of '19, I think they totaled about $1.4 trillion. Today, you have $2 trillion. And granted consumer has grown very nicely, as you pointed out, Brian, I think it's up $358 billion over that time period. Can you share with us your color or your guys' outlook on as quantitative tightening goes into full speed of $95 billion or so a month, how do you think that could affect your balance sheet as you look out over the next 12 to 18 months? Alastair Borthwick : Well, we're obviously curious with that trajectory as well. We haven't seen any great shift yet in deposits. This second quarter was largely just a return to the normal second quarter seasonality we see. We didn't see the last 2 years because there was pandemic cash inflow, fiscal monetary stimulus. And this quarter, it was probably a little more elevated. You saw the headlines talking about tax receipts this year were bigger than normal. So we felt that. But we haven't seen a great deal of impact from QT just yet. And it feels like our customers still want to hold a pretty healthy deposit balance. So I think it's natural to think about -- go back to Q4 '19, you think about the fact that the economy is bigger. You think about the fact that the monetary base is bigger. So there's probably a floor, but we'll be watching things from here in the same way that you are. Brian Moynihan : Gerard, we can't really go widdershins against the market here because at the end of the day, that growth affects the monetary accommodation, the physical stimulus, et cetera. But remember, as you're thinking about that 1.4, 1.5 and today 1.9 to 2, you do have to remember that it's 3 years and with inflation and the economy is bigger, it was a  economy back then, I think it's 25-ish now. So you got to kind of not only put your normal growth rate, which you mentioned, but you also got to add to that sort of the size of the economy and our market share because DDR deposits reflect the economy moving in and out of the system and across different -- as you have money movement from consumers to businesses, businesses consumers as paychecks and stuff. So I think I'd be careful just saying, \"Oh, let's go back to normalized growth rate off that, you have 2% GDP and 2%, 3% because you're missing that there's a step up in size that we picked up and kept and we grew market share.\" So it will be higher. We know that, but there will be some impact from monetary tightening or else it wouldn't occur and it wouldn't be the way the Fed actually controls the economy to some degree. Gerard Cassidy : : Brian Moynihan : Gerard, we don't manage that number -- we manage the liquidity resources and leave that aside. But we have a deposit business that generates deposits from customers, not from pricing and not from going into sort of broker deposits or secondary markets. These are all core deposits coming in from core customers. So that dictates our overall size. Then we turn around and make loans to the customers based on the credit standards and capabilities we have in their demand for credit, and that turns into $1 trillion of loans. And so it's not a number Alastair or I or others at the top of the house, say, if that number is 62, it's good and the 50, it's bad. It's just it is a result of running the customer franchise. The amount of liquidity we have, that is much more planned, obviously, and planned by the microsecond every day. And you can see that our ratios and stuff over the course of time far in excess of what we need. And that will come back down. That's probably going to be more apt to come down as part of the monetary tightening process and things like that. But that's basically what we're doing now to manage the capital of all this is taking RWA lower -- 20% RWA assets and moving them into zero RWA to help that and give the rooms -- the business to have more room to grow the core loan book, but we never managed to a precise number. We let the businesses operate and then we balance the interest rate risk and the capital questions and the liquidity question at the top of the house, but it works pretty well right now. Alastair Borthwick : And if you just look at the last couple of quarters -- if you just look at the last 2 quarters, you sort of see as the loans growth has continued to return, as the securities have matured and prepaid, we've just taken some of that liquidity and put it against loans. Because remember, that would always be our first choice even in pandemic. It's just that the loans growth wasn't there. It's back. So we're using those securities and replacing them with higher-yielding loans. Operator : We'll take our final question today from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Ken Usdin : Just a couple of follow-ups on the balance sheet. So just following up on the deposit side, Alastair, in your prepared remarks, you talked about modest growth in loans, modest -- and deposits from here. So I'm just wondering, should we be thinking about when you talk about modest growth in deposits, that off of your period end balance when you think about that after we get past this tax seasonality? Brian Moynihan : Yes, think about period end because that's where we are. We've seen the deposits in the first few weeks of July, will be relatively stable. But yes, you got to go off a period end because that's what you got. There's some fluctuations as you get the month end and all that stuff as you well know, but that's where we start from. Alastair Borthwick : And Q3 and Q4 seasonally tend to be the place where we build deposits. Ken Usdin : Yes. Okay. And then on the NII side -- sorry, on the loan growth side, again, obviously, you're putting up very strong results as a big industry, especially in commercial and in card. Can you just talk about you're thinking in terms of how loan growth looks in the second half relative to the last couple of quarters? And any changes you're just sensing good or bad within the customer base and across the various loan buckets? Alastair Borthwick : Well, not a tremendous amount of change. We've had good loan growth. We anticipate we'll see good loans growth. That said, obviously, full year, we're kind of at 12%. We said we thought that we'd have mid- to high single digits. That's kind of what we're still expecting is mid- to high single digits. There are a couple of places where, for example, our mortgage pipeline is done just with higher rates. I think it'd be natural to think that in some areas where other areas like securities-based lending, as rates go up, that might damage some loans demand there. And it feels like business leaders may talk themselves into less confidence. So that may dampen loans growth. But as of right now, we think it's still in that kind of mid- to high single digits. Ken Usdin : Got it. And then just one clean-up, last clean-up here. Premium am was about a $300 million helper to $0.6 billion. How much more improvement could you see? And is that built into your expectation for third and fourth quarter? Alastair Borthwick : Yes. It's built in. It will keep going down, obviously, as rates go up, but it's going to -- it's not a linear relationship. It's more curved. So it's -- and it's -- our expectations are all built into our NII guidance. Brian Moynihan : There seeing no more questions, let me just close by thanking you for your time and attention. As you think about Bank of America for the second quarter of 2022, as we said earlier, the pre-pandemic growth engine has kicked back in. We're mindful of the debate about a future recession, and we have prepared the company across the last decade-plus through responsible growth to be prepared for that. But as we see our current customer base, we are not seeing them slowdown in terms of their activities. So the story is one of organic growth with operating leverage driven by -- and using our capital wisely. Thank you. Operator : This does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.",

Please note, this call may be recorded, and I'll be standing by if you should need any assistance.  It is now my pleasure to turn today's program over to Lee McEntire. Please go ahead. Lee McEntire : Thank you, Kathrin. Good morning. Welcome, I hope everyone had a good weekend. Thank you for joining the call to review our third quarter results. I hope everyone also had a chance to review our earnings documents released earlier this morning. As always, they're available, including the earnings presentation that Brian and Alastair will refer to during the call, on the Investor Relations section of the bankofamerica.com website. I'm going to first turn the call over to our CEO, Brian Moynihan, for some opening comments, and then I'll ask Alastair Borthwick, our CFO, to cover the details of the quarter. Before I turn the call over to Brian, I'll just remind you that we may make some forward-looking statements, and refer to non-GAAP financial measures during the call. Forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and assumptions, and they are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to materially differ from expectations are detailed in our earnings materials and the SEC filings that are available on the website. Information about non-GAAP financial measures, including reconciliations to U.S. GAAP, can also be found in our earnings materials that are available on the website and in the docs. So with that, I'll turn it over to you, Brian. Thank you Brian Moynihan : Good morning, and thank you for joining us. I want to start by sending our thoughts to the impacted areas from the devastation of the recent storms, especially our impacted teammates and their families. Our teams remain busy assisting those clients and associates in the impacted areas. So we're going to start on Slide 2 of the earnings materials. This quarter, Bank of America reported $7.1 billion in net income or $0.81 per diluted share. We grew revenue 8% year-over-year. We delivered our fifth straight quarter of operating leverage. Every business segment delivered operating leverage. This takes us back to our five-year run before the pandemic. The highlights this quarter were also once again marked by good organic customer activity. This was coupled with a significant increase in net interest income.  In addition, the teams adapted well to our new capital requirements. And as a result, our common equity tier 1 ratio or CET1 ratio improved by nearly 50 basis points to 11%, moving 60 basis points above its current minimums. The decline from prior year reported net income and EPS comparisons reflect a reserve build versus a reserve release last year. At the same time, however, our asset quality remains strong as net charge-offs and several other metrics, in fact, improved from the second quarter 2022. Pretax pre-provision income grew 10% year-over-year. From a return perspective, we produced a 15% ROTCE and a 90 basis point ROA. Our efficiency ratio this quarter dropped to 62%. Taking out the litigation, it would have been 61%. So even while investing in marketing and people and technology and physical plan, the team continues to drive operational excellence. An easy way to think about this is we currently operate Bank of America with less people than we had in 2015, seven years ago. Let's go to Slide 3. Those continued investments over the past several years in our people, tools and resources for our customers and teammates, as well as our new and renovated financial centers have allowed us to continually enhance the customer experience and fuel organic growth as we drive responsible growth. In the third quarter alone, we added more than 400,000 plus net new consumer checking accounts. We added 1.3 million new credit card accounts. We added 100,000 new funded investment accounts in our Consumer business. Customers are finding an increasingly convenient access to us. Digital users grew to 56 million. Logins by those users cleared 3 billion in the past quarter, 1 billion per month. Erica surpassed 1 billion interactions since it was introduced four years ago this quarter. It has become a primary interaction method for our clients with more than 130 million interactions this quarter alone. When you look at our sales, 48% of third quarter sales were digital, a 36% year-over-year increase. This occurred even as we fully reopened our financial centers and had our teammates also selling. Now once again, you can find all these digital statistics and more in the appendix of our earnings material as usual. I encourage you look at those statistics for every one of lines of business, not just Consumer. They compare favorably to the competitive measures that we see because when we see people actually publish their numbers. At the same time, 27 million customers visit our financial center in the quarter. This highlights the importance of having both high-touch and high-tech approach.  In the wealth management business, we added 400 advisors this quarter. Our advisors added nearly 6,000 new households in the Merrill and Private Bank areas. We saw solid net flows despite the turbulence of markets. 80% of our GWIM customers are digitally active. 30% of the new Merrill accounts are open digitally. That combined with our consumer investments business has seen more than $100 billion of net client flows year-to-date. We continue to see increased activity both in investments as well as the banking products in this area. This quarter, GWIM opened a record number of bank accounts. GWIM also saw its 50th consecutive quarter of average loan growth. The banking capabilities and success differentiates our platform. The business grew revenue, delivered operating leverage and saw a record pretax pre-provision growth, even in choppy markets. As we turn to Global Banking, ending loan balances were down linked quarter. However, we did see solid production in this area, and that was offset by client paydowns, decreasing the value of foreign denominated loans and loans sold to manage our risk-weighted assets, which helped us build the capital levels I talked about earlier.  As we look at Global Markets, the team had a strong third quarter in sales and trading performance. In fact, in the third quarter of 2022 was the strongest since the third quarter of 2010. It grew 13% from last year. It was led by strong performance in our macro FICC business, which has benefited by investments made over the past year. We had no trading loss days this quarter.  Let me also make a few points using the customer activity highlighted on the continued resilience of Bank of America's broad customer base. So if you look at Slide 4, you can see some points about the overall health that demonstrate what's going on in the customer base. Let me make a couple of key points. First, consumers continue to spend at strong levels. Second, Consumer customer average deposit levels for September 2022 remain at multiples of the pre-pandemic levels. You can see that in the lower right. Third, there's plenty of capacity for borrowing as credit and card balances of BAC are still 12% both pre-pandemic levels, and the payment rates on those credit cards are 1,000 basis points over pre-pandemic levels. So in spending, a couple of thoughts. A perspicacious analyst might wonder whether talk of inflation, recession and other factors would fructify in a slower spending growth. We just don't see here at Bank of America. Year-to-date spending of $3.1 trillion through September is up 12% compared to last year. Second, as you look across the period, you can see in the trend of year-over-year spending. As we entered the pandemic, we saw spending decline and click or recover and grow across the quarters. And while still strong in September 10%, spending growth has slowed just a bit from the 12% year-to-date pace, which shows you that early in the year was a faster year-over-year growth rate, but still strong. And the first two weeks of October show that strength is still growing at 10%. It\u2019s notable that isn't just inflation that is driving spending as transactions are up single digits year-over-year pretty consistently. You'll also note on the bottom left, the continued growth in goods and services, particularly retail toward experiences of travel and entertainment. While fuel price volatility continues, it is not currently impacting the spend levels in this quarter as prices stabilize. On a level of customer liquidity -- the level of customer liquidity remains strong. Average deposit balances of our Consumer customer remained at high levels relative to a year ago. These balances are still multiples of the pre-pandemic periods, and they were largely unchanged at these elevated amounts for the month of September. These deposit levels suggest continued capacity to strengthen at healthy levels.  On Slide 5, we show you as we did last quarter, some other stats about resiliency. As you can see, whether you look at early or late-stage card delinquencies, they all remain well below our pre-pandemic levels. These are decades-old lows, and we're just now seeing gradual move off these lows and early-stage delinquencies. Late-stage delinquencies are still 40% below pre-pandemic levels. Keep in mind, asset quality metrics were strong even before the pandemic.  On this page, what you see is a 30 to 90 day card delinquencies. If you compare them against the average for the past five years leading up to the pandemic, a period of growth and unemployment falling, those averages were 183 basis points and 91 basis points, respectively. So the current ratio of delinquencies have to be worse than 30% or more to even approach that five-year pre-pandemic average at a time of economic growth and falling unemployment. So consumers remain resilient. Let me take a couple of minutes to talk to you quickly about the balance sheet, and I'll turn it over to Alastair. As you think about loan and deposit base balances in general, we're seeing what we expected, as monetary policy tightens. On deposits, we see clients with excess liquidity looking for yield without being the global banking movements you can see from moving from noninterest-bearing to interest-bearing accounts. Or in our Wealth Management business, where we saw clients shift out of brokerage sweeps into preferred deposits or other investment products like treasuries that we offer. But if you look at our core customer base, where the transactional balances drive the outcome, we are seeing steady balances driven by new account activity and a good value proposition we have for our customers. When you think about loans, consumer loan balance growth was led by card and reflects increased market and continued reopening of financial centers, building high levels of new customer relationships. On commercial, the average loans rose $16 billion linked quarter or 12% annualized. We did see a modest and balanced decline as good loan production was offset by the sale or syndication of $3 billion of loans and also by $4 billion in negative foreign currency impacts. We obviously took activity on balance sheet optimization, which helped our RWA -- discussion -- helped our RWAs and led to the capital levels I talked about earlier. We have provided an update in the appendix as to the credit transformation of our loan portfolio and a few other consumer credit slides to help illustrate the quality of our portfolio under years of responsible growth. We updated those slides again this quarter to show you them and you can find in the appendix, and I recommend them to you. So in summary, client activity remains good. NII has improved quickly and the customers' resilience and health remains strong. We've also managed our expenses very well. We drove our operating leverage. The team managed the balance sheet well and improved capital, either increased our dividend and bought back a modest amount of shares. We call that responsible growth. With that, I'll turn it over to Alastair. Alastair Borthwick : Thank you, Brian. And I'll start by adding a little more detail on the income statement and refer you to Slide 6 highlights. You can see here revenue of $24.5 billion grew 8% and with NII improving 24% year-over-year, while our fees declined 8%. And I'll cover the NII improvement in just a moment.  On noninterest income, the volatility and the levels of market activity drove a year-over-year decline in investment banking and asset management fees, while still some trading benefited from investments made in the business and the volatile market conditions. Additionally, service charges moved lower for two reasons. First, in Consumer, we completed the sweeping changes around insufficient funds and overdraft in June, marking a 90% reduction from June of 2021. Second, our corporate service charges declined as earned credit rates increased for clients and that overwhelmed organic growth in the gross fees associated with treasury management services performed for our clients. Expenses this quarter were $15.3 billion, and they included the settlement of our last large remaining legacy monoline insurance litigation. As you likely saw on October 7, we filed the 8-K announcing a settlement that resolved all of the outstanding litigation with Ambac and that dates all the way back to the 2008 financial crisis. We recorded $354 million in litigation expense this quarter above previous accruals for payment of the settlement. And without that litigation cost, our expense would have been just below the $15 billion mark. Okay. Let's move to the balance sheet and we'll look at Slide 7, where you can see during the quarter, the balance sheet declined $38 billion to $3.07 trillion. That was driven by a $46 billion decline in deposits and coupled with a $53 billion decline in securities. Our average liquidity portfolio declined in the quarter reflecting the decrease in deposits and security levels. At $941 billion, our liquidity still remains $365 billion above pre-pandemic levels, just to give you an idea of just how much our liquidity has increased. Shareholders' equity was stable with the second quarter at $270 billion as earnings were offset by capital distributed to shareholders and the change in AOCI from rate moves. We paid out $1.8 billion in common dividends. We bought back $450 million in gross share repurchases, and that covered our employee issuances in the quarter, leaving no dilutive impact for shareholders.  AOCI declined $4.4 billion as a result of the increase in loan rates, and we saw the impact primarily in two ways. First, we had a reduction from a change in the value of our AFS debt securities. That was 1.1 billion, and that impacted CET1. Second, rates also drove a $3.7 billion decline in AOCI from derivatives, and that does not impact CET1. That reflects cash flow hedges mostly put in place last year against some of our variable rate loans, and that protected us against CET1. With regard to regulatory capital, our supplemental leverage ratio increased to 5.8% versus our minimum requirement of 5%, which still leaves plenty of capacity for balance sheet growth and our TLAC ratio remains comfortably above our requirements. Okay. Let's go to CET1 waterfall on Slide 8, and we can talk about that. As you'll recall back in -- last quarter, we talked about our June CCAR results, where our stress capital buffer increased from 2.5% to 3.4%. And that increased our overall CET1 ratio minimum requirement from 9.5 to 10.4 as of the beginning of the fourth quarter. Our capital levels today remain strong with $176 billion of CET1. And through the good work of our teams, we improved our CET1 ratio by 49 basis points compared to June 30, taking us to 11%. That leaves us well above our new 10.4% minimum requirement. So we'll walk through the drivers this quarter. First, it's $6.6 billion of earnings, net of preferred dividends and that generated 40 basis points of capital. And then also importantly, through optimization of the balance sheet, we managed our RWA balances down and that added 26 basis points more of capital ratio improvement. Dividends used 11 basis points of capital. And this quarter, the movement in treasury and mortgage-backed securities rates caused the fair value of our AFS debt securities to decrease, and that lowered our CET1 ratio by 7 basis points.  We remain well positioned for the rate movement because of the hedge of a large portion of this portfolio continuing to protect us from AOCI movements while benefiting NII since float -- since swap to floating. So we feel like our teams rose to the challenge well this quarter in terms of increased capital requirements.  On Slide 9, we've laid out average loans. And looking at those loans and providing a bit more detail on a year-over-year basis, you can see 12% average growth as commercial loans grew 17% and consumer loans grew 7%. Within Consumer, credit card grew 12%. Focusing on more near-term growth versus the second quarter of '22, our average total loans grew 8% on an annualized basis, led by 12% annualized commercial loan growth and 21% annualized credit card growth, while other consumer loans were relatively flat linked quarter. This slower loan quarter growth included two notable impacts that Brian mentioned. We saw good commercial loan demand, and we also saw FX valuations adjustments as a result of the strong dollar and then some loan sales and syndications that lowered our RWAs. Partially offsetting some of the strong card growth in consumer loans, we sold about $1 billion of residential mortgage loans. Adjusting for the FX impact and loan sales, loan growth from Q2 was closer to the industry's growth rate. Let's focus now on deposits use on Slide 10. And you can see there that our average deposits year-over-year are up 1% at $1.96 trillion. The noninterest-bearing deposits are down 3%, while the interest-bearing are up 4%. So overall, we grew our deposits. And as you would expect in a rising rate environment, we've seen some shifts from noninterest-bearing into interest-bearing, and it's important to understand the makeup of these moves.  In Consumer, our total deposits are up 7% year-over-year. These are core and foundational elements of the customers' financial activities. And we've seen growth in both noninterest-bearing and interest-bearing balances and we remain very disciplined on $1.1 trillion of total consumer deposits while Fed funds is now at 3.25. So customers see the value in their total relationship with us through their personalized client engagement and our industry-leading digital capabilities and rewards. We expect that to continue.  Do we expect deposit rates to increase? Yes, of course, and we will remain both disciplined and competitive, and that is built into our asset sensitivity. On a linked quarter basis, our consumer deposits moved lower by less than 1%.  In Wealth Management, total deposits are flat year-over-year. And again, it's important to understand that as expected, these are the clients who generally have more excess liquidity and have historically saw higher rates, both in deposit accounts as well as movements outside of deposits where we offer alternatives for those clients. While flat year-over-year, within that, we saw a $12 billion decline in year-over-year average deposits on our brokerage platform with some shifts from sweeps to preferred deposits within the platform. Meanwhile, Merrill Bank deposits and deposits with Private Bank have grown $12 billion. The higher-tiered preferred deposit products represent a little more than 20% of the mix of deposits and they're moving largely in line with short-term rates, while the other 80% or so deposit products are paying much lower rates. On a linked quarter basis, we saw total GWIM deposits decline by 7%, further highlighting these trends.  In Global Banking, we hold about $500 billion in customer deposits, and we saw a 7% year-over-year decline. In a rising rate environment, where excess balances can be more expensive, we typically see some runoff, particularly in high liquidity environments as clients both use cash for inventory build and begin to manage their cash for yield. And we've seen the mix of interest-bearing deposits move from 30% a year ago to nearly 35%, and we're paying an increased rate on those interest-bearing deposits. Pricing is largely customer-by-customer based on the depth of relationship and many other factors. And again, we're not really seeing anything unexpected here.  Betas at this point are still favorable to the last cycle. And as we would just note, relative to the last cycle, the Fed increases have been pretty rapid, and we'd expect to pay higher rates as we continue to move through this rate cycle. It's probably too early to say right now if at the end of that cycle, the percentage of those rate pass-throughs will be similar to the last cycle. Turning to Slide 11 and net interest income. On a GAAP non-FTE basis, NII in Q3 was $13.8 billion, and the FTE NII number is $13.9 million. Focusing on FTE, net interest income increased $2.7 billion from Q3 '21 or 24%, and that's driven by benefits from higher interest rates, including lower premium amortization and from loan growth. Versus the second quarter, NII is up $1.3 billion, driven largely by the same factors, plus an additional day of interest in the quarter. Year-over-year now, average short-term interest rates have increased 200-plus basis points, driving up the interest earned on our variable rate assets while we've maintained discipline on our deposit pricing, and that has driven nearly $1 billion of improvement. Long-term interest rates on mortgages have increased even more than short-term rates, and that's improving fixed rate asset replacement and driving down refinancing of mortgage assets, therefore, slowing the recognition of premium amortization recognized in our securities portfolio. Year-over-year, that premium amortization has improved $1 billion. And additionally, lower securities balances over the past six months modestly offset the benefits of year-over-year loan growth. The net interest yield was 2.06% and that improved 38 basis points from the third quarter of '21. 20 basis points of that improvement occurred in the most recent quarter. And as you will note, excluding Global Markets activities, our net interest yield was 2.51% this quarter.  Looking forward, as it relates to NII guidance, I'd like to make a couple of comments. And first, I need to make a couple of caveats. Our guidance is going to assume interest rates in the most recent forward curve and that they materialize, that we see modest loan growth and modest deposit balance changes with market-based deposit pricing increasing baked in. With that said, we expect NII in Q4 to be at least $1.25 billion higher than Q3. So last quarter when we were together, we told you we expected to see consecutive NII increases of about $1 billion in Q3 and another $1 billion in Q4. And that would make a total of $2 billion in Q3 and Q4, given we just put up $1.3 billion in Q3 and that outperformance, and refreshing our expectation for Q4 at $1.25 billion. We're now saying that aggregate quarterly improvement won't be the $2 billion we initially thought, it's increased to around $2.6 billion or more. Turning to asset sensitivity and focusing on a forward yield basis. At September 30, declined $0.7 billion to $4.2 billion of expected NII over the next 12 months, with now roughly 95% of the sensitivity driven by short rates. And on a spot basis, our sensitivity to 100 basis point instantaneous rate hike would be $5.3 billion. Okay. Let's turn to expense, and we'll use Slide 12 for the discussion. Third quarter expenses were $15.3 billion and were flat with the second quarter as litigation costs for our settlement in Q3 nearly offset the fines agreed to last quarter on a comparative basis. And it's nice to bring resolution to these matters. Without the costs associated with the resolutions in both periods, expenses would have been just less than $15 billion. We continue to make steady investments in our people, technology, marketing and financial centers. And what allows us to help pay for these investments are the operational process improvements we've talked about and the increased digital adoption rates by our customers and by our bankers. Our headcount this quarter increased by 3,500. And if we adjust for the release of our summer interns, our headcount is actually up by closer to 5,500. We welcomed 1,800 new full-time associates from college campuses around the world into our company this quarter and we hired another 3,800 net new people on top of that. That included just less than 3,000 across our various lines of business and another 1,000 in staff and support and technology positions to support those lines of business. And with all the great benefits and talented people already at this company and with our great brand, it highlights that Bank of America is a great place to work. As we look forward, we'd expect our fourth quarter expenses will land our full year reported expense at approximately $61 billion. That obviously includes the cost noted for resolving the second quarter and third quarter regulatory and litigation matters. So without that, our expenses are expected to be a little more than the $60 billion level we talked about earlier in the year. And we're proud of our team's discipline around expense particularly in this inflationary environment, while at the same time, we're modestly increasing our level of investment in the company's future and our growth.  Turning to asset quality on Slide 13, and I want to start by saying just as Brian did that asset quality of our customers remains very healthy. The net charge-offs of $520 million declined $51 million from the second quarter. That decline was driven by prior period charge-offs associated with the sale of some noncore mortgage loans we discussed last quarter. Absent those losses, net charge-offs were relatively stable with the prior period. Provision expense was $898 million in the third quarter, and that was $375 million higher than the second quarter. And we built $378 million of reserve in the period compared to a modest release in Q2. The reserve build in the quarter primarily reflects good credit card loan growth and a dampened macroeconomic outlook. Even as we build our reserves for the future, this quarter, we saw many of our asset quality metrics continue to show modest improvement as NPLs and reservable criticized both declined from Q2, and you can see that in the supplement.  On Slide 14, we highlight the credit quality metrics for both our Consumer and Commercial portfolios. And there's only one point I want to make, looking at this slide and that is delinquencies because our consumer delinquencies remain well below pre-pandemic levels. And as Brian noted earlier, we're watching closely the early-stage card delinquencies as they begin to increase modestly. Lastly, the recent Hurricane Ian impacted some areas where we have strong market shares for many of our businesses, and our teams have spent the past days assessing the damages and insurance coverage down to the loan level. And we've already incorporated that analysis into our reserves for the quarter. We compared our analysis to other large storms in recent years like Sandy, Harvey and Irma where we incurred just a small amount of financial losses.  Turning to the business segments, let's start with Consumer Banking on Slide 15. And Brian shared earlier, we've got organic growth across the checking accounts, the card accounts and investments picking up this quarter, not necessarily because of anything we're doing differently in the past 90 days, but as a result of many years of retooling and continuously investing in the business. We have the leading retail deposit market share. We have leadership positions among all of the important products. We're the leading digital bank with tremendous convenience capabilities for consumer and small business clients. We've got a leading online consumer investment platform and the best small business platform offering for our clients. So as a result, customer satisfaction is now at all-time highs, and that is helping us to drive strong financial results. The Consumer Bank earned $3.1 billion on good organic growth and delivered its sixth consecutive quarter of operating leverage while we continued heavy investments for the future. The impact of strong year-over-year revenue growth of 12% was partially offset by an increase in provision expense. And the provision increase reflected reserve builds this period, mostly for card growth versus a reserve release in the third quarter of '21. Our net charge-offs remain low and stable. While our reported earnings were only modestly up year-over-year, pretax pre-provision income grew 12% year-over-year which highlights the earnings improvement coming through without the impact of the reserve actions. Card revenue was solid and increased modestly year-over-year as spending benefits were mostly offset by higher rewards costs. Service charges were down $338 million year-over-year as our insufficient funds and overdraft policy changes were in full effect now by the end of Q2. And because of the scale of the business and the diverse revenue, we fully absorbed that revenue impact and are now more benefiting from the benefits of overall customer satisfaction, lower attrition in our client base and lower cost associated with fewer customer complaint calls associated with less nuisance fees. Expense increased 11% from business investments for growth, including people, digital and marketing along with costs related to opening the business to fuller capacity. Much of the company's increased salary and wage moves in the quarter impact Consumer Banking the most. We also continued our investment in financial centers, opening another 16 in the quarter while we renovated nearly 200 more. Both digital banking and operational process improvements are helping to pay for those investments. And as revenue grew, we've improved the efficiency ratio to 51%.  Moving to Slide 16. Wealth Management produced strong results, earning $1.2 billion, and that's a particularly strong result given both equity and bond market levels. If they remain unchanged for the rest of the year, this would be only the first time since 1976 that both equity and bond markets were down for the year. Now the volatility and generally lower market levels have put pressure on revenue in this business. And what's helping to differentiate Merrill and Private Bank right now is a strong banking business; in this case, to the tune of $339 billion of deposits and $224 billion of loans. So while many of our brokerage peers faced declines in revenue and margin, we've seen year-over-year revenue growth of 2% and a margin of 29%, driving the sixth straight quarter of operating leverage. And we saw enough revenue growth from banking products in Q3 that more than offset declines in assets under management and brokerage fees. Our talented group of financial advisors, coupled with our powerful digital capabilities, allowed modern Merrill to gain 5,200 net new households and the Private Bank gained 550 more in the quarter, both up nicely from net household generation in 2021. We added $24 billion of loans since Q3 of '21, growing 12% and this marked our 50th consecutive quarter of average loans growth in the business, consistent and sustained performance. Assets under management flows were $4 billion in the quarter and $42 billion since this time last year. Expenses increased 2%, driven by continued client facing hiring and higher other employee-related costs as our advisors are increasing their in-person engagement with clients, and that's partially offset by lower revenue-related incentives. On Slide 17, you'll see our Global Banking results, where we earned $2 billion in Q3 on strong revenue growth as higher NII more than offset lower noninterest income. Earnings were down year-over-year, driven in large part by the absence of a prior period reserve release. Our 7% revenue growth is quite healthy given the more than 40% decline in investment banking fees, coupled with lower leasing revenue. While the company's overall investment banking fees declined $1 billion year-over-year in a continued tough market, investment banking fees did improve modestly from Q2 and the teams did a nice job of holding on to our number three ranking in overall fees in a tough environment. Otherwise, in fees, we saw a decline in corporate service charges as enterprise credit rates rose with increased rates, and that outpaced the growth in gross treasury service fees generated from new and existing clients. I'd also remind you that GTS benefits greatly from the NII off of deposits that more than offsets this. So our year-over-year total GTS revenue was up 44%. We also had lower leasing related revenue comparatively. The provision expense increase reflected a reserve build of $144 million in Q3 '22 compared to a $789 million release in the year ago period. And with regard to expenses, they increased 5% year-over-year, driven by continued investments in the business. For example, in Commercial Banking, our strategic hiring over the years has just continued to increase our quality and prospect [calling] efforts. Switching to Global Markets on Slide 18. And as we usually do, we'll talk about segment results, excluding DVA. Inflation, continued geopolitical tensions and the changing monetary policies of central banks around the world continue to drive volatility in both the bond and equity markets. As a result, it's another quarter that favored macro trading while credit trading businesses faced the continued challenging market environment with wider spreads and recession concerns. So the third quarter net income of $1.1 billion reflects a good quarter of sales and trading revenue. Focusing on year-over-year, sales and trading contributed $4.1 billion to revenue, improving 13%. FICC improved 27% while equities declined 4%. The FICC improvement was primarily driven by growth in our macro products, while our credit traded products were down. And we've been investing heavily over the past year in several macro businesses that we identified as opportunities for us, and we were rewarded this quarter. The decline in equities was driven by lower client activity in Asia and a weaker performance in cash, partially offset by good performance in derivatives where we saw increased client activity. Year-over-year expense declined, reflecting the absence of costs associated with the realignment of liquidating business activity that we took in the fourth quarter of '21, and the business generated a 10% return in the third quarter. Finally, on Slide 19, we show All Other, which reported a loss of $281 million, declining from the year ago period, driven by the litigation settlement that I noted earlier and higher tax expense. On income tax expense, I just want to mention one thing that made our tax rate a little higher this quarter, and that is with the recent passage of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. Among other things it incorporated, there is a change that allowed solar energy investments to elect production tax credits versus upfront investment tax credits. And those production tax credits have the potential to earn more credits over the expected life of the production facility. So as a result, our third quarter tax expense is approximately $150 million higher due to the net reversal of tax credits accrued for 2022 solar deals taken in the first half of 2022 that were recognized under initial investment tax credits at the time and we were placed with production tax credits. So a little impact this quarter but net benefit to the shareholder over time. This drove the effective tax rate a little higher this quarter to more than 14%, still obviously benefiting from our ESG investment tax credits. And excluding the impact of ESG tax credits, tax rate would have been approximately 24%. Given the change noted for solar investments, we expect the fourth quarter tax rate to be similar to the third quarter tax rate and we\u2019ll examine the further effects of these changes and how they impact full year 2023 and report on that next quarter. And with that, I'm going to stop there and open it for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question today from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global. James Mitchell : Maybe just on NII. I think there's a lot of uncertainty around deposit behavior, betas, what the catch-up rate could be with deposit pricing. But you guys indicated that you do -- you're still pretty asset sensitive. So how do you think about the trajectory of NII next year? Can it kind of keep growing from sort of the Q4 level through next year? Brian Moynihan : Thanks\u2026 James Mitchell : Assuming forward curve is realized? Sorry. Brian Moynihan : Yes. Yes. So the short answer is yes, we believe so. And we believe that really for three reasons. The first one is, we still expect for future rate hikes and there's going to be some lag to their impact. So you'll start to feel some of that in Q1, for example, for the late hikes in this quarter. Second, we're anticipating -- loans growth is still pretty good at this stage. So we're anticipating that we'll keep growing on the loan side. And then third, we've got an opportunity to restrike our balance sheet at higher rates with every opportunity now as things come off of our existing securities portfolio. So look, we've got our assumptions in there to be competitive on deposit pricing in each of the various segments. But yes, we believe we'll grow NII next year. James Mitchell : On 4Q run rates. Brian Moynihan : Yes. Correct. James Mitchell : Okay. And then maybe as a follow-up, you guys have done a pretty great job on hedging AOCI risk and the AFS book. My understanding is that the -- those are sort of delayed start swaps. Is there a material benefit coming from those swaps in the fourth quarter and beyond, how we think about? Alastair Borthwick : Just the way our own ALM projected over the course of the next couple of years, we had some forward starting swaps. Those are going to pay us floating in the fourth quarter, and that's a contributor to the NII growth in the fourth quarter but I think we should assume a little bit third quarter, most all in the fourth quarter, and that's probably it. Operator : We'll go next to Erika Najarian with UBS. Erika Najarian : I just wanted to ask a question about expenses. I think part of various theses on the stock is that various investors expect some sort of expense catch up relative to how your closest peer -- one of your closest peers is budgeting expenses for not just this year but next year. Heard you loud and clear on the $61 billion, plus the litigation settlement for full year 2022. But as we think about coming years and think about the investments that you've made, you've highlighted the headcount additions in the third quarter, will the expectation of 1% to 2% expense growth still hold as we look forward? Or these inflation and investments change that range upward? Brian Moynihan : So Erika, we continue to invest heavily along multiple dimensions, people, technology restructuring all the physical plant, marketing. And so -- but yes, through the core operational excellence, discipline this company has and has shown, as I said earlier, seven years later, we have the same number of people. The company is a lot bigger than it was in 2015. And so we continue to reposition money from things we can eliminate the work by the engineering and work and the technology investments that we make enabling the customer uses that technology and pile back into the production side of the company. And so we don't -- I think if you think about just this year's third quarter '22 versus third quarter '21, if you take out the litigation, there's about $600 million increase in expenses year-over-year, $100 million of that is marketing. Another chunk is -- another couple of hundred million dollars is technology. This is quarterly, not annually, quarterly numbers. And then on top of that, the amount of physical plant change in that time is huge, not only in our branches, but all over our company.  So we feel strong. We continue to increase investments, technology will go up 15% this year versus being '23 versus '20 and those expense numbers we're giving you, but we pay for it by not investing and hoping something happens. We expect the things to fructify in near term and bring forward the fruit and drive the expense efficiencies and effectiveness. And that's how we can take the managers in that time period I gave you the headcount slot, the managers came down 10,000 people in that period of time. We invested all in frontline people to help serve our clients. Erika Najarian : Got it. And my second question is on more significant buyback activity, Brian. I think that the CET1 build is certainly coming faster than I think The Street expected. And I'm wondering, do we need to see Bank of America get to that 11.4% before heavier buyback activity? Or do you think you could manage the heavier buyback activity as you build to that 11.4% CET1 by January 1, 2024? Brian Moynihan : So we bought back shares this quarter and still grew the capital. Our job is to drive our company to serve our customers in that first order of business for our capital has always helped the growth in the balance sheet, especially on the lending and market side. And so you should expect that buybacks will continue to increase. But remember, we are now sitting above what we are supposed to be sitting at on 1/1/2024. And so next year is already here. So obviously, the trade between building the buffer up a little bit more, as you said, from where we are now to [50] basis points over the requirement is a little bit different. We already exceeded the requirements. So we'll put a little bit towards the buffer. We'll support the organic growth a little bit towards a buffer and the use of rest to send back to you guys. Operator : We'll go next to Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Glenn Schorr : I'm curious, you -- as your capital build was -- thanks to RWA mitigation, you mentioned no loss days in the quarter despite all this market volatility. So I think you mentioned some loan sales. I don't know if that has to do some of the levered loans working off book. So I wonder if you could talk about RWA mitigation going forward and including that, what's left in delivered loan book to distribute? Alastair Borthwick : So there's a couple of things that are going on there. I don't want to confuse them. Let me first talk about the leverage financing. That we just marked through our numbers. It's in the numbers. We pushed it to do it every week. So that's included. When you look at those Global Markets or investment banking results, they include anything we are doing in investment banking. I don't think that's what Brian was referring to. What Brian was referring to is the RWA optimization that we're doing as a company to make sure that we're in a great place to serve our customers and to be in a position to have the flexibility for buybacks in the future. So a couple of things that we did there. We did sell some loans. You saw that in prior quarters in All Other. You can see some of the legacy loans were able to sell in prior quarters. This quarter, we sold $1 billion of loans in consumer and wealth and maybe $1 billion in Global Banking. So it's not big, but it's important for us just to make progress in different areas. And then most of the RWA optimization plan that we've been doing is pretty quiet. It's taking the securities that are 20% risk-weighted asset. And as they roll off -- and remember, there's like $15 billion of them roll off every quarter, we can replace those with treasuries at a higher yield. So we're getting more yield and we're reducing the RWAs with that.  And then the other thing I'd just say on RWA optimization is we probably tapped the brakes a little bit on loan production this quarter in a couple of places. And we did a little bit of CDS hedging here and there. And you'll see -- if you look at our numbers, you'll also see the Global Markets, just the way that the customers are demanding balance sheet, the balance sheet is still growing, but the RWAs are a little bit lower. So there's a lot that goes into RWAs, but it's a $1 billion here, $1 billion there. You add it all up, and it makes a difference. Glenn Schorr : It was awesome. I appreciate that. And I guess, very much related, you've just touched on it a little bit. But I'm curious, you\u2019re a prime and super prime bank in consumer lend, you gave us enough details. I know how you're thinking about growth there. On the commercial side, given what we're all facing in this potential real buzz of the economy, how do you approach risk and what business to take on? I don't know if you could include in that thought what kind of maturity wall you're looking at on the commercial side of the book? Brian Moynihan : Glenn, look, we always say to ourselves and what our teammates is that responsible growth across the last decade plus leads us to where we are. And so you're not going to do anything like this afternoon to change the impact. Candice and her team have negative growth this quarter, but the fourth quarter and the first couple of quarters next year, obviously negative growth. You're not going to change your portfolio overnight. So then the question is how do you manage it, right? So we have limits across all the different categories. You can see the spread of risk in the supplemental book. You can see that nobody is a big part of it. Then we look customer-by-customer and anticipate who is going to be needing money in terms of refinancing, but also in terms of just operating like we did during the pandemic in with every single loan, a company with $5 million of revenue more in our company on a quarterly basis for what I'm sure we had it. So we worked the construct of the book who we underwrite client selection, the structures of the deals, et cetera, in the spread of diversity among industries and U.S. versus non-U.S., et cetera. But then on top of that, we always work in the book hard, and our ratings integrity is very high. We can see it as measured in the [SNCs] and other things against a third party is very -- relatively have much to do than anything we have rated and we make sure we test that continuously with our credit review team under Christine Katziff and Geoff Greener's team because that, at the end of the day, make sure we're not fooling ourselves. And we continue to look at that. And frankly, I think this quarter, we still had upgrades exceeded downgrades. If you look at NPLs and reservable criticized, they both went down this quarter again. And so we're seeing improvement in the credit book even though all of the trade horribles that you\u2019ve sort of alluded to, and it wouldn't take a perspicacious person to lead to see that because it's in the paper every day. But right now, the credit continues to improve, but it's what we did over the last 12 years, 15 years of proof -- hold us in good stead as we head into this thing. Operator : The next question comes from John McDonald with Autonomous Research. John McDonald : I wanted to ask about the NII assumptions and maybe just your outlook around loan growth and what you're seeing in the economy, what you expect from loan growth? You mentioned modest. And then also, Alistair, just the pace of deposit mix shift and betas that you're kind of building into your outlook would be helpful. Alastair Borthwick : Well, on the loan side, I'd say we talked about at the beginning of the year that we thought loans would be high single digits, and we've slightly outperformed that, obviously. This quarter was a little bit of a 90-day reset for us in some ways. You didn't see that so much in consumer because the card growth just came through. And in commercial, certainly, we probably held up back just a touch. So we think we'll resume that sort of high single-digit, maybe mid if things begin to slow a little bit. So we've got that in our forecast, we sort of resume the path that we've been on.  With respect to deposits, I'd say on betas, obviously, we're just increasing those because we've got to be competitive in this environment. And around balances, I think there's a sense that the industry will be flattish, maybe down. We think we're going to outperform the industry ever so slightly. So that's what's largely baked into our assumptions at this stage. John McDonald : And in terms of funding the gap between the loan growth and flattish deposits, securities came down a fair amount this quarter. Can you continue to run down the securities portfolio? And what kind of volume do you get from cash flows off the book there? Alastair Borthwick : Yes. So the securities portfolio runs off at about $15 billion a quarter. It was a little more this quarter because we actually had an opportunity to sell some securities that offset some gains, some losses and freed up some RWAs. So we took advantage of that this quarter. And so the securities number this particular quarter was a little larger. But I think on an ongoing basis, John, you should assume that we've got $15 billion that just comes in. And then broadly, we've got $175 billion of cash at the Central Bank and we got another couple of hundred billion of stuff that's mostly treasury swap to floating. So we've got lots of ways to pay for loans growth in the future. John McDonald : Okay. If I could just clarify the discussion with Erika around expenses. The $61 billion this year includes the litigation. Did you say next year, you're kind of targeting low single-digit expense growth, would you say positive operating leverage? Brian Moynihan : Yes, I think we said at. Yes, it includes the litigation. And the next year, we said, yes, basically -- yes, this year includes litigation. The next year, we said at some point, we'll get back to the 1% to 2% rise. We'll just have to see how some of the ins and outs play in terms of some of the stuff running off this year still left over then. But look at the 15.3% for three quarters in a row. Honestly, each quarter has had a little bit of something in it. John, if you think about the first quarter when we had [FICA] and that type of stuff and the second quarter had regulatory [exempts to core] obligations. So we're bouncing around low 15s. We expect that run rate to kind of hold. Operator : We'll go next to Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Michael Mayo : I'd like a little bit more detail on how you add employees and resources for the additional revenues. From the second quarter to the third quarter, your profit margin on the new revenues was 100%. I mean, revenue is up $2 billion, expenses up zero. Clearly, that's not sustainable. But I would like you to, if you can tie that into Slide 22, more digital users and sales Zelle, Erica, 1 billion interactions. Your headcount is not growing a whole lot. How long can you keep that going? And theoretically, all this digitization over the past few years equates to like how many employees or how much in expenses or what's a terminal efficiency level relative to the past? Brian Moynihan : So I think, Mike, that's a lot of questions, but I'll try to sort out a little bit. Start with the last. There is no terminal efficiency ratio. Our idea is when you work on expenses, you're not working on the ratio, it ends up in a ratio. We work on the actual dollar spend and so we can keep working on investing heavily to drive that. And the digitization of all the operational process in the company is what you see on Slide 22 on the Consumer side. And you've seen it in the other slides on some of the wealth management and commercial operations still a lot of paper in the GTS business that we continue to take out. So that's what we're trying to do. But interesting enough, what's driving the near-term growth in employees has -- there's obviously financial advisor growth, you saw the $400 million this quarter that's investing in the training programs and hiring some people into the office, especially outside our footprint to get them grow. And again, there's investment in consumer -- commercial bankers. Those are not huge numbers, a big investment in the GCIB platform over the last year, I think 1,000 teammates the last couple of years. And so those investments come in, but also we're investing to drive the operational excellence platform and actually ensuring that we've got great customer service, dealing with all the things that go on. But a major part of it, frankly, is getting -- even though we have less branches year-over-year, less numbers of units, we have more people in them because we continue to build out the relationship management capabilities at branches. As you said on Page 22, the work goes out of the branches from a day-to-day sort of service things. We're putting more and more into relationship management. And that's why you see 400,000-plus net new checking households this quarter, which is a record for us going back to pre-financial crisis. We don't know how far back it is. If you look at small business originations are going up. If you look at merchant services sales, which -- that was an investment in sales force there, an investment. So it's just a combination of driving that. And the continued digitization allows us to continue to be efficient, effective and frankly, plow the money saved back in the marketing back into more technology to make us even more effective and then into people where we need them. But if Tom Scrivener runs our operations group, sees a lot of stuff ahead of he can take out. Bruce Thompson of the credit operations platform across all the businesses, a lot they can take out over time and we just go work on it. Alastair Borthwick : Mike, I think it's -- we don't necessarily translate it into that sort of idea of how many more people this digital replacer productivity metrics. But if you look at by different line of business, you just take consumer for a moment, if 50% of our consumer sales now are taking place digitally, you almost think about that being the equivalent of 4,000 more financial centers. And it turns out if you get 35 million people banking in the pocket with a mobile phone, makes a big difference. Michael Mayo : And then just a quick follow-up then. So Brian, you said before, the NII benefits have come barreling through to the benefit of investors. That was the case this quarter. Do you expect that to continue to be the case over the next year? Brian Moynihan : Yes. That's -- we said it last quarter and I hope that proved it true there to what you asked about last quarter. one thing Mike to think about is, go back and look at the consumer page in the deck, you'll see the cost of deposits, which is the overall cost of all the stuff against deposit basis continues to basically be 110 basis points, 120 basis points, which is down from 300 basis points 15 years ago. And that is extremely leverageable. And by the way, the profit margins on back up to 30% and drive them through it. So we're letting that NII pull through, which then drives those numbers in. Michael Mayo : And then one quick follow-up. Just I ask this for someone else if they didn't really know. The consumer deposit betas are outperforming for you and for some others. Why is that outperforming now? And do you think that's going to last? Brian Moynihan : The consumer -- if you go to the page on deposits, there's only one -- there's a distinguishing fact that goes on a consumer at our company and generally, which really drives up the tremendous value proposition we have to be the core transaction, core relationship bank for our customers. And if you look at Page 10, you can see that the interest checking noninterest-bearing accounts, the dollar volume of deposits as a total percentage of deposits are a very high percentage, and that's where we focus on. And that allows you -- those are zero or very low rates because the amount of services that come around them. They access to 3,900 branches to the call centers to the digital platform to the ability to resolve payments, et cetera, et cetera. And that's what drives it. So it's a -- the beta is a product of a mix more than it is a product of any pricing strategy. Zero based -- zero interest -- noninterest bearing checking or zero in any rate environment. Operator : Our next question comes from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Matthew O'Connor : Capital build was obviously faster than expected or at least what most of us have expected. And it doesn't really seem like there was much revenue drag from that. Can you kind of flip the script here and lean into certain businesses? And I guess I'm thinking as we look globally, there's some peers that are needing to build capital. So maybe there\u2019s some opportunity for further share gains in areas like market and Global Banking? Brian Moynihan : Yes. Look, we're in a good position on capital even after the increased stress capital buffer results, which surprised our industry and our company, and we appealed that, as you well know, and didn't get relief, but we hope its looked at in the future. But the capital improvement really didn't take a much of revenue hit, honestly. The only place we had to hold -- just be careful almost, loan production and the high-end businesses, i.e., GCIB. Other than that, the markets business has an allocation of the size of balance sheet and capital and RWA, which basically they were able to achieve all the results were, not even use it up. And [Jamie DeMare] and team do a great job there. The rest -- everything else is there's no real change. And frankly, where we are now, those changes are that tapping is gone for this quarter already, and we're doing what we should do. Matthew O'Connor : And then separately, just a little nerdy modeling question. As we think about the timing of the tax credits being pushed out, driving the tax rate slightly higher. Is there an offset in that all other fee line that I think is viewed in tandem with the tax rate and the ESG credits? Alastair Borthwick : Yes. So I would think about it this way. The effective tax rate for Q3 and Q4, likely a little bit higher than our original guided 10% to 12%. But for the full year, it should end up right around that 12% mark. And then I'd say this year, you're right, in the fourth quarter in All Other we have to take into account the fact that the ESG deals and their timing. So I think for your model, Matt, I would use $700 million of an after-tax loss for the fourth quarter as the most likely. And I'm talking All Other now.  And if you're asking me with respect to the consolidated other income, then I'd use something very similar to the fourth quarter of 2021, where we had an $800 million pretax loss. So I just use that there, okay? Matthew O'Connor : Okay. And that's a high watermark of the year, right? Alastair Borthwick : Yes. That's just the seasonal nature of these ESG deals and their installation generally. Operator : Our next question comes from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Kenneth Usdin : Just another -- just a question or two on fees. Can you just walk us through the -- some of the deltas and the service charges line? Just talk about -- I know you had mentioned both the overdraft loan ratings, deposit changes and ECR. Just how much of that is embedded by now? And what should we look for going forward from that -- those areas? Alastair Borthwick : Yes. So Ken, I think with respect to card kind of flattish, as I would think about it right now, a little bit of fourth quarter, seasonal maybe that should benefit there. Service charges, most importantly, on the consumer side, all the [NSS FOD], we're now at the steady-state run rate. So that won't be hurting us again from this point forward. The commercial part you're right to highlight, the commercial business, the GTS business is adding clients. We're doing more with clients. So that's adding gross fees. Many of the clients prefer that earnings credit adjustment as the way that they essentially pay interest, receive interest and then pay fees. So that came down probably $150 million this quarter. I think you should expect that come down again next quarter just with the way rates are going. And then the other fees are probably pretty straightforward. Wealth will be all about market levels with a 1-month lag based on where the markets are. Investment banking kind of flattish I would think, maybe hoping for a little bit of positive at some point but not necessarily this quarter. And then sales and trading your guess is as good as ours, but we generally point to the sort of 15% seasonality in Q4 compared to Q3. And we're coming off of obviously a pretty good period. Brian Moynihan : Yes. let me -- Ken, just -- one of the things I think if it goes a little bit to Mike's point a little bit to some of their points, is that about 80-odd percent, if I got exact I think it's 84%, if I got it? Of the interchange goes back to the customer base in terms of rewards products, either directly through our own rewards programs or through some affinity group programs. So obviously, as charges go up a fair amount of that goes back. Now what does that produce in value? It produces incredible value. So a lot of that in our preferred rewards fee structure, which reward structure, which goes across all products in our company, if you even just look at the preferred segment and why deposit pricing and the stability of our accounts is different than peers in the last cycle, most of what happens at this time is that, that reward structure cements the customer relationship. And so that then has a 99% retention rate plus of those preferred customers that have about 80% of the deposits on the Consumer segment. And they are very stable and important customer base all our customer bases are. So you have to think through on those fees. We're effectively investing those fees and the duration of the customer base, the length of customer base, the profitability of the customer base, the stability of the customer base and the fact that then we can net produce a lot more customers because we're not having to replace a runoff. And so as you see so many fee lines, same with [NSS FOD] by doing what we've done the attrition rate has obviously dropped to the floor and you're seeing more production of that accounts there. And these are all related to total revenue per customer, profit per customer as opposed to any individual decision. Kenneth Usdin : I got just one separate question on -- you mentioned that this credit continues to improve, and you're seeing some underlying can just work us through just to remind us just where you are in terms of your scenarios from a CECL perspective and if the economy does, in fact, change, how weighted are you already to an already worsening scenario? Alastair Borthwick : Yes so this quarter, very similar to last quarter, we used Blue Chip consensus as our baseline. You're talking 50 different economists, some of whom are in the middle, some of whom are pessimistic themselves, some of them are more optimistic, that\u2019s 60%, that's the baseline. Other 40% is downside scenarios that we built. And there, that's the weakened that we're applying and in this particular quarter, just to give you an idea Ken, once again, we increased our forecast for inflation in that scenario. We increased unemployment in that scenario. And we decreased GDP through the course of the next couple of years. So all of that's a few quarters now in a row where that pattern is continuing and we did it again this quarter. And we'll just keep adjusting that over time. Based on the macroeconomic situation as it develops over time. Brian Moynihan : Yes. This Also, just to give a sense, though, it's a 5% unemployment like now and then continues all the way through next year. So there's an inherent in services and built into that reserving level. That our reserves can 60-40 and has those kinds of those kinds of statistics around it has inflation, but more importantly, it's based on that kind of unemployment level, which is 150 basis points over where we are. We are in October. So it will pretty quick to be this side at the end of year. Alastair Borthwick : It moves even higher than that next year, just to give you an idea, it's sort of in the mid 5s, just to give you a general sense. Operator : We'll go next to Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Vivek Juneja : Just a couple of questions, Brian and Alastair. On loan marks a quick one. How much were those in the third quarter? Alastair Borthwick : So we didn't call that out but that just for the simple reason, it was smaller this quarter. We run those through the P&L every week, as you know. So the results that you see in Global Markets and Investment Banking did include them last quarter. We called it out last quarter because it was just bigger. But this quarter, we didn't feel that we needed to. Vivek Juneja : Okay. Brian, you talked about tech spend being up if I caught it correctly, 15% in '23. Is that right? And if so, what's the dollar amount of tech spend that you're expecting in either this year or next year? Brian Moynihan : This year, we're on [3.3] next year, we move up 15%, [3.4] or something like that. Vivek Juneja : Okay. This is for the new product development type of file. Brian Moynihan : Other people talk about the overall number is like 10 billion just for the platform and all this is purely new code. Vivek Juneja : Yes. Yes. Got it. And for both of you, what are you expecting as the impact of QT on deposits? What are you modeling in? Alastair Borthwick : Well, we're obviously modeling in probably the same thing you are. We're going to have to price competitively for deposits in an environment where, obviously, market-based expectations are changing every day. So we're anticipating it's going to be a little bit tougher from this point forward, but that's already baked into our NIM. Vivek Juneja : I guess to get more precise, you have better resources and better data than we do. What betas -- where do you expect betas to get to? Alastair Borthwick : Well, that's going to differ by customer base, and I don't want to get into this on this call just because it's competitively important for us, obviously. But you can assume that at the higher end of wealth, for example, I shared that we're passing through most of that at this stage. That's going to be very different versus our noninterest-bearing accounts. It will be different for operational versus nonoperational and commercial. So beta would be in quite different places, but I'm anticipating that they'll just continue to drift up over time. Operator : We'll go next to Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Just a couple of questions. One is on how we think about comp going into next year. We've got this inflation rate that's obviously seems higher for longer and while we expect it comes down over the next 12 months? You're going into the year with it at a pretty high level and social security is even going up like 8% as we all know. So wondering how you think about that. You've done a great job at being on the front foot with regard to minimum wage increases in your shop. So should we expect more of that to come into next year's expense guide as well? Alastair Borthwick : Betsy, we -- the last several months, we've done the fifth share success program. We did our usual merit. We did a 3, 5 and 7 merit increase for everybody under $100,000 in compensation based on years of service. We went -- we accelerated $22 starting rate, which $40,000-odd a year now. And we'll continue those patterns. And the good news is we're seeing the attrition rate move. Start to move back. There was 12% drop to 6%, moved back up to 15-ish and has now dropped down the low 14s and each month starts to drop even more. So we feel that we've got the right mix, and we all look at benefits continuously. We continue to -- they didn't vary any benefits during that we would increase our childcare benefit to $275 per month per child, increased our tuition reimbursement and did it in advance. And so it's a complex package, but we should have -- we've been able to absorb all that and keep expenses down to 15.3% a quarter for the last three or four quarters, and we'll continue to do that. And that's where it comes down to also using the technology investments and operational excellence investments and continue to reduce the aggregate number of people we have working and pay those talent teammates we have even more that they work. Betsy Graseck : Okay. So expectation for that to persist, meaning flat expenses year-on-year as we go into '23. Brian Moynihan : Yes. We've said that we start growing in the 1% to 2% category, and that's part of these types of inflationary things that you're mentioning, which are higher now and then working it down over time. And so right now, we're running in the low 15 per quarter, 15.3 and we expect it to maintain and grow. But most of that growth does come, as you're saying, into the compensation and it\u2019s ebbs and flows where it goes on a given -- when the markets are driving more investment banking markets and wealth management and those come down a little bit and the other compensation comes up as we've changed the base pay and things like I talked about. But it's just -- it's a [214,000] people to a very complex discussion all over the world. So there's no one answer for the whole team. Betsy Graseck : Just one other one, Alastair. You mentioned the securities roll off that you've been able to mix shift towards the higher yields over time. Can you give us a sense as to what kind of pull the par we should be thinking about for the model on the ASCI hits that you've had to take how many quarters or years should we be thinking that gets raised over? Alastair Borthwick : So I'd say on the treasuries, generally speaking, you just think about the duration there being somewhere between four and five years. And on the mortgages, it's probably seven to eight. So it takes a while to pull the par. And then there'll be some derivatives as well. And I think the team can probably help you model that at some point. But those are broadly speaking about the numbers I would use. Obviously, it will be faster for any securities that we pay in the time. Operator : We'll take our next question from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy : You touched on there is some early-stage delinquencies in the consumer book and not so much with the hurricane. But can you give us any color -- and your numbers are obviously very strong. But can you give us some color of what you're seeing there? Is it a lower FICO score customer? Anything you can read into it? Brian Moynihan : This is one of the things you already have to be careful because obviously, when a person doesn't pay you the FICO is going down de facto. So the rate is -- the origination statistics we put back there are very strong, remains strong. And what we're seeing is, I gave you the five-year averages, which would so far exceed where we are today. We're still lower pre-pandemic. So even though we're picking back up, the word normalization, ask people to be careful because we're moving back to what was all-time lows, and we're not there. So I think if you look at the auto business, the number of repossessions and stuff was down half on a monthly basis. So we built -- under responsible growth, we built a book on the consumer side that we knew would be durable through different modeled outcomes, which is what we do in the stress testing and what we do in a reserve setting process and stuff, but also to actual outcomes and what you're seeing is it's weathering any notion of issues in the economy well. And then on commercial book, as we said, we still see upgrades exceeding downgrades. The simple way to think about it is I think we're -- the trough the P&L provision cost with flat reserve build pre-pandemic was basically $1 billion a quarter, we're running around that number now. And that's building $400 million of reserves is a little different constitution and that means unless charge-offs pick up, you're going to see the reserve build start to mitigate because sort of we're sitting here at a pretty conservative scenario now, and it will all depend on that as we go forward. But remember, the baseline is now baking in effectively a recession based on the Blue Chip. Alastair Borthwick : Gerard, I think if you went back to our supplement over the course of the past 10 years, you're going to find these numbers are so low. We're squinting to see a change here, and it's coming off of really historically extraordinary numbers. So is there a little bit of movement? Yes. But is it the second best of all time? Yes. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. Very good color. Can I follow up on the provision, Brian, you just mentioned about the $1 billion in the past. If you took that worse, you guys, I think, said 60, 40 in terms of your reserve build in terms of the base case on the economy versus a really difficult economy, if that really difficult economy went to 100%, what type of provision on a quarterly basis would that push up to? Brian Moynihan : Yes. I mean I think we have to remember that -- I'd be careful about that because basically the baseline now has built into it a fairly weak for a path in the near term. And so I wouldn't expect exactly the numbers, but if you saw we built a bunch of reserves with a 15% unemployment. My projection that, that was going to go on to [40] but I think it was in the pandemic, and you saw us move up, but we're sitting closer to what we call CECL day one and pandemic implementation. And you can see some of that in the stress test. So we don't really speculate on that. But we have on stress test to test it to make sure and you can see the Fed stress tests in the adverse case, you can see these numbers, frankly, which I don't think would ever materialize given what you do in a period of time between then and there, but that gives you some sense if you look at those\u2026 Operator : We'll take our final question today from Charles Peabody with Portales. Charles Peabody : Yes. Most of my questions were asked already. But I was just curious if you had any thoughts about how the Basel III endgame might play out and the timing of implementation of that? Or any general thoughts or color? Alastair Borthwick : No particular updates at this point. Obviously, we are waiting along with everybody else. And once we get the rules, Charles, we'll sit down and start working through our own capital base. But obviously, as Brian pointed out earlier, just the fact that we've put ourselves in a position where already we're ahead of where we need to be in January 2024. We've got a lot of flexibility at this point for whatever the endgame does come out with. Brian Moynihan : Okay. Well, thank you for all your questions and your attention. Let me just summarize for the third quarter 2022. You saw responsible growth in action once again. We had organic growth in all businesses. We had top line revenue growth driven by the NII increases. We had strong expense control, flat expenses for the third straight quarter, operating leverage for the fifth straight quarter and good work on that. We had good risk management. You can see that we're still running strong risk parameters, and we built the capital to the end-state 1/1/24 levels that we need. So that's what we call responsible growth, and now you're seeing interaction. Thank you. Operator : This does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.",

Please note, this call will be recorded, and I am standing by if you should need any assistance. It is now my pleasure to turn today\u2019s program over to Lee McEntire. Please go ahead. Lee McEntire : Thank you. Good morning. Welcome. Thank you for joining the call to review the fourth quarter results. I know it\u2019s a busy day with lots of banks reporting, and we appreciate your interest. I trust everybody has had a chance to review our earnings release documents. They\u2019re available, including the earnings presentation that we\u2019ll be referring to during the call, on the Investor Relations section of the bankofamerica.com website. I\u2019m going to first turn the call over to our CEO, Brian Moynihan, for some opening comments, and then ask Alastair Borthwick, our CFO, to cover some other elements of the quarter. Before I turn the call over to Brian, let me remind you that we may make forward-looking statements, and refer to non-GAAP financial measures during the call. Forward-looking statements are based on management\u2019s current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to materially differ from expectations are detailed in our earnings materials and SEC filings available on our website. Information about our non-GAAP financial measures, including reconciliations to U.S. GAAP can also be found in our earnings materials that are available on the website. So with that, take it away, Brian. Brian Moynihan : Thank you, Lee. And thank all of you for joining us this morning. I am starting on slide 2 of the earnings presentation. During the fourth quarter of 2022, our team once again delivered responsible growth for our shareholders. We reported $7.1 billion in net income after tax or $0.85 per diluted share. We grew revenue 11% year-over-year and delivered our sixth straight quarter of operating leverage. And again, we delivered a strong 16% return on tangible common equity. If you move to slide 3, we list the highlights of the quarter, which have been pretty consistent throughout the year. We drove good organic customer activity and saw significant increases in net interest income, which all helped drive operating leverage. Revenue increased year-over-year 11%. It was led by a 29% improvement in net interest income, coupled with a strong 27% growth in sales and trading results by Jimmy DeMare and the team. This growth will exceed the impacts of lower investment banking fees and the impact of bond and equity market valuations on asset management fees in our wealth management business. The positive contributions of NII and sales and trading were also enough to overcome a decline in service charges driven by the fully implemented changes in NSF and overdraft fees in our consumer business. Importantly, we improved our common equity Tier 1 ratio by 25 basis in quarter four to 11.2%, and we achieved that without changing our business strategies. We\u2019re well above our both -- our current 10.4% minimum CET1 requirement and above the requirement that we\u2019ll have beginning next year in January of 10.9%. We added to our buffer while both growing loans and reducing outstanding shares in the quarter. On a year-over-year comparative basis, both net income and EPS are up modestly with strong operating leverage more than offsetting higher provision expense. The higher provision expense is driven primarily by reserve builds this quarter, a result of loan growth in our portfolios and also our conservative weighting in our reserve setting methodology, which I\u2019ll touch on later. Last year, we had large reserve releases. Net charge-offs increased this quarter, but asset quality remains strong. Charge-offs are well below both the beginning of the pandemic as well as longer-term historical levels. And again, I\u2019ll touch on this in a few pages. All that being said, the simple way to think about it is pretax pre-provision income, which neutralize these reserve actions grew 23% year-over-year. Let\u2019s turn to slide 4. Slide 4 shows the year-over-year annualized results. And quarter four results were a nice finish to a successful year in which we produced $27.5 billion in net income on 7% revenue growth and a 4% operating leverage. While the year was strong, full year earnings declined as a result of loan loss reserve actions. For the full year of 2022, again, we built about $370 million reserves. And by contrast, last year, in \u201821, we released $6.8 billion of reserves. Isolating those changes, again, you\u2019ll see that PPNR grew a strong 14% over 2021. As I said earlier, the themes were characterized by good organic customer activity, strong NII and always helped by years of responsible growth. Slide 5 highlights some of the attributes of organic growth for the quarter and the year. This plus the slides that we include each earnings materials in our appendix, which show digital trends and organic growth highlights across all the businesses. Our investments over the past several years in our people, tools and resources for our customers and our teammates as well as renovating our facilities have allowed us to continue to enhance the customer experience to record high levels and fuel organic growth. In the fourth quarter of 2022, we added 195,000 net new checking accounts, bringing the total for the year to more than 1 million. This is twice the rate of addition that we had in 2019 in periods before the pandemic. This net growth has led to 10% increase in our customer checking accounts since the pandemic, while keeping that 92% of our accounts are primary checking accounts of the household and the average opening balance, not the average balance, but the average opening balance of these new accounts is over $5,000. We also produced more than 1 million new credit cards, the sixth consecutive quarter of doing that, bringing us back to levels that we generated pre-pandemic. Credit quality you can see on Appendix slides 28 for consumer remains very high in new originations. Verified digital users grew to $56 million with 73% of our consumer households fully digitally active. We have more than 1 billion logins to our digital platforms each month, and that\u2019s been going on for some time now. Digital sales are also growing, and they now represent half of our sales in the consumer business. Erica, our virtual digital assistant is now handling 145 million interactions this past quarter and has passed 1 billion interactions since its introduction just a few years ago. This saves a lot of work for our team. When you move to the GWIM business, the wealth management business, our advisers grew by 800 in the second half of the year. Our team added 28,000 net new households across Merrill and the Private Bank in 2022. We experienced solid net flows despite the turbulence of markets. By the way, during 2022, our average Merrill household opened with the balances of $1.6 million, we get very high-quality account openings. On flows, when combined across all our investment platforms in our consumer wealth management business, we saw $125 billion of net client flows this year. Additionally, we continue to see increased activity around both investments and our GWIM business and our banking products. Diversified bank element is a strong differentiator for us as a company. It also supports the healthy pretax margin. This helped the GWIM business deliver strong operating leverage for the year, and they grew revenue and net income to records. In our Global Banking business, we saw solid loan production and growing use of our digital platforms throughout the year and added new clients to our portfolio. As you well know, the overall investment banking fee pool was down. However, we continue to deepen and expand client relationships with our build-out of commercial bankers. Our global treasury services business also grew revenue 38% year-over-year as a result of both rates as well as fees for service on cash management. In global markets, we had our highest fourth quarter sales and trading performance on record, growing 27% from last year ex-DVA. This was led by a strong performance in our macro FICC businesses, where we made continuous investments over the past 18 months. Equities had a record quarter four performance as well. Let\u2019s move to slide 6 and talk about operating leverage. As I\u2019ve said to you for many years, one of the primary goals of this company which is an important part of our shareholder return model, has been to drive operating leverage. Those efforts, including investments made for the future, coupled with revenue growth produced 18 straight quarters of operating leverage, as you can see, leading up to the pandemic. Beginning last year, in the third quarter of \u201821 -- 2021, I told you that we now started achieving operating leverage and got back on streak, 6 -- and we\u2019re 6 quarters of operating leverage despite all the things that are going on out there, and the team continues to drive towards that for 2023. So, I thought I\u2019d spend a few minutes on a discussion of topics that\u2019s been important as we\u2019ve talked about investors over the last couple of months, deposits and credit. So let\u2019s go to slide 7. First, on deposits. There are several factors impacting deposits as our industry works through and the economy works through an impressive period, a surge in deposits from the pandemic-related stimulus, the impact of monetary -- unprecedented monetary easing, impact of high inflation and then the reversal of that with unprecedented pace and size of rate hikes and monetary tightening. But on a year-on-year basis, average deposits of $1.93 trillion are down 5%. This reflects the market trends and in fact, it reflects high tax payments to the governments in quarter -- 2022. In addition, as we move forward through 2022, customers with excess cash, investment-oriented cash saw yield as rates increase for money market funds, direct treasuries and other products. It\u2019s probably more relevant to discuss the more near-term trends comparing third quarter of \u201822 to fourth quarter of \u201822, average deposits were down 1.9%. Noninterest-bearing deposits are down 8%, low interest-bearing deposits are up 2%. The mix shift is especially pronounced in treasury services in the global banking business. Corporate treasurers manage $500 billion of deposits they have with us. The impact of their activities has a change in the mix. On the personal side, you can see the checking account balances floating down a little bit from core expenses and spending while more affluent customers put money into higher-yielding deposits in the market. We do manage all these products differentially. And the discussion of these deposits by business segment you can see on slide 8, and we\u2019ll talk through that. So this breaks down our deposits in a more near-term trend. In the upper left, you can see the full year across -- for the whole company going across the page and upper to the left-hand chart. We also put in the rate hikes that you can see. On the chart, you can see the heavy tax payment outflows in the second quarter. Then we saw the acceleration of rate hikes and deposits to move to products seeking yield in certain customer segments. But in large part, what you\u2019ve seen over the course of the quarter four has been stabilization and more normal client activity. Simply put, we ended quarter four of \u201822 with $1.93 trillion in deposits, roughly the overall level as we added in quarter three ending deposit balances. So, let\u2019s look at those differentiated by business. In consumer, looking at the upper right chart, we show the difference between the movement through the quarter between the balance of low to no interest checking accounts to somewhat higher yielding non-checking accounts, money market and saving accounts and a limited portion of CDs. Across the quarter, we saw a $24 billion decline in total, down 2%. We have seen small declines in customers continued higher levels of spending, pay down debt and also move money to the brokerage accounts even in this business. Higher wages have offset this. We saw a decline in quarter four deposits in consumer. Correspondingly, we also saw brokerage levels of consumer investments increased $11 billion, capturing a good portion of those deposits. In general, think of these consumer deposits are being very sticky of $1 trillion. That stickiness, along with net checking account growth reflect the recognition in the value proposition of a relationship transactional account with our company. It also has -- it reflects industry-leading digital capabilities we offer, and the convenience of a nationwide franchise. It also reflects that the customers in our mass market segments have fewer excess cash investment style cash balances. 56% of the $1 trillion in consumer deposits remain in low and no interest checking accounts. And because of all that, overall rate paid in this segment remains low at 6 basis points. In wealth management, which you can see at the bottom left of the chart, more than $300 billion of deposits became more stable across the fourth quarter. They also -- here, you also witness a shift to higher-yielding preferred deposits, as you can see on the label from lower-yielding transaction deposits as these customers have more excess cash and move them to seek higher yields. Early in the quarter, we saw modest declines in balances, but November\u2019s rate hikes began to slow and the probability of future rate hikes became less. People had moved their money, and we saw an uptick in balances as we move through the quarter. This reflects the seasonal inflows that happened in the fourth quarter for wealth management clients. At the bottom right chart, you can see the most dynamic part of this equation. Our global banking deposit movement -- moves across $500 billion in customer deposits. The shift here is what drives the mix total for the company. It\u2019s pretty typical with the exception that it happened very quickly in quarter four, driven by the pace of rate hikes. In a rising rate environment, where a company\u2019s operational funds are more expensive, we anticipate these changes, particularly in the high liquidity environments as clients use both cash inventory yield, pay down debt or manage their cash for investment yield. We have seen the mix of global banking interest-bearing deposits move from 35% last quarter to 45% in quarter four. And obviously, we\u2019re paying higher rates on those deposits to retain them. Customer pricing here is -- on a customer to customer basis based on the depth of relationship, the product usage and many other factors. So, overall deposit rates paid as a percent of Fed funds increases are still very favorable to last cycle, even as rates are rising much faster than last cycle. I would note, about to the last cycle that the Fed increases have been rapid and we\u2019d expect to pay higher rates as we continue to move through the end of the interest rate cycle. So just remember, while we\u2019re paying more for deposits, we also get that on our asset side. That is simply why the NII is -- net interest income is up 29% from quarter four 2022 versus quarter four 2021. Now let\u2019s move to the second topic I want to touch on specifically, which is credit. And this begins on slide 9. First, it is an intellectible truth that our asset quality of our customers remains very healthy. On the other hand, it\u2019s impossible to gainsay that the net charge-offs are moving to pre-pandemic levels. So, in the fourth quarter, we saw net charge-offs of $689 million, increased $169 million from quarter three. The increase was driven by both higher commercial and credit card losses. As these charts show, they\u2019re still very low in the overall context. In commercial, we had a few of older company-specific loans, but not related, not predictive of any broader trends in the portfolio. These were already reserved for in prior periods and based on our methodologies, went through charge-off in quarter four. Credit card charge-offs increased in quarter four as a result of the flow-through of modest increase in last quarter\u2019s late-stage delinquencies. This should continue as we transition off the historic lows and delinquencies to still very low pre-pandemic levels. Provision expense was $1.1 billion in quarter four. In addition to our charge-off provision included roughly $400 million reserve build. This was higher than quarter three, reflecting good credit card and other loan growth combined with the reserve setting scenario. So, let\u2019s just stop on the reserve setting scenario. Our scenario -- our baseline scenario contemplates a mild recession. That\u2019s the base case of the economic assumptions in the blue chip and other methods we use. But we also add to that a downside scenario. And what this results in is 95% of our reserve methodologies weighted towards a recessionary environment in 2023. That includes higher expectations of inflation leading to depressed GDP and higher unemployment expectations. This scenario is more conservative than last quarter scenario. Now to be clear, just to give you a sense of how that scenario plays out, it contemplates a rapid rise in unemployment to peak at 5.5% early this year in 2023 and remain at 5% or above all the way through the end of \u201824, obviously, much more conservative than the economic estimates that are out there. We included again the updated slides in the appendix, pages 36 and 37 to highlight differences in our credit portfolios between pre-financial pre-pandemic and current status. We also, again, gave you the new origination statistics for consumer credit on page 28. The work the team has done on responsible growth continues to show strong results. From an outsider\u2019s view, you don\u2019t have to look any further in the Fed stress test results. We\u2019ve had the lowest net charge-offs for peer banks in 10 of the last 11 stress tests. On slides 10 to 12, we included some longer-term perspective. We showed long-term trends for commercial net charge-offs, total consumer charge-off rates and more specifically, credit card charge-off rates. This compares those ratios to pre-financial crisis, during the recovery after the financial crisis, pre-pandemic and then through the pandemic. So that gives you a long-term perspective, which I think keeps in context the idea that we\u2019re moving off the bottom in credit cost towards a level which is normalizing to pre-pandemic, but that level was very low in the grand context of banking. So before I move it to Alastair, I want to just update a few comments on our consumer behavior. Consumer deposit balances continue to show strong liquidity with the lower cohorts of our consumers continue to hold several multiples of balance that they have as a pandemic began. These balances are drifting down, but they still have plenty of cushion left. And while their spending remains healthy, we continue to see the pace of that year-over-year growth slow. In the aggregate, in 2022, our consumer spent $4.2 trillion, which outpaced 2021 by 10%. You can see that on slide 35. Two things to note on that consumer spending pace. There continues to be a slowdown. Year-over-year growth percentage earlier this -- earlier in 2022 were 14% year-over-year. They\u2019ve now moved to 5% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. So, what does this mean, with that level of growth in year-over-year spending is consistent with the low inflation, 2% growth economy we saw pre-pandemic. They\u2019re also moving from services from goods to service and experience and spend more money on travel vacations and eating out and things like that. That is a good for unemployment, but continues to maintain service side inflation pressure. With that, let me pass the mic over to Alastair to go through the rest of the quarter. Alastair? Alastair Borthwick : Okay. Thanks, Brian. And let me start with the balance sheet, and I\u2019ll use slide 13 for this. During the quarter, our balance sheet declined $23 billion to $3.05 trillion, driven by modestly lower global markets balances. Our average liquidity portfolio declined in the quarter, reflecting the decrease in deposits and securities levels. And that $868 billion, it still remains $300 billion above our pre-pandemic levels. Shareholders\u2019 equity increased $3.7 billion from the third quarter as earnings were only partially offset by capital we distributed to shareholders and roughly $700 million in redemption of some preferred securities. We paid out $1.8 billion in common dividends. And we bought back $1 billion of shares, which was $600 million above those issued for employees in the quarter. AOCI was little changed in the quarter as a small benefit from lower mortgage rates was more than offset by a change in our annual pension revaluation. With regard to regulatory capital, our supplementary leverage ratio increased to 5.9% versus our minimum requirement of 5%. And that obviously leaves capacity for balance sheet growth and our TLAC ratio remains comfortably above our requirements. Okay. Let\u2019s turn to slide 14 and talk about CET1, where, as you can see, our capital remains strong as our CET1 level improved to $180 billion and our CET1 ratio improved 25 basis points to 11.2%. That means in the past two quarters, we\u2019ve improved our CET1 ratio by 74 basis points as we\u2019ve added to our management buffer on top of both our current and 2024 requirements. So, we can walk through the drivers of the CET1 ratio this quarter, and you can see earnings net of preferred dividends generated 43 basis points, common dividends used 11 basis points, and gross share repurchases usage 6 basis points. And while the balance sheet was down, loan growth drove a modest increase in RWA using 3 basis points of CET1. So, we were able to support our loan growth and return capital and add to our capital buffer in the same quarter. Let\u2019s spend a minute on the loan growth by focusing on average loans on slide 15. And here, you can see average loans grew 10% year-over-year, driven by credit card and commercial loan improvement. On a more near-term linked-quarter basis, loans grew at a slower 2% annualized pace just driven by credit card. The credit card growth reflects increased marketing, enhanced offers and reopening of our financial centers, delivering higher levels of account openings. Mortgage balances were up modestly year-over-year, and linked quarter were driven by slower prepayments. Commercial growth reflects a good balance of global markets lending as well as commercial real estate and to a lesser degree, custom lending in our private bank and Merrill businesses. Turning to slide 16 and net interest income. On a GAAP non-FTE basis, NII in Q4 was $14.7 billion, and the FTE NII number was $14.8 billion. Focusing on FTE, net interest income increased $3.3 billion from Q4 of \u201821 or 29%, driven by a few notable components. First, nearly $3.6 billion of the year-over-year improvement in NII was driven by interest rates. Year-over-year, the average Fed funds rates has increased 359 basis points, driving up the interest earned on our variable rate assets. Relative to that Fed funds move, the rate paid on our total deposits increased 59 basis points to 62. And focusing just on interest-bearing deposit rates paid, the increase is 91. So, even while Fed funds rates have increased 140 basis points more than the last cycle, at this point, our cumulative pass-through percentage rates still remain lower in this cycle. That includes an increase in the pass-through rates in the past 90 days due to the unprecedented period of rate hikes. Included in the rate benefit was $1 billion improvement in the quarterly securities premium amortization. Long-term interest rates on mortgages have increased 345 basis points from the fourth quarter of \u201821, which has driven down refinancing of mortgage assets and therefore, slowed the recognition of pre-amortization expense recognized in our securities portfolio. The second contributor is loan growth. Net of securities paydowns, and that\u2019s added nearly $400 million to the year-over-year improvement. And lastly, partially offsetting the banking book NII growth just described was higher funding costs for our global markets inventory. Now, that is passed on to clients through our noninterest market-making line, so it\u2019s revenue neutral to both sales and trading and to total revenue. And as you can see in our material, Global Markets NII is down $660 million year-over-year. Okay. Turning to a linked quarter discussion. NII is up $933 million from the third quarter, driven largely by interest rates. That $933 million increase included a $372 million decline in our global markets NII. The net interest yield was 2.2%, and that improved 55 basis points from the fourth quarter of \u201821. Nearly 30% of that improvement occurred in the most recent quarter with the primary driver being the benefit from higher interest rates, which includes a 13 basis-point benefit from lower premium amortization. As you will note, excluding global markets, our net interest yield was up 89 basis points to 2.81%. Looking forward, I would make a couple of comments. As I do every quarter, let me provide the important caveats regarding our NII guidance. Our caveats include assumptions that interest rates in the forward curve materialize, and we anticipate card loans will decline seasonally from holiday spend paydowns, and otherwise, we expect modest loan growth. We expect a seasonal decline in global banking deposits and that the other deposit mix shifts experienced in Q4 may continue into the first quarter in the face of more rate hikes. We also expect the funding cost for global markets to continue to increase based on higher rates. And as noted, the impact of that is recognized and offset in noninterest income, so it\u2019s revenue neutral. So, starting with the fourth quarter NII of $14.8 billion, and assuming a decline of roughly $300 million of global markets NII in Q1, which would be similar to the fourth quarter decline. That would get us to a Q1 number around $14.5 billion. In addition, we have to factor in two less days of interest, which is about $250 million. So, that would lower our starting point to $14.25 billion. We believe the core banking book will continue to show the benefit of rates and other elements and can offset most of the day count. So, we\u2019re expecting Q1 NII to be somewhere around $14.4 billion. Beyond Q1, with increases in rates slowing and if balances continue their recent stabilization trends expect less variability in NII for the balance of 2023. Okay. Let\u2019s turn to expense, and we\u2019ll use slide 17 for the discussion. Q4 expenses were $15.5 billion, and they were up $240 million from Q3, driven by an increase in our people and technology costs. In addition, we also saw higher costs from our continued return to work and travel and cost of client engagement. We\u2019ve seen pent-up demand for our teams gathering back together in person to drive collaboration and to spend more time with our clients. Inflationary pressures continued but our operational excellence improvements as well as the benefits of a more digitized customer base helped offset those pressures. Our headcount this quarter increased by 3,600 from Q3. And as we faced increased attrition in 2022, our teams were quite successful in their hiring efforts to continue to support customers. As the attrition slowed in the fall, our accelerated pace of hiring outpaced attrition, leaving us with growth in our headcount. As we look forward to next quarter, I would just remind everyone that Q1 typically includes $400 million to $500 million in seasonally elevated payroll taxes. And Q1 will also be the first quarter to include the costs of the late October announcement by regulators of higher FDIC insurance costs. And as a result of holding the leadership share in U.S. retail deposits, that will add $125 million to each of our quarterly costs or total of $500 million for the year. We expect these things will put expenses around $16 billion in the first quarter before expectations that they should trend back down again over the course of 2023. On asset quality, we highlight credit quality metrics on slide 18 for both our consumer and commercial portfolios. And since Brian already covered much of the topics on asset quality, I\u2019m going to move to a discussion of our line of business results, starting with consumer on slide 19. Brian noted the earlier organic growth across checking accounts, card accounts and investments were strong again this quarter, and that\u2019s as a result of many years of retooling and continuous investments in the business. So, let me offer some highlights. At this point, we have the leading retail deposit market share. We have leadership positions among the most important products for consumers, and we\u2019re the leading digital bank with convenient capabilities for consumer and small business clients. We also have a leading online consumer investment platform and a great small business platform offering for our clients. And importantly, when you combine all these capabilities with improved service, at this point, customer satisfaction is now at all-time highs. And we produced another strong quarter of results in consumer banking that resulted in $12.5 billion in net income in 2022. For the quarter, consumer banking earned $3.6 billion on good organic growth and delivered its seventh consecutive quarter of operating leverage, while we continue to invest for the future. Note that our top line grew 21%, while expense grew 8%. The earnings impact of 21% year-over-year revenue growth was partially offset by an increase in provision expense, and that provision increase reflects reserve builds this period compared to a reserve release in the fourth quarter of 2021. Net charge-offs increased as a result of the card charge-offs that Brian noted earlier. While this quarter\u2019s reported earnings were up 15% year-over-year, pretax pre-provision income grew an even stronger 36% year-over-year. So that highlights the earnings improvement without the impact of the reserve actions. Revenue improvement reflects the fuller value of our deposit base as well as deepening with our deposit relationships. I\u2019d note the growth also includes a decline in service charges of $335 million year-over-year as our insufficient funds and overdraft policy changes were in full effect by the end of Q2 of this year. And as a result of those policy changes, we continue to benefit from the better overall customer satisfaction and the corresponding lower attrition and the lower costs associated with fewer customer complaint calls, obviously, as a result of fewer fees. The 8% increase in expenses reflects business investments for growth, including people and technology, along with costs related to reopening the business to fuller capacity. And remember, much of the Company\u2019s minimum wage hikes and quarter two increased salary and wage moves impacts consumer banking the most of our lines of business and therefore, impacts most the year-over-year comparisons. We also continued our investment in financial centers. For the year, we opened 58 and we renovated 784 more. And against all of that, both digital banking and operational excellence helped us to pay for investments and that allowed us to improve the efficiency ratio to 47%, an impressive 600 basis-point improvement over the year-ago period. Before moving away from consumer banking, I want to note some differences to highlight just how much more effectively and efficiently this business is running since even just before the pandemic. It\u2019s easy to lose sight of how well this business is operating from an already strong position in 2019. And you can see some of the stats on slide 17 in the appendix. We can best summarize by noting we\u2019ve got $318 billion more in deposits, 10% more checking customers, 92% of whom are primary, 28% more investment accounts. And absent the card divestitures, we\u2019ve increased the amount of new card accounts by 4%, and our payment volumes are 36% higher. We\u2019re servicing those customers with 387 fewer financial centers because of our digital capabilities, and it\u2019s allowed us to need 10% fewer people to run the business. Our combined credit and debit spend was up 35%. Digital sales increased 77%, and we sent and received 3 times the number of Zelle transactions. All of this allowed us to run the business with fewer employees and lower our cost of deposits ratio below 120 basis points. Moving to slide 20. Wealth management produced strong results, earning $1.2 billion on good revenue and 29% profit margin. This led to full year records for both revenue and net income of $21.7 billion and $4.7 billion, respectively. This was an especially good result given the nearly unprecedented negative returns of both, the equity and the bond markets at the same time this year. The volatility and generally lower market levels put pressure on certain revenues in this business again in Q4, but what helps differentiate Merrill and the private bank is a strong banking business at scale with $324 billion of deposits and $224 billion of loans. So, despite a 14% decline in asset under management and brokerage fees year-over-year, we saw revenues hold flat with the fourth quarter of \u201821. Our talented group of wealth advisers, coupled with powerful digital capabilities, generated 8,500 net new households in Merrill in the fourth quarter, while the private bank gained an impressive 550 net new high net worth relationships in the quarter, both were up nicely from net household generation in 2021. We added $20 billion of loans in this business since Q4 of \u201821, growing 10% and marking the 51st consecutive quarter of average loan growth in the business despite securities-based lending reductions related to the current market environment. That\u2019s consistent and sustained performance by the teams. Our expenses declined 1%, driven by lower revenue-related incentives, partially offset by investments in our business. Moving to global banking on slide 21. And you can see the business earned $2.5 billion in the fourth quarter on record revenues of $6.4 billion, pretty remarkable given the decline in investment banking fees during this year. Lower investment banking fees, higher credit costs and a modest increase in expenses were mostly offset by stronger NII and other fees. So overall, revenue grew 9%, reflecting the value of our global transaction service business to our clients and our associated revenue growth, while investment banking fees declined a little more than 50%. The company\u2019s overall investment banking fees were $1.1 billion in Q4, declining $1.3 billion year-over-year in a continued tough market. Still, we increased our ranking in overall fees for the full year 2022 to number three as we\u2019ve continued to invest in the business. The $612 million increase in provision expense reflected a modest reserve build of $37 million in the fourth quarter compared to a $435 million release in the year ago period and pretax pre-provision income grew 13% year-over-year. Expense increased 4% year-over-year, and that was driven by strategic investments in the business, including hiring and technology. Switching to global markets on slide 22. And as we usually do, I\u2019ll talk about the segment results, excluding DVA. You can see our fourth quarter record results were a very strong finish to a good year. The continued themes of inflation, geopolitical tensions and central banks changing monetary policies around the globe continue to drive volatility in both bond and equity markets and repositioning from our clients. And as a result, it was another quarter that favored macro trading, while our credit trading businesses improved also spreads fared better than the prior year. Our fourth quarter net income of $650 million reflects a good quarter of sales and trading revenue, partially offset by lower shares of investment banking revenue. And it\u2019s worth noting that this net income excludes $193 million of DVA losses this quarter as a result of our own credit spread movements. Reported net income was $504 million. Focusing on year-over-year, sales and trading contributed $3.7 billion to revenue, and that improved 27%. That\u2019s a new fourth quarter record for this business, vesting the previous one by 21%. And at $16.5 billion in sales and trading for the year, it marked the best in more than a decade. FICC improved 49%, while equities was up 1% compared to the quarter a year ago. And the FICC improvement was primarily driven by growth in our macro products, while credit products also improved from a weaker Q4 \u201821 environment. We\u2019ve been investing continuously over the past year in our macro businesses. We\u2019ve identified those as opportunities for us. And again, we\u2019ve been rewarded for that this quarter. Year-over-year expense increased about 10%, primarily driven by investments in the business. Finally, on slide 23, we show all other, which reported a loss of $689 million, and that was consistent with the year ago period. For the quarter, the effective tax rate was approximately 10%, benefiting from ESG investment tax credits and certain discrete tax benefits. Excluding those discrete items, our tax rate would have been 12.5%. And further adjusting for the tax credits, it would have been 25%. Our full year GAAP tax rate was 11%, and we would not expect 2023 to be a lot different. So with that, we\u2019ll stop here, and we\u2019ll open it up please for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take our first question from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Glenn Schorr : Hi. Thanks very much. Need a little more help, you gave a lot, but I need a little more help on NII for 2023. You walked us to the $14.4 billion on starting point on the quarter and your words were less variability in NII for the rest of \u201823. So, I guess, my question is, you got a lot of loan growth, you have a few more rate hikes hopefully coming through, and I understand the opposite. The flip side of that is deposit migration, some outflows and betas. But could you fill in those blanks? Because I think -- I won\u2019t speak for everybody. I know I am -- we\u2019re still expecting some growth in NII for the calendar year. So, maybe you could talk through some of those pieces and maybe the outflow in global banking, noninterest-bearing is a big piece of it. So, thank you. Alastair Borthwick : Glenn, I\u2019ll start with just -- just by way of context, obviously. We\u2019re coming off a period with historic inflows for pandemic deposits. And now in Q4, we\u2019re beginning to see the impact of quantitative tightening and a number of sharp rate rises. So, that obviously creates some uncertainty. We don\u2019t necessarily have a playbook for that. We just got to see how actual balances perform, and we\u2019ve got to see how the rotation and the rate paid develop. So, it\u2019s dynamic. It\u2019s evolving, and we manage and we forecast that weekly. So, when we lay out for you the actuals on page 7 and 8 of the earnings presentation, we\u2019re trying to show you what we\u2019re seeing in real time around balances and mix. So, what we\u2019ve said with respect to this quarter coming up is we got to adjust for the day count as we would every year. That\u2019s timing, and we\u2019ll get that back, obviously, in Q2 and Q3. And then we highlighted the global markets NII impact. It\u2019s always been there. The last couple of quarters, it\u2019s been around $300 million. It is revenue neutral to shareholders as we point, because we pass that along to clients and we capture elsewhere in sales and trading, but it does obviously impact the NII. That\u2019s why we\u2019re highlighting it. But as it relates to the forecast, look, we feel like the modest balance declines are kind of in there that may continue. And this continued rotation from some of the noninterest-bearing to interest-bearing. We got some pricing and rate pressure. So, that\u2019s in the back of our mind, too. And the only final thing I\u2019ll just say is, we\u2019re reluctant to go a whole lot further out. Last year, we declined to give a full year guide. This year, we feel that way in particular because it\u2019s just a much more sensitive environment when we\u2019re modeling when interest rates are at 5% than when they were at 50 basis points. So, for all those reasons. Now, I will say this, that\u2019s the final point. We just got -- I think we got to stay patient because we got to see how rates and balances and rotation shake out. And as rates return to more normal and as customer behavior and you can sort of see it, it\u2019s behaving and maybe a little more normally than we should be able to resume our upward path over time. But we\u2019ve got to see how this shakes out, and that\u2019s why we don\u2019t want to go out beyond Q1 at this stage. Glenn Schorr : Fair enough. I feel bad for all of us. Maybe a quick one on credit. Good to see charge-offs down given everything that\u2019s going on in the world. But can you talk through the big -- the $1.6 billion sequential pickup in criticized book from last quarter? What\u2019s driving that and how you feel about reserves against that? Thanks. Brian Moynihan : Yes. So, you\u2019re aware, the main driver there is commercial real estate. And it\u2019s specifically around about $1 billion of it is office. Obviously, there\u2019s a significant amount of change going on in office. And what we\u2019ve chosen to do is as rates are rising here, we\u2019re pushing that through the models. And just with the debt service coverage it comes down, we pushed through the downgrade. So, we\u2019ve chosen to do that. The performance is still okay. So, we\u2019re not concerned with the performance, but we\u2019re just making sure we\u2019re being tight on the modeling there. It is obviously a portfolio where I think you know this, we\u2019re pretty focused on making originations into office buildings that are leased up, generally at 55% LTV at origination and 75% of that book is Class A office building. So, we\u2019re not alarmed there. We\u2019re just following our own process with respect to making sure we\u2019re current on the debt service coverage. Alastair Borthwick : Just remember that we\u2019re talking about office with very high-quality underwriting characteristics, all A Class, et cetera. And so we just have a conservative rating process, frankly. And it\u2019s well viewed out there and well looked at by many people. But remember, office is $14 billion to $15 billion of the total portfolio. So, we feel very comfortable where we are. And then, obviously, we built reserves against the portfolios across the board that are strong and reflect, as I said earlier, basically a mild recession in the base case and the worst recession in the adverse case that we wait 40%. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Alastair, on the loan loss reserving and Brian just talked about the adverse case being about 40%. Can you guys share with us how much of the reserve building is what may be referred to as management overlay relative to what the models are specifically dictating on reserve building? Brian Moynihan : Don\u2019t disclose that. You might assume that there\u2019s a fair amount. There are three components to this. One is what the model say, two is basically uncertain in precision and other things we overlay and then a judgmental, and you might think that there\u2019s a fair amount of that right now with the uncertainty. But -- so the model piece, that would be a portion of it. Gerard Cassidy : Very good, Brian. And then when you look at your deposit behavior of the consumer, the past cycles, is there any material differences in the way they\u2019re moving money around or not moving money around from their checking accounts or low-yielding savings accounts? Brian Moynihan : I think -- when you look at that higher-end consumer, not really, they move to when the rate in the market yields money market funds, we move them to it, and it\u2019s part of what we do. And that sort of investment cash, Gerard, as we call it, moves, the checking accounts don\u2019t move. The difference, frankly, is that there was a lot of stimulus that was in addition to the earnings power of consumers. So, we\u2019ve never had that in history, but -- and so that amount of stimulus. The question is, will they spend it down or will they keep storing it up? And they\u2019ve been spending it down very modestly across sort of medium income households or so and the general consumer business. Give you an example, the cohort that was $2,000 to $5,000 in average balances pre-pandemic at $3,400, they\u2019re still sitting at $12,800, but they peaked early in \u201822 at $13,400. So, they\u2019re drifting down, but it\u2019s still multiples. The big question was, will they end up spending that down? If they\u2019re employed, probably not. But if they\u2019re -- if unemployment rate changes -- and our models assume the unemployment rate changes. So I think we\u2019re at 6 basis points now in total consumer rate paid. The rate structure is very high. And we are 11 basis points, it was -- where we got to, we have very low CD volumes and things that have a fair amount of money markets, but most of it\u2019s checking. That\u2019s why we showed you the differential in checking. So, is it different? Yes, probably in the mass consumer business just because they are sitting on more cash and may use that cash, in certain scenarios, but the rest of the behavior is largely the same, including in the corporate business where people can have less balances and the effective credit rate generates a bigger number to cover their fees, so they tend to pull the balances out. Gerard Cassidy : Just quickly, Brian, just when you look at the high net worth and corporate, did that move from 0% to 3% Fed funds, for example, versus 3% to where we got today at 4.5%? Is most of that completed where the people that were going to move the money have already moved it in those two categories? Brian Moynihan : Well, I mean, I can\u2019t say definitively, but you\u2019ve seen -- that\u2019s what we showed you on those pages where we show the stable -- the account balances are relatively stable in wealth management in the fourth quarter, $300-odd billion -- $300-odd billion. Basically, they\u2019re flat, if you look across the last several weeks. So, there\u2019s always a little bit of migration to the preferred deposit, which is a market for higher-yielding sort of money market account. But, the big shift in that was, frankly, in the second quarter of \u201822 when I think we had $50 billion-odd numbers of tax payments, which was lot higher than in past years due to -- if you think about the \u201821 dynamic and capital gains and other things that went through. So, what we\u2019re seeing is the last 4 or 5 weeks, we\u2019re seeing relatively stable in deposit balances. Quarter end three, quarter and four basically flat, a little bit of movement among the categories. But in that business, frankly, a fairly sort of stable place right now. And so I think this long answer, realize a sort of answer if they move the money, they kind of already moved it. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Mike Mayo : I guess, Alastair, I guess, no good deed goes unpunished. I mean, NII did grow 21% for the year 2022. It did grow 7% linked quarter and the fourth quarter up $900 million. But six weeks after you gave guidance last quarter, you lowered that guidance by $300 million. And it just raised some questions about the quality of your modeling or if you had your arms completely around the asset liability management. So, what happened to cause you to change that guidance, albeit in the context of still some of the best NII growth you guys have seen in many years? Alastair Borthwick : Yes. So Mike, if I go back to six months ago, quarter two earnings, what we said at the time was we thought over the course of the next six months, NII might go up by $1.8 billion, $1.85 billion. In actual fact, it\u2019s gone up $2.25 billion. So, that\u2019s the actuals. Remember, we\u2019re forecasting as best we can at any given time, up $2.25 billion. Q3 was more favorable than I think we had thought and Q4 was less favorable. And the Q4 was less favorable in large part because the balances behaved just a little bit differently, and the rate paid behaved just a little bit differently. And the mix or rotation, if you like, that behaved a little differently. It kind of makes sense because Q4 is where QT kind of kicked in. So look, we don\u2019t have a great deal of precedent. It\u2019s obviously a historic period. It\u2019s difficult to forecast quarter-to-quarter, and it\u2019s -- our models are just a lot more sensitive right now. So, I think we\u2019re going to try and share with you what we know when we know it, but it\u2019s just a more difficult environment at this point to predict looking forward. Mike Mayo : It\u2019s like the first half of your round of golf, you played well, you should have just stopped after then, I guess. But, I guess, as we look -- so in other words, that $400 million extra that you got, you\u2019re kind of giving back here from the fourth to the first quarter. So, $14.4 billion NII guide, if you annualize that that would be still 9% NII growth in 2023. Is that a fair starting point? Can you give us not big confidence, but a little confidence given that deposits have stabilized, the day count, cards are seasonally lower. So again, you analyze that that\u2019s 9% NII growth. And then, Brian, still on expenses, any change there? Are you going to keep it to just like 1.5% growth? Brian Moynihan : On the first thing, Mike, you -- it was something I was going to pick up on earlier to the first question. You picked up it going to the point -- we will have growth in NII year-over-year in the range you talked about, if you take the $14.4 billion, as Alistair said, we expect it to sort of be less variability and annualize that, compare that to \u201822 of 9% as you said. So, you\u2019re exactly right. So that\u2019s good growth. And I think you\u2019ll see as you move through the year \u201823, leave aside the economic scenario playing out. But you\u2019ll see -- you\u2019ll move from where we are today, which is uncertainty about where the balances will finally settle in and the plateauing of those balances to where you get back to normalized growth and normalized loan growth, et cetera. So, you\u2019ve got it right. There\u2019ll be nice NII growth year-over-year. On expenses, if you look at your guys\u2019 estimates for us, 62.5%, which is what we sort of said earlier this -- in the fourth quarter, we\u2019re comfortable with that. That\u2019s what the average of the Street analysts are. And that takes a lot of good management to get there, and we\u2019ll continue to work on it, letting the headcount drift back down and continuing to invest in things that provide efficiencies. So, you\u2019ve got it. And key to that is the six quarters of operating leverage and the idea of continuing that going. Mike Mayo : And then, the last part of the income statement -- or the EPS is simply your excess capital, which you highlighted, it seems like you\u2019re well above your CET1 ratio. So, what does that mean for the pace of buybacks and your desire to buy back stock at this price? Brian Moynihan : We\u2019ve always said that the first desire is always to support business growth, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been doing. We then -- we\u2019re well above our minimums. We\u2019re on a path to close out the requirement for next year. And so, we bought back a chunk of shares this quarter, you expect that to start to increase neutralizing employee issuances and then going above that each quarter now because we -- 11.2% something, we were close to 11.4% targets. So, we\u2019re back in the game. Operator : Our next question comes from John McDonald with Autonomous Research. John McDonald : Alastair, I know we\u2019re asking you to predict a lot of things here. Just thinking about the credit and the pace of normalization, do you have any sense of where charge-offs kind of might start out there and what kind of pace of normalization if we look at the charge-off ratio that moved up a little bit this quarter, what might that look like for 2023? Alastair Borthwick : Yes. So, we\u2019re not going to look too far into the future, John. But if you look at our 90 days past due in the credit card data that we show you every quarter, that tends to give you a pretty good leading indicator of what\u2019s coming down next quarter. So, you can see the 90 days past due have picked up just a little bit, 30 days past due have picked up just a little bit. We\u2019re still well below where we were pre-pandemic, but that would tell you on the consumer side, it looks like it\u2019s drifting just a little higher. So, that\u2019s number one. Number two, with respect to commercial, this quarter was a little unusual. We had three deals that we ended up having to charge off. Not correlated in any way. They\u2019re in totally different businesses, and they\u2019ve been hanging around for a while. But it was -- two of them are fully reserved. So, they didn\u2019t come as a surprise. But, I think because the commercial stuff was so close to zero, it immediately looks like a pop in any given number. That\u2019s part of the reason why we showed those graphs of what charge-offs have looked like over time in the earnings materials. But, the commercial portfolio continues to look very strong. John McDonald : Okay. And you touched on this a little bit on Brian\u2019s comments, but just on loan growth, what are you guys thinking about for this year? And what\u2019s the perspective of where you closed the spigots a little bit in the third quarter as you managed RWA. You kind of said those were opening up in the fourth, but we didn\u2019t really see it translate to robust loan growth. Just kind of that dynamic between what you\u2019re looking to do and what you\u2019re seeing on demand for loan growth outlook. Thank you. Alastair Borthwick : Yes. So, we said we\u2019re quite open for business in the fourth quarter, and that remains the case. Brian covered the capital point. We had to do what we had to do in the third quarter. We did it. We\u2019ve added 75 basis points of capital in the last two quarters, puts us in a great place. So mainly what you\u2019re seeing in Q4 is just it was a slower environment for loan growth. A year ago, we were talking about the fact we anticipated that loan growth might be high single digits, and we grew 10. This year, we feel like it\u2019s going to be mid-single digits, it\u2019s going to be slower. And it\u2019s going to be led by commercial, it will be led by card, but things like securities-based lending, that\u2019s just quieter. We\u2019ve got balances being paid down there. Mortgage is quiet through this year. And then, in our base case, you look at the economic blue-chip consensus, you can see forecast is for recession. So, it will be a quieter our loan growth year this year, I suspect, but we\u2019re open for business to support our clients. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Erika Najarian with UBS. Please go ahead. Erika Najarian : I just had one compound clarifying question. The first is, Brian, did you, in response to Mike\u2019s question on NII, bless $57.6 billion in NII for \u201823, right? He was saying $14.4 billion times 4 or 9% NII growth. You seem to be going with it. I just wanted to confirm that. I think there\u2019s a bit of confusion given that you guys were saying you don\u2019t want to go beyond the first quarter? And the second question is also for you, Brian. I think that you\u2019ve done an unbelievable job at transforming the company. And I think the one thing that remains is that the investor base still thinks you as mostly a bank to invest in when rates are going up, right? And clearly, there\u2019s a lot of uncertainty over the NII outlook. But, could you sort of give us what we should be potentially excited about that you can control with regards to the revenue trajectory from here? And also you spent so much time on deposits. I\u2019m just kind of confused on the message in terms of deposit declines from here because you laid out this case that you have this very resilient deposit base, and it seems like a lot of attrition has already happened. So, that -- sorry, that was actually three questions in one. I apologize, but that\u2019s it. Brian Moynihan : I think, I\u2019ll put all those questions together in one answer. If you go the page that\u2019s in the report where we sort of say, look at the difference between the consumer business in \u201819 and now. And it\u2019s something to be excited about because we have -- during a period of time where we were completely shut down in branches like 2,000, open back up. We actually went down from 4,300 branches to 3,900 branches. We built out in a lot of new cities. We still have work. We have 10% more checking accounts. The customer favorability is an all-time high. Our small business part of that business is the biggest in the country and growing. And you look at that, and that provides a great anchor, which provides that great stable deposit base, we show you on the slide where we show that base. It also provides a lot of very low-cost deposits. And as rates rise and materialize that. And then if you think what happened last cycle, for a year when rates did not move up, we continue to grow deposits in the consumer business in the mid-single-digits, which just is infinite leverage. And so, that\u2019s something to be excited about from not only a customer side, where we\u2019re digitized and Zelle usage is going up. Erica usage is going up -- Erica, meaning our Erica, not you, Erika. But the -- and the balance of the consumer investments open up 7% more accounts in a year where investment world was choppy. And then you pair that into the wealth management business, same thing, one of the biggest deposit franchise in the country, biggest -- 3-point-something trillion high, $3 trillion of assets, growing net households at the fastest rate it\u2019s grown in a long, long time, maybe history, growing advisers. Those are things to get excited. That\u2019s the organic growth engine in the company. You got to put that against the backdrop of a plateauing of NII, which is basically what Alastair said sort of think about less variability around the $14.4 billion starting number, which might be annualized and did math. And so, did the math and made it out, but that provides us a good base of which to drive forward. And so, you really got to get through the economic uncertainty and then all those things will start to bear. Meanwhile, the trading business, which we invested in a couple of years ago now at its best fourth quarter ever and Jimmy and the team are doing a good shape. And so, I -- we just feel good about the overall franchise, more customers, more of each customer, and then that provides a big stable base, which is rate increases slow down, the marginal impact of it will slow down until we see the good core loan and deposit growth, which you saw after rate -- the last rate rising increase stopped and produced the 20 quarters of operating leverage or -- and things like that. So, that\u2019s pretty good to be excited about. Because bank growing its franchise and they are -- growing solid economy in the world at a faster rate than anybody else is pretty interesting. Erika Najarian : Just to clarify, Brian, you mentioned the plateauing of NII and then, hopefully, all the investments in the business will drive growth from there. Is that still possible if we have a continued rate cuts through 2024? Brian Moynihan : The scenario of rate cuts and rate rises, we basically use blue chips. So, I\u2019m not sure. It depends on what\u2019s causing that. So if it\u2019s a normalization of the rate curve back to say, 3% at front end, 4.5% at the back end or something like that. That\u2019s different than what you saw when they had to cut rates for the pandemic or after the financial crisis and left in there for years to get the engine of the United States economy restarted. What\u2019s different this time, frankly, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re talking about the consumer data is even with a strong rise in interest rates, a less tight labor market, and inflation and what people are being told to worry about, you\u2019re actually seeing consumer spending consistent with a good 2% growth environment, a low inflation environment, which is good because the consumer is being appropriately conservative right now. Alastair Borthwick : Erika, the other thing I\u2019d just say is you think about why we\u2019ve got a slowdown in some of our fee-based businesses right now, it\u2019s because rates have risen so quickly and that\u2019s created a lot of volatility and it\u2019s created -- the asset management business that\u2019s had a big sell off in bonds and stocks. So, we\u2019re poised now in a lower base where we can grow from here. Same thing, if you look at our net income, we\u2019ve really outrun pretty historic decline in investment banking fees. So, we got a diversified set of businesses where as some normalcy returns, we can see some pickup in those fee lines as well. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Ken Usdin : I wanted to follow up, Alastair. You had about $800 million of incremental interest income from the securities book. And I\u2019m just wondering if you can help us understand how much of that was attributed to the continued benefit from the swap portfolio? And also then how would you expect that to impact your outlook for the 14.4% in the first quarter guide? Thank you. Alastair Borthwick : Yes. So most of the increase in securities portfolio, we\u2019re not really reinvesting in there at this point as the securities portfolio started declining. We\u2019re using the money that\u2019s throwing off to put it into loans. That\u2019s always our first preferred place. So, you\u2019re picking up on the right thing. It\u2019s mainly the treasuries that are in there, they\u2019re swapped to floating. That way, we don\u2019t have any capital impact from rising rates. And so, you\u2019re going to see the securities yield just continue to pick up. Number one, based off of the treasuries swap to floating as floating rates go higher. And number two, as the securities come due, there\u2019ll be fewer and fewer of them at lower rates. And so, you\u2019re going to see the pickup over time. Ken Usdin : And just as a follow-up, what\u2019s our best benchmark rate to kind of watch that trajectory for how we can understand that helper from that swap portfolio? Alastair Borthwick : Normally, it\u2019s SOFR, secured overnight financing rate. Ken Usdin : Okay, great. Second quick one just on capital. You had 20 basis points increase in your CET1. You did $1 billion or so of the buyback. Just wondering how you\u2019re thinking about capital return with the bar package of rules still ahead of us going forward. Thanks. Alastair Borthwick : Well, I think Brian said the right things. The strategy hasn\u2019t changed. We\u2019ve got to, number one, support our clients. We\u2019re going to number two, invest in our growth. Then we plan to just sustain and grow our dividend and over time, we\u2019ll balance building capital and buying back shares. I think, the difficult part with Basel III endgame right now is we don\u2019t have the rules. So, we got to wait, I think, until we see those. They\u2019ll go through a comment period. At that point, we\u2019ll offer much more perspective. But I\u2019ll say the obvious, banks have got plenty of capital. We were asked to take 90 basis points more in June. There\u2019s a lot of procyclicality already in things like the stress test and stress capital buffer and in CECL. And I think, look, we\u2019ve shown our ability to perform and build capital, in this case, 75 basis points in two quarters. So, we\u2019ll deal with whatever the ultimate rules come out with. Operator : Our next question comes from Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Matt O\u2019Connor: Good morning. Have you kind of thought about how to better insulate yourself against potentially lower rates and not just kind of a little bit of a decline, but if we get something unusual and rates drop a lot. I know it\u2019s easier for some of the smaller banks to do it, but we have seen some regional banks essentially trying to lock in a corridor of the NIM, so that kind of medium term it\u2019s more about growing the balance sheet versus the rate moves up and down. And clearly, with your deposit rates low, if we do get Fed cuts, there\u2019s just not as much leverage to bring down those rates. Alastair Borthwick : Yes. So, I don\u2019t know that we\u2019ve thought about it in terms of like a corridor of NIM, but we definitely think about balancing earnings and capital and liquidity through the cycle. So, I don\u2019t see us making significant changes to our core. We\u2019re trying to make sure that we operate and deliver in all rate environments that can be high or two years ago can be zero rate environment. So the changes -- you can start to see our changes at the margin. You can see we\u2019re taking securities out and replacing them with loans, and you can see everything restriking higher. So, we\u2019ve got a smaller, more efficient balance sheet. We, at the margin may consider fixing some rates here depending on how things develop over the quarter. But it\u2019s -- we\u2019ve had a pretty, I\u2019d say, good strategy that\u2019s allowed us to drive net interest yields. You can see those on page 16. They\u2019re up 46% over the course of the past year and drive the NII. That\u2019s up $3.3 billion year-over-year. So, we feel like we struck that balance. That\u2019s what responsible growth means to us. And at the margin, we\u2019ll probably still maintain a little bit of asset sensitivity. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Two questions. One, just a little more color on the loan growth outlook. I heard you on expecting that loan growth will be slowing as you go through the year. And I just wanted to get an understanding of -- is that more just demand slowing base effects or is there also anything in there from you on proactive credit decisioning as normalization comes through the rest of the year? Brian Moynihan : That\u2019s a couple of things. If you look in the fourth quarter, you can see the cards come up, which is seasonal, and that\u2019s going to come down, and that\u2019s one of the things that people tend to pay those down. The usage of those cards frankly, are still at low levels, the pay rate, the way to think about that still in the 30s. So, that\u2019s sort of one thing that\u2019s been kind of consistent through the pandemic. The customers are paying down the card balances. And you expect at some point, those will get back to more normalized paydown rate in the mid-20s. The second is line usage, frankly, has also come back down. It\u2019s not gotten ever back to where it was pre-pandemic, and it moved up and it dropped by 100 or so basis points, which across a lot of lines is a fair amount of loan. So, that you saw. And so, how corporates manage their borrowing and cash and demand cycle seems to be flattening out a little bit. Then obviously, acquisitions and things are way slowed down, so there wasn\u2019t much activity there. So, I think you put it together, then you have in the securities-based business, customers took down leverage, paid off a fair amount of loans in the wealth management business, even though they\u2019ve grown, I think, for 50 some quarters in a row now or something like that in loan balances, it happens, mortgages, obviously, are low. So -- but what we think is as the rate environment settles in, you\u2019ll see that normalize and that we\u2019ll get -- we\u2019ll be back on the mid-single digits. We just won\u2019t have the 10% loan growth year-over-year because that is faster in economy and faster we do. We have not changed credit underwriting standards. And you can see that in the consistency of the origination standards back in pages of the appendix where we show sort of our cars and home equity and things like that. It\u2019s just the demand side is a little soft because people are reading the same headlines we\u2019re all reading about recessions coming and what should -- they should be careful. Betsy Graseck : Okay. Got it. And then, on the expense side, I know we talked a lot about the NII and the puts and takes as you go through the year that you\u2019re looking for. What about stability on the expense line to manage through any worse than expected outcomes on the NII? What kind of levers do you think you have to pull there, Brian? Brian Moynihan : Well, we always have the variable compensation stuff will drop because assuming that the reason why rates are going -- being cut is because economic activities were some people thought. And then you have the general just efficiency movements in the house that we\u2019ve been pretty good at. And then, you have to remember, we try to get people to go off of nominal expense to operating leverage. And so, we have six quarters of operating leverage. As the NII growth slows down, we have to manage a company to produce operating leverage. And so, we\u2019d expect that fees might stabilize and absorb the $1 billion downdraft in quarterly investment banking fees and start to work up from there and other types of things. So, I think we feel very good about the ability to find ways to manage expenses, always have. We slowed down hiring as we came into the fourth quarter, not because, frankly, we were hired -- we\u2019ve gotten our hiring to match the great resignation earlier in the year, and it was sort of overachieving. So, we slowed that down, and that will allow us to get back in the line and start to bring the headcount back down to where we want it to be. But those are, frankly, positions that are relatively -- have a relatively high movement rate and only because of the nature of the job. So we feel good about between very rate compensation, between continue to reduce headcount for efficiency and frankly, just activity levels, in a down scenario we\u2019ll be able to pull the expenses down. But yes, meanwhile, we we\u2019re going to invest $3.7 billion in technology development in \u201823 versus $3.4 billion in \u201822. We continue to add bankers. We had 800 wealth management advisers in the second half of last year, where our training program for those across wealth manage -- all of our wealth management businesses and other trading programs. We continue to hire young talented people. So we\u2019re trying to maintain that balance of continuing to invest in the growth opening in new cities. We\u2019re averaging -- these branches we\u2019re opening are extremely successful when you look at the size of them relative to anybody else\u2019s opening practice. And so, why would you stop that. And yet the total number of branches comes down because we\u2019re managing the expense side. So, we\u2019re paying for this stuff as we go. But -- and so you could slow some of that down and get leverage out of it. But the question would be, as we\u2019re in that scenario, is that the right decision for long-term value creation. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Vivek Juneja with JP Morgan. Vivek Juneja : Thank you. A couple of clarifications on the same NII question. I just want to understand, in your assumption about staying at $14.4 billion through the year on a quarterly basis, are you assuming deposits to continue growing or shrinking? Number one, are you expecting further rotation out of noninterest-bearing to interest-bearing? And do you expect the $14.4 billion number even if there are rate cuts towards the end of the year? Is that number doable even with -- what is it that you\u2019re assuming? Is it even with rate cuts? Brian Moynihan : So, Vivek, we just said less -- there\u2019d be less variability around that number due to the fact the market stuff has gone to zero. That has no impact on it that you saw over the last few quarters have impact. So, less variability. All the things you cited are the reasons why we tend to say you have to be careful about saying what\u2019s going to happen in the fourth quarter \u201823 with great clarity. What we did say is if at this level with less variability, you\u2019ll have nice growth over this year to next year. But I think everything you point out, whether it\u2019s whether it\u2019s rates going up faster than people think because inflation doesn\u2019t going to roll or come down because people think that they\u2019ve done a good job and they want to get behind the economy. We base our modeling on the blue chip economic assumptions out there and then looking at our balances and stuff. And so, I think that\u2019s a reluctance. So all your points are great points, and they\u2019re all why we are reluctant to say. I can tell you to the 3 decimal places where it\u2019s going to be three quarters out because it can move around on you. And to Mike\u2019s earlier point, we grew $1.2 billion and $900 million in linked quarter and somehow people thought that wasn\u2019t good enough because there\u2019s math that could have would have gotten you difference. So, stay tuned and we\u2019ll tell you what we know when we know it. And -- but it\u2019s good again at customer growth. 1 million net new checking accounts, starting at $5,000 balances, growth in wealth management and loans and deposits. These are things that stick with you and be good no matter what the scenario. Vivek Juneja : Another -- a different question slightly. You gave the $2,000 to $5,000 deposit cohort, Brian, in terms of where they are in the deposit balances. In the past, you\u2019ve also given a cohort below that, like $1,000 type cohort. Where does -- how is that doing? Can you give any numbers on that? Brian Moynihan : It\u2019s similar. It\u2019s -- they\u2019re all moving down very slightly, that average balance for that same group of customers taken out. I\u2019d say -- so it\u2019s in the same sort of -- different sizing, but it\u2019s the same thing. I don\u2019t have it right in front of me, but -- I\u2019ll have Lee get it to you. But I don\u2019t -- but it\u2019s moving down slightly. The interesting part of that, Vivek, obviously, is in the highest average balances. You actually have seen them down from pre-pandemic, which means you saw them reposition that in the market. So going to the early question, we may have seen a lot of that already take place. But I think of it as being down slightly quarter-over-quarter in that cohort. Operator : We have no further questions in queue at this time. I\u2019d like to turn the program back over to Brian Moynihan for any additional or closing remarks. Brian Moynihan : Thank all of you. Good quarter to finish 2022, and thank you to our teammates for producing it. We continue to grow earnings year-over-year. We have good organic growth and operating leverage for the sixth straight quarter. Those will continue in 2023. The asset quality in the company continues to remain at historic lows relative to any normalized time period in the company\u2019s history, including the strong credit performance we had just leading into the pandemic. So, our job is now to drive what we can control, which is the organic growth of the franchise, the investments that we make are bearing fruit and also to keep the expenses in good control, and we plan to do that in 2023. Thank you. And we look forward to talking to you next quarter. Operator : This does conclude today\u2019s program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Bank of America Earnings Announcement. At this time, I'd like to turn the program over to Lee McEntire. Please go ahead, sir. Lee McEntire : Thank you, Catherine. Good morning. Welcome. Thank you for joining the call to review our first quarter results. I trust everybody has had a chance to review our earnings release documents. They are available, including the earnings presentation that we'll be referring to during this call, on the Investor Relations section of the bankofamerica.com website. I'm going to turn the call over to CEO, Brian Moynihan; and Alastair Borthwick, our CFO, to discuss the quarter. But before I do, let me just remind you that we may make forward-looking statements and refer to non-GAAP financial measures during this call. Our forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and assumptions, and subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that might cause those actual results to materially differ from those expectations are detailed in our earnings materials and the SEC filings that are available on our website. Information about the non-GAAP financial measures, including reconciliations to U.S. GAAP, can also be found in our earnings materials, and those are available on our website. So, with that, I will turn it over to Brian. Thank you. Brian Moynihan : Good morning, and thank you all of you for joining us. I'm starting on Slide 2 of the materials. Your company produced one of its highest core EPS, earnings numbers in a challenged operating environment in the first quarter. Simply put, we navigated that environment well. The preparedness and strength of Bank of America and the trust of our clients reflects a decade-long responsible growth model and relationship nature of our franchise. During quarter one, importantly, organic growth engine continued to perform. Let me first summarize some points, and I'll turn it over to Alastair to take you through the details of the quarter. If you go to Slide 2 of the materials, Bank of America delivered strong earnings, growing EPS 18% over first quarter '22. Every business segment performed well. We grew clients and accounts organically and at a strong pace. We delivered our seventh straight quarter of operating leverage, led by a 13% year-over-year revenue growth. We further strengthened our balance sheet, with our CET1 ratio increasing to 11.4%. Regulatory capital ended at the highest nominal level in our history at $184 billion. We maintained strong liquidity. We ended the quarter with more than $900 billion in Global Liquidity Sources. We are in good returns for you as our shareholders, with a return on tangible common equity of 17%, a 107 basis points return on average assets. Tangible book value per share grew 9% year-over-year. We did this as the economy slowed. And, remember, our research team continues to predict a shallow recession that will occur beginning in the quarter three of 2023. It's interesting, when we look at our consumer behavior, payments by consumer continued to drive the U.S. economy. We've seen debit and credit card spending at about 6% year-over-year growth pace, a little slower but still healthy. But, remember, card spending represents less than a quarter of how consumers pay for things out of their accounts at Bank of America. Overall payments from our customers' accounts across all sources were up 9% year-over-year for March as a month. Year-to-date, they were up about 8% for the quarter. After slowing in the back half of 2022 a bit, we saw the payments -- pace of payments picked back up in quarter one, especially in the latter parts of the quarter. Consumers' financial positions remains generally healthy. They're employed with generally higher wages, continue to have strong account balances, and have good access to credit. As you think through all the tightening actions of the Fed, the flows to alternative yielding assets, investments and the disruption the past quarter, our deposits continued to perform well, ending the quarter at $1.91 trillion. If you think about it, that's about the same balance that we had in mid-October of 2022. So, we've seen these balances stabilize and remain 34% above they were in prior to the pandemic. The team has managed well during these periods by remaining focused on the things we can control to drive value through our franchise. I thank them for a very strong quarter, near-record earnings with strong returns. Let me turn the call over to Alastair to walk through the details of the quarter. Alastair Borthwick : Thank you, Brian. And I'll pick up on Slide 3, where we list some of the more detailed highlights of the quarter. And then, on Slide 4, we present the summary income statement. So, I'm going to refer to both of these together. As Brian mentioned, for the quarter, we generated $8.2 billion of net income, and that resulted in $0.94 per diluted share. Our revenue grew 13%, and that was led by a 25% improvement in net interest income, coupled with strong 9% growth in sales and trading results, excluding DVA. Our non-interest revenue was strong, despite three headwinds : First, we had lower service charges as commercial clients paid lower fees for treasury services, since they now receive higher earned rates on balances. And, obviously, that allows us to invest those funds to earn NII. On consumer, we had lower NSF insufficient funds and overdraft fees as a result of our policy changes announced in late 2021. Second, with lower asset management fees and that just reflects the lower equity market levels and fixed-income market levels. And, third, investment banking fees were lower, just reflecting the continuation of sluggish industry activity and reduced fee pools. Now, all that said, despite these headwinds, each of the three categories saw modest improvement from the fourth quarter levels. Asset quality remained strong, and provision expense for the quarter was $931 million. That consisted of $807 million of net charge-offs and $124 million of reserve build. And that reserve build compares to a reserve release in the first quarter 2022 of $362 million. Our charge-off rate was 32 basis points and still well below the fourth quarter of '19 when our pre-pandemic rate was 39 basis points. And, remember, 2019 was a multi-decade low. So, credit, obviously, remains quite strong. I want to make one other point on Slide 4 and that is simply to note that pre-tax pre-provision income grew 27% year-over-year compared to reported net income growth of 15%. So, let's turn to the balance sheet that starts on Slide 5. And you can see, during the quarter, our balance sheet increased $144 billion to $3.195 trillion. Brian noted our liquidity levels at the end of the period, those rose to more than $900 billion from December 31. That's $23 billion higher and it remains $324 billion above our pre-pandemic level in the fourth quarter of '19. Shareholders' equity increased $7 billion from the fourth quarter as earnings were only partially offset by capital distributed to shareholders, and we saw an improvement in AOCI of $3 billion due to lower long-term interest rates. The AOCI included more than $0.5 billion increase from improved valuations of AFS debt securities and that flows through CET1. And the remaining $2.5 billion due to changes in cash flow hedges doesn't impact regulatory capital. During the quarter, we paid $1.8 billion in common dividends and we bought back $2.2 billion in shares. Turning to regulatory capital, our CET1 level improved to $184 billion since December 31 and our CET1 ratio improved 14 basis points to 11.4%, once again, adding to our buffer over our 10.4% current minimum requirement as well as the 10.9% minimum requirement that we'll see on January 1st of 2024. That means, in the past 12 months, we've improved our CET1 ratio by 100 basis points, and we've supported our clients and we've returned $12 billion in capital to shareholders. CET1 capital improved $4 billion, and that reflects the benefit of earnings and the AOCI improvement, partially offset by the capital we've returned to shareholders. Our risk-weighted assets increased modestly and that partially offset the benefit to the CET1 ratio of the higher capital we generated. And then, our supplemental leverage ratio increased to 6%. That compares to a minimum requirement of 5% and leaves plenty of capacity for balance sheet growth, and our TLAC ratio remains comfortably above our requirements. So, let's spend a minute on loan growth, and we'll do that by turning to Slide 6, where you can see the average loans grew 7% year-over-year, driven by commercial loans and credit card growth. The credit card growth reflects increased marketing, it reflects enhanced offers and higher levels of card account openings. The commercial growth across the past year reflects the diversity of commercial activity across global banking and global markets and, to some degree, global wealth. And on a more near-term linked-quarter basis, loans grew at a much slower pace, partly driven by seasonal credit card paydowns after the fourth quarter holiday spending, and then commercial demand slowed in Q1 and we saw some paydowns by our wealth management clients as they lowered leverage as rates rose. So, let's turn to deposits and there's obviously been a lot of additional focus this quarter, so I want to spend extra time here and I'm going to start with Slide 7 and talk about average deposits. Just a few points we need to make before focusing on a more detailed discussion of the recent trends. Average total deposits for the first quarter were $1.89 trillion, that is down 2% linked-quarter and down 7% year-over-year. Our deposits peaked in the fourth quarter of 2021. And even as the Fed has continued to withdraw money supply, our deposits have held around $1.9 trillion, because there's a lot more industry deposits today in a much bigger economy today compared to pre-pandemic. Our average deposits were up 34% compared to our pre-pandemic Q4 '19 balance and the industry's deposits were up 31% to $17.4 trillion. So, we've obviously fared a little bit better than the industry. We put our pre-pandemic deposits for each line of business on the slide, so you can compare our balances then and now. I want to highlight consumer checking balances, which remained 53% higher than pre-pandemic. And as I think all of us would expect, GWIM combined client deposits are up a lesser 23%, as those are the clients that generally move their excess cash into other off-balance sheet products. And in global banking, you can see the rotation to interest-bearing across time as rates rose. So, let's get a little more granular and a little more near-term and we'll use Slide 8 for that, where you can see the breakout of deposit trends on a weekly ending basis across the last two quarters. You can also see that we plotted the timeline of Fed target and rate hikes on the top-left chart, just for comparison through time. In the upper left, you can see the trend of our total deposits. We ended Q1 '23 at $1.91 trillion, that's down 1%. And, as Brian mentioned, over the course of the past six months, those balances have been relatively stable. In consumer, looking at the top-right chart, we show the difference here in the movement through the quarter between the balances of low to no interest checking accounts, and the higher-yielding non-checking accounts and, across the entire quarter, we saw a modest $4 billion decline in total. Checking balances, obviously, have some variability around pay days in particular, but note the relative stability of checking deposits, because these are the operational accounts with money and motion to pay the bills and everyday living costs for families. I'd also point out that our checking balances were modestly growing even ahead of March 9th upheaval and continue to move higher through the quarter on the back of disruption. Lower non-checking balances mostly reflect money moved out of deposits and into brokerage accounts where we earn a small fee. Rate paid increased 6 basis points from the fourth quarter to 12 basis points on this [trillion dollars] (ph) of total consumer deposits and remains low, because of the 52% mix that is checking. Lastly, I just note that the rate movements in this business are concentrated in the small CDs and consumer investment deposits, which together represent about 5% of the deposits. In wealth management, as you would expect, it shows the most relative decline, and you can see the continued trend of clients moving money from lower-yielding sweep accounts into higher-yielding preferred deposits and off-balance sheet to other investment alternatives. Now, if we went back further, you'd see that roughly $90 billion has moved out of sweeps in the past year, which leaves $80 billion in these accounts. So, you can see how with the pace and size of rate hikes slowing, we expect the declines in balances to lessen from here. At the bottom-right, note the global banking deposit movement, where we hold about $500 billion in customer deposits. These are generally operational deposits of our commercial customers and they use that to manage their cash flows through the course of the year. Those were down $3 billion from the fourth quarter. And what's interesting to note is that, our total deposits in this segment have been stable at around $500 billion for the past six months and this business just continues to see rotation into interest-bearing. The mix of interest-bearing deposits on an ending basis moved from 49% last quarter to 55% in Q1. And, obviously, we pay increased rates on those interest-bearing deposits. And it's this rotation in global banking that's driving the rotational shift of the total company, and it's pretty typical and to be expected in this environment. So, in summary, our deposits continued to behave as we would expect. The cash transactional balances have shown some recent stabilization. And for investment cash, we've seen deposits moved to brokerage and other platforms for direct holdings of money market, mutual funds, treasuries, and we are capturing many of those flows as you see in our numbers, it's just we expect that to slow going forward. So, now that we've examined trends for the different lines of business, I want to make some important points about the characteristics of our deposit franchise using Slide 9, and this will just help reinforce for shareholders who own Bank of America that they're investing in one of the world's great deposit franchises, all of it based off of relationships we have with our customers and the value they place on the award-winning capabilities and convenience they have access to. So, starting from the top, focus first on consumer. You can see that more than 80% of deposits have been with us for more than five years, and more than two-thirds of our consumer deposits are balances with customers who have had relationships with the bank for more than 10 years. Also, more than three-quarters of these customers are very highly engaged in their activities with us. They are also, geographically, dispersed across the United States given our presence in 83 of the top 100 markets. Lastly, whether you look at consumers or small business, the value proposition is what's driving the same result. We've got long-tenured customers with deep relationships that are highly engaged. Turning to wealth management, you can see a similar story around long tenure and quite active relationships. The average relationship of our GWIM clients is around 14 years. And, again, these clients are very geographically diverse, they're also very digitally engaged, and we continue to see deepening around banking solutions and products of all types. There's lots of options for these clients that extend from their operational checking accounts all the way up through preferred deposit options, and then we also benefit from having great alternatives for them within our investment platform. On global banking, note that 80% of our U.S. deposit balances are held by clients who have had an account with us for at least 10 years. Furthermore, as we measure the number of solutions that clients have with us, we know that 73% of balances are held by clients that have at least five products on us and, just like the other businesses, they are highly diversified by industry and geography. So, those are some of the things that make our quality deposit base stable. So, now that we've walked through both loans and deposits, I want to transition a bit to make some points on balance sheet management and to focus on the liquidity we enjoy by having a surplus of customer deposits that far exceeds the loan demand of our clients today and far exceeded the loan demand of our clients pre-pandemic. Having the deposits alone doesn't pay the expenses to support these great customer bases and it doesn't mean much to our shareholders, unless we put them to work to extract the value of those deposits. So, that's what we're trying to illustrate and we want to show you how we do them. You can see that on Slide 10, where you note we had significant excess deposits over loans pre-pandemic. And during the pandemic, that increased -- that amount increased significantly. Before the pandemic, we had $0.5 trillion more in deposits than loans and that peaked in late 2021 at more than $1.1 trillion and it remains high at roughly $900 billion still today. That's the context as we talk about how we manage excess cash. So, let's turn to Slide 11. And here we're going to focus on the banking book, because our global markets' balance sheet has remained largely market funded. And just follow the graph from left to right. At the top of the slide, you note trend of cash and cash equivalents and the two components of the debt securities balances : available-for-sale and held-to-maturity. And you can see the trend of the overall combined cash and securities balance movement and it closely mirrors the previous slide's excess deposit trends, as you would expect. In 2020, deposits grew, while loans declined and that was pandemic borrowing from our commercial clients stopping and then quickly paying it off. Throughout 2020, as we put deposits to work, we took a number of actions to protect our capital and that included a buildup in hold-to-maturity, better aligning our capital treatment with our intent to hold those securities to maturity. We also hedged rate risk in the available-for-sale book using pay-fixed, receive-variable swaps. So, these securities acted like cash and they earned higher yields and guarded against capital volatility. As we entered the middle of 2021, it became more clearer that the stimulus payment would likely be the last one and, therefore, we believed deposits would be peaking. As a result, we stopped adding to our hold-to-maturity securities book. That book peaked in the third quarter of 2021 at $683 billion, $562 billion were mortgage backs, and the rest were treasuries. And all that's happened is that notional balances have declined in each of the past six quarters, ending the quarter at $625 billion. And within that, the mortgage-backed portfolio was down $67 billion to $495 billion. As rates began to rise quickly throughout 2022, the value of our deposits rose. And, at the same time, the disclosed market value of the hold-to-maturity securities has declined, resulting in a negative market valuation on those bonds. That negative market valuation peaked in the third quarter, came down in the fourth quarter, and it's come down another $10 billion in the first quarter. In our 10-K disclosure, we included a chart which shows the maturity distribution of our securities portfolio. And, I'd remind you, this is based on the maturity dates of those originations, i.e., the date of the last contractual payment. When we look at the actual cash flows of those bonds over time, it results in an average weighted life of the hold-to-maturity securities book of a little more than eight years. And as you can see, since the third quarter of 2021, we've continued to see increases in the overall yield on the balances due to both the maturity and reinvestment of lower-yielding securities as well as remix into higher-yielding cash. And, as you can see, with deposits paying 92 basis points, that compares to our blend of cash and government-guaranteed securities, which pays 290 basis points. So, we continue to benefit NII and yield. And, finally, one very important last point I want to make, which is on the improved NII of our banking book. Because, remember, we manage the entirety of our balance sheet. That includes our deposits and that's where you see the net interest income has improved significantly. NII, excluding global markets, which we disclose each quarter, troughed in the third quarter of 2020 at $9.1 billion, and it's now $5.4 billion higher on a quarterly basis at $14.5 billion in the first quarter of '23, and that's the acid test of managing the entire balance sheet. So, let's turn now to Slide 12 and focus on net interest income. On a GAAP non-FTE basis, NII in the first quarter was $14.4 billion and the FTE NII number was $14.6 billion. Focusing on FTE, net interest income increased $2.9 billion from the first quarter of 2022 or 25%, while our net interest yield improved 51 basis points to 2.2%. The improvement was driven by rates, and that includes reductions in securities premium amortization. Average Fed fund rates are up 440 basis points year-over-year. Relative to that increase in Fed funds, which has benefited all of our variable rate assets, the rate paid on our total deposits rose 89 basis points and the rate paid today on interest-bearing deposits is up 133 basis points. Average loan growth of $64 billion also aided the year-over-year NII improvement. Turning to a linked-quarter discussion, NII of $14.6 billion is down $222 million from Q4, and that's primarily driven by the continued impact of lower deposit balances and the mix shift into interest-bearing. It's also influenced by lower global markets NII, which, remember, still gets passed through to clients via higher non-interest income as part of the trading revenue. Excluding the $262 million decline in global markets' NII, the banking book NII of $14.5 billion, that was modestly higher as the benefit of increased short interest rates, some modest loan growth and some deposit favorability was offset by two less days of interest in the quarter. Turning to asset sensitivity on a forward basis, the plus 100 basis point parallel shift at March 31st stands at $3.3 billion of expected NII over the next 12 months from our banking book. 96% of that sensitivity is driven by short rates. Summary, the first quarter NII was $14.6 billion in this quarter on an FTE basis and that was a little better than our $14.4 billion expectation as we began the quarter since deposits and rate pass-throughs were both modestly better. Looking forward, based on everything we know about interest rates and customer behavior, we expect second quarter NII on an FTE basis to be around 2% lower compared to Q1. So, think about that NII as about $14.3 billion FTE, plus or minus, driven by expected deposit movements as well as lower global markets' NII, which again is offset in the trading revenue. So, let me remind you of some of the caveats when it comes to that NII guidance. First, importantly, it assumes that interest rates in the forward curve materialize and that includes one more hike and then a couple of cuts in 2023. We also expect funding costs for global markets client activity to continue to increase based on those high rates. And, as noted, the impact of that is still offset in non-interest income, and that obviously assumes our current client positioning and the forward rate expectations. We continue to expect modest loan growth. So, that's in our NII expectation as well, and it's driven by credit card and, to a lesser degree, commercial. And then, finally, we just expect lower deposits and rotational shifts towards interest-bearing, really for three reasons. First, we expect further Fed balance sheet reductions to continue to reduce deposits for the industry. Second, we anticipate lower wealth management deposits in the second quarter. That's pretty typical due to the seasonal impact of clients paying income taxes and, to a lesser degree now, a continuation of balance movement seeking better yields off-balance sheet. And, third, we just continue to expect some of the rotation of commercial deposits towards interest-bearing. Okay. Let's go to Slide 13, we'll talk about expense. And here what you can see is, in the first quarter, our expenses were $16.2 billion, that's up $700 million from the fourth quarter and it's driven by seasonal elevation from payroll taxes, mostly at $450 million, a little bit from higher FDIC insurance expense, that was another $100 million this quarter, and the cost of adding people, call that another $100 million. We ended the first quarter with a little more than 217,000 people at the company, that was 260 people more than year-end. During the quarter, we welcomed 3,000 additional people into the company in January, that's due to outstanding offers that we extended in the fourth quarter. That meant that our headcount peaked in January. That's a little more than 218,000. And, at the end of last week, we were down to 216,000. We continue to expect that to move lower over time and we expect, by the end of the second quarter, our full-time equivalent headcount will be roughly 213,000, excluding our summer interns. As we look forward to the next quarter then, we would expect Q2 expense to benefit from the reduction of the seasonal elevation of payroll tax in Q1, and we would also expect to see expense reductions coming from headcount reductions through attrition over time and our operational excellence work. So, we expect expense in Q2 to be around $400 million or $500 million lower than Q1, so think of that as around $15.8 billion, plus or minus, in Q2. And then further, we just expect continued sequential expense declines in the third quarter and then again in the fourth quarter as we benefit from continued headcount discipline and attrition through time. Now turn to asset quality on Slide 14, and I want to start the credit discussion by saying, once again, asset quality of our customers remains healthy and net charge-offs continue to rise from their near historic lows. Net charge-offs of $807 million increased $118 million from the fourth quarter. That increase was driven by credit card losses as higher late-stage delinquencies flowed through to charge-offs. For context, the credit card net charge-off rate was 2.21% in this first quarter and that compares to 3.03% in the fourth quarter of '19 pre-pandemic. Provision expense was $931 million in Q1, and that included a $124 million reserve build. That's obviously less than the $403 million build we took in the fourth quarter, and it reflects modest loan growth and an ever so slightly improved macroeconomic outlook that, on a weighted basis, continues to include an unemployment rate still north of 5% as we end 2023. We included a slide in the appendix this quarter that highlights the mix and credit metrics of our commercial real estate exposure. And I just wanted to remind everyone here, we've been very intentional around our client selection, very intentional around portfolio concentration, and deal structure over many years and, as a result, we've seen NPLs and realized losses that remain quite low for this portfolio. We had a total of $66 million of commercial real estate losses in 2022. 70% of that was in office loans and that resulted in an annualized loss rate of 26 basis points. In the first quarter, to give some perspective, our office loan losses were $15 million. We have roughly $73 billion in commercial real estate loans outstanding, that's less than 7% of our loan book. It's highly diversified by geography, and no part of the country represents more than 22% of the book. It's also very diversified across property type. Within property type, our office portfolio was $19 billion, it's about 2% of our total loans. The portfolio is roughly 75% Class A properties. And when we originate, they are typically around 55% loan-to-value. Even though we've seen some property value declines, this exposure still remain well secured. $3.6 billion is classified as reservable criticized. And even on the most recent refreshes on our toughest loans, we still have 75% LTVs. In our office book, $4 billion is scheduled to mature this year, another $6 billion in 2024, with the remainder spread over the following years. So, we continue to feel that the portfolio is well-positioned and adequately reserved given the current conditions. On Slide 15, for completeness, we highlight the credit quality metrics for both our consumer and commercial portfolios. And, with that, I'm going to turn it back to Brian to talk about the lines of business. Brian Moynihan : Thank you, Alastair. And we're going to begin on Slide 16. So, I want to bring us back to the things that drive the long-term value of this franchise and the value for you, our shareholders. Every business segment grew customers and accounts organically in the quarter and use digital tools and capabilities to drive engagement even deeper and also to drive customer satisfaction to industry-leading levels. On Slide 16, we've highlighted some of the important elements of organic growth. I won't go through all the line items here, but, in consumer, we saw -- we opened 130,000 net new checking accounts, 1.3 million credit card accounts, and 9% more investment accounts, that aided to record quarter one consumer investment flows. Consumer also has now -- have -- has had 17 quarters of positive net new checking accounts. In global wealth, we had a record quarter, adding 14,500 net new wealth relationships. In global banking, we had our clients increase the number of products per relationship. In global markets, as we said earlier, Jim DeMare and team had one of the highest quarters of sales and trading. The other elements of earnings the management team remains focused on throughout this inflationary environment is our expense management efforts and -- but, even given those, we continue to make investments in the future. We continue to streak up operating leverage in our account and you can see that on Slide 17 -- in our company and you can see that on Slide 17. We now had seven quarters of operating leverage. The efficiency ratio went to 62%, and the nominal dollars of expenses we have today are similar to what we had 10 -- eight, nine, 10 years ago. As we go to Slide 18, let's talk about individual businesses, and consumer banking first. For the quarter, consumer banking earned 31 -- $3.1 billion on good organic revenue growth and delivered its eighth consecutive quarter of strong operating leverage, while we continue to invest in future. Top-line revenue grew 21%. Expenses rose 11%. These results demonstrate the true value of the $1 trillion deposit franchise and the deep relationship we have with the clients in that business. The business continues to have $700 billion in excess deposits over its loan balances. And, as we said earlier, we grew checking accounts $2.5 million -- 2.5 million new checking accounts, since the pandemic started. Solid earnings growth of 4% understates the success of this business as prior year included reserve releases, while we built reserves this quarter. On a pre-tax pre-provision basis PPNR grew 34% year-over-year. I'll also note that the revenue growth overcame a decline in service charges as a result of us lowering our NSFOD charges for customers several quarters ago. The expense in the consumers reflect the continued business investments for growth, including adding relationship associates, further develop increases in the cost of technology and implementation of new tools. As you think about this business, remember, much of the company's minimum wage hikes during 2022, the ones we made mid-year in addition to our March of $25 an hour, impact this business more than any other business. However, it has helped drive the attrition in this business in half compared to last year this quarter. On Slide 19, you can see some of the digital statistics around consumer. We believe that those digital tools, our customers have access to it, are the key to growing and retaining customer relationships. These tools also help us deliver more efficiently. We now have 45 million users actively engaged with our digital properties. They login 1 billion times a month. Erica, our artificial intelligence-driven personal assistant, saw usage rise 35% just in the past year. The number of our customers using Zelle grew 21% in the past year. Remember, these aren't new functionalities just being put in place, these are growing off a high scale and showed the Bank of America impact on these products. On Zelle, remember, back in mid-2021, Zelle transactions crossed the number of checks written for our clients. Now, at 60% higher, less than two years later. And you can see the growth in digital sales that continues. We remained focused on growing the customer base and delivering the best-in-class tools and service that make us more efficient and more important to our clients in the consumer business, and Dean Athanasia and team continue to do a good job with respect to those goals. On Slide 20, we move to wealth management. We had good results, earning about a little over $900 million after tax for the quarter. These results were down from last year, as Alastair said, as asset management fees fell with the negative market levels in equity and fixed income. Those fees were mitigated by the beneficial impact of revenue from the sizable banking business within this line of business for us. As I noted a moment ago, both Merrill and the Private Bank saw organic revenue growth and provided solid client flows at $25 billion in the quarter. Our assets under management flows of $15 billion reflects some of the movement in deposits noted earlier, but we also saw a $33 billion of brokerage flows. Expenses reflects lower revenue related incentives, but also reflects continued investments in the business as we continue to add financial advisors. We've added more than 650 wealth advisors in the past year alone. As we move forward, we are excited to have Eric Schimpf and Lindsay Hans lead this business. They work closely with Katy Knox to drive our global wealth and investment management business across the company. As we go to global wealth and investment management digital on Slide 21, you can see the statistics here. Just as with the consumer business, these clients become more and more digital engaged across time. Our advisors have led the way in driving a personal-driven advice model, supplemented by our digital tools. On Slide 21, you can see the client digital adoption rate of 84% with Merrill and the Private Bank is over 90%. More than 75% embrace digital delivery of their statements, which, as a key tool of their service, providing more convenience for them and our advisor. Erica and Zelle interactions continue to grow here also, even among these wealthy clients. On Slide 22, you see the global banking results. This business produced very strong results, growing revenue 19% year-to-year to $6.2 billion. The business earned $2.6 billion after tax. While investment banking remained sluggish, our global treasury services business has been robust, leading to strong revenue performance. Loan activity has been good across this business also. As noted earlier, the deposit flows appear to have stabilized in March and we benefitted from some customer flows during the flight to safety during the quarter. The company's overall investment banking fees were $1.2 billion in quarter one. And while down from quarter one '22, we saw a modest improvement from quarter four of '22. Provision expense declined year-over-year as prior year's reserve builds compared to release in the current period. Credit quality of this business, again, remains very strong. Expense increased 10% year-over-year, driven by strategic investments in the business, including relationship manager hiring and technology costs. Digital engagement, as shown on Slide 23, with our global banking customers. These commercial customers continue to grow in importance as treasuries and others appreciate the ease of doing business with us through these tools. While the volume of transactions in sheer numbers [aren't] (ph) the same as consumer, the volume of money moved is tremendous. Next business, we'll go towards our global markets business on Slide 24. Jim DeMare and the team had another strong quarter of results, growing year-over-year earnings to nearly $1.7 billion after tax. The continued themes of inflation due to political tensions and central banks changing monetary policies around the globe drove volatility in the bond and equity markets, which his team did a good job of managing. As a result, this quarter, we saw a strong performance in our credit trading business, particularly in mortgages and muni trading and macro trading again fared well buoyed by strong client activity and secured financing. Investments made in this business over the last few years continued to produce favorable results. Just to focus on the sales and trading numbers alone, ex-DVA, revenue improved 9% year-over-year to $5.1 billion. FICC improved 29%, while equities were down 19% compared to quarter one of 2022. Year-over-year expense increased 8%, primarily driven by continued investments as stated in this business. Finally, on [Slide 5] (ph), you can see the all other shows a modest loss, which includes the $220 million losses in securities sold, as Alastair mentioned earlier. And last, I would note our 10% effective tax rate this quarter continues to benefit us from a strong business with clients, supporting environmental investments, in-housing investments to produce tax benefits. Excluding those and the other discrete tax benefits, our tax rate would have been 26%. So, in summary, a strong quarter by our team delivered for you, our shareholders, operating leverage, organic growth, strong credit, capital return, and strong ROTCE. With that, let's jump to Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global. Your line is open. Jim Mitchell : Hey, good morning, guys. Maybe just one question on the NII trajectory. You guys remain asset-sensitive in the banking book, but the forward curve is -- I think you pointed out currently expect three rate cuts by the end of the year. If that plays out, how do you think about that impact on NII in the back half of the year? What are the puts and takes as we think about NII beyond 2Q? Alastair Borthwick : So, Jim, I think, right now, the expectations for the market in terms of whether or not there'll be another hike in May, that's bouncing around pretty good. Similarly, you've got a question of whether or not there's two cuts at the back half or three. So, we're operating with the same information you are. We're looking at the forward curve day-to-day thinking that through. At the same time, we're looking at our deposit balances. They're performing kind of the way we would think and we're competing for rate paid. So, I'd say, generally speaking, at this point, we feel pretty good about NII. It's obviously going to be up this year pretty significantly. And, look, we don't provide guidance for the full year for a very simple reason, it just comes down to -- it's very difficult to predict what the Fed is going to do six months and nine months out. But let me put it this way, we can see where our consensus is. Consensus is right around $57 billion, plus or minus. That's sort of the number that would imply us up for the year, 7% to 8%. I mean, I think, we're pretty comfortable there, but it's just so many moving parts, that's why we don't provide the guidance. Jim Mitchell : No, that's all fair. And maybe just pivoting to the trading business, you had another strong quarter and outperformed peers in the fixed income business. Is there anything unusually strong there? Or do you believe you guys have made some sustainable market share gains in that business given your recent investments? Alastair Borthwick : Well, I think, the team has done a really good job. Brian talked about that. A couple of years ago, we made a decision as a team that it was important for us to invest more in that business and we did that. And we've made pretty significant investments in equities and in fixed income. And we felt like, in particular, we could continue to grow our macro businesses, which we've done, and that's what has done a really good job until this quarter. This quarter, we just happen to fire on more cylinders, particularly in FICC, because this quarter we had a great quarter for our micro products and you kind of expect that, because it was a better quarter for them. We've had positive returns there. So, mortgages, credit, munis, financing, futures, FX, all of them had a pretty good quarter and, I think, Jim and the team are just executing at a really high level. So, they just got to keep at it. Jim Mitchell : Fair enough. Thanks for taking my questions. Operator : We'll take our next question from Erika Najarian with UBS. Your line is open. Erika Najarian : Hi, good morning. Alastair, just a clarification. You gave us the quarterly expected trajectory for expenses. Do you still expect to hit $62.5 billion or so of full year expenses in '23? Alastair Borthwick : Right now, that's our expectation. I mean, we're 90 days into the quarter -- I'd say into the year rather. Obviously, as we're looking forward, we see -- we know the headcount is coming down, so that's going to be a tailwind all the way through the course of the year. So, we don't have any change in our expectations right now. We're going to see how the year develops. We still got a little bit of a headwind in terms of something like our sales and trading business having a very good revenue year, and we're still investing in the business. So, it'll be a dog fight, particularly as we get into the back half of the year, but we still feel good about where we are with respect to the expense. Erika Najarian : Got it. And my second question is for Brian. Brian, you've produced a significant amount of revenue this quarter and grew your CET1. At the same time, I think that a lot of investors are looking down the path of significant macro uncertainty. As we take that into account, how should we think about the buyback activity going forward, especially ahead of the stress test results in June? Brian Moynihan : I think, you saw this quarter, we continue to adopt our basic, or apply our basic principles, which is we support the growth in our customer base, we pay the dividends that are -- what we think is the rational rate, and then we use the rest to basically return to use for the share buybacks. Yeah, we're in the middle of stress test as you just mentioned. We'll have to see the results of that. We also -- but the good news is, we crossed 11.40% this quarter, which basically is an excess -- has a cushion on top of what we need for the first quarter of next year. And so, we'll continue to follow our basic principles. So, we're -- we feel good -- very good about our capital and you should expect us to continue to follow the idea to pay the dividend or grow organic -- support the organic growth, pay the dividend and buyback shares, but we've got to get through the near-term sort of what goes on in our business every year at this time. Erika Najarian : Got it. Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Your line is open. Ken Usdin : Good morning. Hey, I just wondering on the deposit side, if you can help us understand, there is obviously the ongoing mix shift, which you referred to and gave us a lot of great detail on it. I'm just wondering, as you think forward, how much more mix shift are you expecting in terms of DVAs as a percentage of total deposits? And how do you expect that to also look as you think across the businesses with regards to just where customers are moving funds incrementally? Thank you. Brian Moynihan : Yeah. I think, Ken, we think this -- everybody thinks this as a big bulk thing, Bank of America, but it's really -- and then looks at broad categories of interest-bearing and non-interest bearing accounts and treasury. You have to really think about customer bases and what they do with their money. And so, there is transactional cash, whether that's for consumer running their household day-to-day or a wealthy consumer running their household day-to-day, which may have different level of expenses. And then, the commercial customers, who run their business day-to-day and then have excess cash from that if they are successful, and then how they all play that through. So I think -- we think, transactional cash and investment cash. You've seen a lot of investment cash as -- so to speak. As Alastair mentioned earlier, we price competitively for that, that moves around. But the good news is, we have a massive investment platform where we put that money to work for our customers if they don't need to manage their day-to-day household. So, in our NII estimates, our view of what happens in the future, I think, the key for the consumer business is to remember that, they've got $700 billion of excess deposits over its loans. It's generating a lot of excess deposits that grew $300-odd billion from pre-pandemic, it has been stable. The checking balances, if you look at those charts we gave you, they show you the near-term movement are stable. That generates at a total all-in cost of 10 basis points to 15 basis points, a lot of the value in our franchise, and meaning -- including interest-bearing part of that franchise when you think about deposits across time and in like businesses. So, you'd expect some of those trends to continue in terms of customers have excess cash, putting it to work differently. Here, we expect the deposit rates to move to continue to match the market. But the broad value of this deposit franchises driven by the money people leave us, because it's transactional cash, which is a motion, and we don't pay interest on, and that is both the consumers, wealthy customers and businesses. So, it's hard. It's a very detailed question of which we spent a lot of time looking at or the team does, as you might imagine. Ken Usdin : Okay. And the other question is just then, Alastair you walked through how you've been changing the composition of the securities portfolio and still benefiting from those variable rate swaps. I'm just wondering if you can help us understand what happens from here in terms of -- or should you continue to get benefits from those variable rate swaps? And then, also just -- do you -- have you done any positioning -- repositioning underneath the surface? It looks like there were some securities losses. So, how much room do you have to continue to kind of rework the portfolio and grind more income out of the book even as you shrink it? Alastair Borthwick : Yeah. So, Ken, think about -- I mean, the easiest way to think about those treasuries, they're swapped to floating, so they're essentially cash. And, actually, this quarter, we ended up converting some of them into cash, just because it's simpler, it's simpler for everyone to understand, and this is, obviously, a pretty good bid for treasuries this quarter. So, we just converted them into cash. That's what accounted for some of the securities loss there, it was a couple hundred million. But I think the way to think about it is, as the overall securities portfolio -- remember, we've got cash, we've got available-for-sale, you can always think about that as enhanced cash, and we've got hold-to-maturity, as that continues to pay down, we're just sweeping it right now into cash. That's something I've talked about in the last couple of quarters. And we're putting in cash, because: number one, it's a really high-yielding asset; number two, it gives us a lot of options during a period of volatility. So, pretty straightforward at this point. Ken Usdin : Okay. Got it. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Mike Mayo : Hi. Well, I guess, the topic of the day, week and the month is, to what degree are your assets matched with your liabilities? And I'm staring at Slide 11, and you've seen the front page of many papers, highlighting your unrealized securities losses. You highlight the yield on your securities at 2.6%. You highlighted your held-to-maturity portfolio at eight years, that would all suggest to some that you're not so well matched. On the other hand, what you don't provide or at least I didn't see it, the change in the value of your deposits or even the duration of your deposit. So, the basic question is, can you describe to what degree your assets are matched with your liabilities? And where you think you may have been off or on the mark? Alastair Borthwick : Yeah. So, Mike, I'll start. Brian can add anything he chooses to. But one of the reasons that we spend as much time laying out the deposit franchise is because in a rising rate environment, you'd expect obviously that bond markets are going to turn negative. And, at the same time, you and we have been expecting, as rates go up, the NII would rise, because the deposits are so much more valuable in that environment. What we laid out for you and for everyone to see is just how broad and stable and diversified is this deposit base. We think it's very long-tenured. That's why we're laying out some of these things around just how long the relationships are in consumer and in wealth and in global banking, and it's one of the reasons why... Mike Mayo : Alastair -- hey, Alastair, if I can just interrupt, just when you say long-tenured, can you put any numbers around that range? Because I think that's the one biggest most important number. If you could just -- some kind of frame that a little bit? Alastair Borthwick : Yeah. If you took a look at Slide number 9, we've tried to lay that out for you. So, you take a look at -- in consumer, for example, you're talking about 67% of the clients have been with us for more than 10 years. That's pretty long-tenured. I know from my time in the commercial bank, our clients on average were 17 years with us. You have long operational deposits in all of these businesses. So, that's what we're trying to lay out in front of everyone, so you can see that. Mike Mayo : Okay. I'm sorry, I interrupted, but go ahead. Alastair Borthwick : Now, I can't remember where it was. Mike Mayo : You were talking about the unrealized securities loss, the NII went higher, that's part of the benefits of having... Alastair Borthwick : No. I think, look, what I'm trying to convey to you too, Mike, and you know how this works, we've got to balance all of this, because we have to think about the entire balance sheet. And there's a lot going on with the entire balance sheet. And so, what we're trying to do is invest that excess, which has existed now in hundreds of billions for many, many years. We've got to invest it the best way we can. And the way we do that, we talk about balancing it, it's we're -- number one, trying to make sure we grow capital. We've done that. We're up 100 basis points there in the last year. Number two, we're trying to grow liquidity. We added $23 billion in this past quarter. Number three, we're trying to grow earnings. We're at $8.2 billion, it's one of our best earnings quarters ever. So, look, we can always be better. You know that we're taking the portfolio and we're just making it smaller, it's run off now six quarters in a row. We're taking all of that and flowing it into cash and loans. That's what we've been doing. We'll just continue doing that, and the portfolio is going to get smaller and shorter overtime. And when you look at the asset sensitivity now, relative to rates going up 100 or rates going down 100, we're pretty balanced there too. We're sort of up $3.3 billion if rates go up 100. We're down $3.6 billion, if rates go down 100, so we feel like we're in a pretty balanced place and lot of flexibility at this point. Mike Mayo : And then just a follow-up. I guess, some will take your greatest strength as a weakness, that is you don't pay as much on deposits as others. I estimate that you have the lowest cycle-to-date deposit beta. And so, what is it that keeps your customers around if you're not going to pay them as much? Alastair Borthwick : Well, I think, if you look at the value proposition that we're talking about, if you go to the consumer business, for example, we've invested so much in client experience, whether it's the financial centers, renovation, whether it's the new -- the people that we've added in that business over a long period of time, whether it's the digital, the mobile, preferred rewards, ours is a relationship model and it has been. And if you look then -- like, just think about this quarter, look at the organic growth in consumer again, that's a 130,000 net new checking, 17 quarters in a row. Based on that relationship value proposition, that's what we're attracting. If you go to the wealth management business, this was a record quarter for net new households for Merrill Lynch and a record for the Private Bank, this quarter. That tells you we're offering people something that's valuable. And then, we added 35,000 new bank accounts for people in our wealth management franchise. So, that again is a significant indicator that what we're offering as value to people. And if I were to go back to my old business in business banking and commercial banking, they're adding new logos and new clients over time in a way that we're really happy with right now. So, I think, the ultimate answer is, we are a purpose-driven company who put our clients' interests first. That is helping make their financial lives better. And in this period of time, people want stability and that's what we offer. Mike Mayo : All right. Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Your line is open. Glenn Schorr : Hi, thanks. Maybe an easy one up first. It wasn't noticeable, but do you feel like there was a flight-to-quality benefit during the March Madness? I would have thought that people would have flocked to the safety of BofA during times like that, but you didn't comment specifically on that. So, thanks. Alastair Borthwick : So, we're going to decline, Glenn, to give a specific number. We're pretty confident we saw noticeable flight to safety. And it comes in two parts. Part one is, during a period like March 10th and in around that week or two. And then just the second part that comes with onboarding clients over a period of time, who are trying to move operational accounts here and that takes a while, that has a lag. So, you can think about, we get some of the deposits quite quickly, but relationships take longer time to build and onboard. So, you can see from our numbers, it was improving before the disruption. We've chosen not to put an exact number on it, because there are typical ebbs and flows in any given quarter, leading up especially to a payroll end of quarter. But, generally speaking, I'd say, we were improving anyway. A lot of that is just organic growth, but we obviously benefited. Glenn Schorr : Okay. You noted though one more hike and then cuts through the back half of the year, that's the forward curve. What's interesting is the Fed doesn't have the same forward curve as the market has. So, I'm curious if you could talk to the sensitivity of what if there are no cuts, how much of that helps your forward NII thought process? Alastair Borthwick : Well, we do use the forward curve, because we feel like it's the most kind of dispassionate assessment with the most information out there in the market from the broader set of people and, importantly, it's not just us making it up. So, we use the forward curve. And I even mentioned during my remarks, things are bouncing around, is it one hike? Is it zero? Is it two cuts? But the sensitivity that we provide around up 100 or down 100 is probably the best we can offer at this stage. And then, depending on how things develop, and they are developing quickly, it will allow you to adjust the model accordingly. Glenn Schorr : The last simple one is, held-to-maturity, you talked a lot about, I think the answer is, I know it, but I'll ask it bluntly anyway. So, you don't feel like you have to do anything material with your unrealized loss [indiscernible]. I get it, it's in treasuries, it's swaps, it's agency mortgages, you don't have a credit issue. But at this point, given the stability, your deposit base, loan growth, capital growth, do you feel like you can just kind of ride it out and grind it down? Alastair Borthwick : Correct. Right now, that's exactly what we've been doing. We've communicated that pretty clearly and that's what we're continuing to do. It just keeps getting smaller and shorter. Glenn Schorr : Thank you. Appreciate it. Operator : We'll go next to Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Steven Chubak : Hey. Good morning. Brian Moynihan : Good morning, Steven. Steven Chubak : So, Alastair, you had mentioned some of the strong KPIs that you're seeing within GWIM, at the same time the business did see a pretty material decline in pre-tax margins, both sequentially and year-on-year. I wanted to better understand how the business might evolve under some of the new leadership? And how we should just be thinking about the margin trajectory? I wanted to better understand how you're balancing investment needs with goal of delivering continued profitability? Brian Moynihan : The margin came down largely because you had to sort of incremental hit to the investment side revenue as the markets fell year-over-year, but we'd expect that margin to move back up to its more traditional 20%, 25% to 30%. But you also have to remember, they are a big beneficiary or hit of the elevated payroll taxes and other things in the first quarter, because as a percentage of our compensation in the company, they're not a small amount. So -- but we expect that to move back in the high-20%s. But we have been working on this business to continue to improve the digitization of the services side of it. So, basically, if you think about it, you get [a dollar's worth] (ph) of the revenue and you take about half past the compensation in the financial advisory grids and the other payouts, and then we take the rest of it and convert it to about a 30% deposit, the other half and convert about 30 percentage points or 60% at the profit pre-tax this quarter, down a little bit, because of the payroll. So, we feel very good about where we stand on a relative basis, but one of the things the team continues to work on across Eric and Lindsay and Katy is to drive operational excellence to new level in that business, because we believe that there is still a lot of costs that can come out around the simplicity -- more simple, straightforward products, the delivery of those products, the paper-based usage and things like that. And then, also, remember, we are making investments in advisors. We have 4,000 plus trainees in the businesses across the company, and we believe it the best advisors one is growing at our -- with our own company, and we continue to do that and that's a drag on the P&L that we're willing to take to make sure we have the advisor growth in the future. Steven Chubak : Helpful color, Brian. And just for my follow-up, I was hoping, either you or Alastair could provide just an update on expectations around upcoming regulatory developments, specifically higher scenario planning for Basel IV, any expectations around the FDIC special assessment? There are a lot of items that have been floated just given recent events and the SBV fallout. I was hoping to get some perspective just in terms of regulatory mark-to-market. Brian Moynihan : I mean, I think we don't have anything more than you do in a broad sense, but I think, at the end of day, I think this industry has extremely strong capital liquidity and capabilities. We just demonstrated through the pandemic and then through the aftermath of the pandemic and then through inflation and then through a tightening cycle, that hasn't happened before. So, we feel good about where the industry stands, and I think people have to step back and think about it overall. And then, frankly, this industry in the United States is so much stronger than Europe. It has so much capital per square inch, so to speak, than Europe does to get to ratios, which on numbers are lower, but the amount of capital to get there is pretty unbelievable. So, we have twice the capitals of European counterparts of similar size and our ratios are considered to be lower. So, obviously, let's say, pull this together, they got to make sure they aren't counting the beans in different ways or the gold plating and other things in the United States. So, hopefully, people will start to see the wisdom and making sure they are careful here and we'll see that play out, but we don't have any special understanding. Steven Chubak : All right. Thanks for taking my questions. Operator : We'll take our next question from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Matt O'Connor: Good morning. Just a quick clarification on the balance sheet and a several questions. The cash obviously went up a lot and you did allude to that moving some of those securities to cash, but the short-term borrowings was also up a lot. And I didn't know if that just to kind of hold more liquidity in the current environment and we should assume that continues, which I think weighs on NIM, but not the [NII] (ph) dollars, or was that just temporary in 1Q and we shouldn't pay too much attention to the period-end trends there? Alastair Borthwick : It's a little bit of both, Matt. You've got -- first quarter is just normally a seasonal build for us, so that happens, and a little bit of borrow. And you're right, it doesn't impact NIM, because you can invest it in cash three-way and there's no drag there, but it may hurt NOI slightly at the margin by a little bit. Matt O'Connor: Okay. All right. So, I think, you meant to say, it doesn't hurt the NII dollars that much, but it hurts the NIM percent, right? Alastair Borthwick : Correct. Matt O'Connor: Yeah. Okay. And then, separately, any kind of trend to call out in spending in March? Some of your peers talked about a slowdown in March, and you highlighted kind of for the full quarter, debit and credit card was up 6% year-over-year and total payments up 9%. Any kind of intra-quarter trends that you want to point to? Brian Moynihan : I think, we saw in the first part of the quarter -- first quarter, being a little bit -- a little bit softer and then we saw it kick back up in March. So far in April, it's still early. It's probably a little lower than it was for the month of March, but it's a couple of weeks since. So, we got to be a little careful about that just due to the different ways vacations fall and things like that. So -- but it's -- over the course of last year, the total spending year-over-year increases have slowed down and I think that means that's a precursor to the economy being a little bit slower and that we're seeing and then frankly consumers being more careful in the use of the cash, because the cash in their accounts -- in our accounts, especially for the lower income cohorts continues to build honestly. From peak last April, it fell down a little bit all the course of the year, and it's built back up in the first part of this year. So, we'll see that play out. There's been a delay in some of the tax returns as you know this year that pushes them from quarter-to-quarter, but stay tuned. I think, it's a little early to call, but it is a little softer in the first part of the April here. Matt O'Connor: Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : We'll go next to Vivek Juneja with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open. Vivek Juneja : Hi. Thanks. Just a couple of questions. I wanted to just clarify the shift to interest-bearing from non-interest bearing. I know you said you expect that to continue. Do you expect the pace of that to slow, or is it still -- it's still running very high or even to accelerate? Any color on that? Alastair Borthwick : Yeah. I'd expect it to slow over time, Vivek, because we're getting pretty close now to Q4 '19 levels anyway, which was the last peak. And, also, if you think about the big driver, it tends to be global banking. And as rates are rising, clients are doing their rotation, but we're getting towards the end of the hikes now, we would think. So, you'd anticipate there'll be a little bit of a lag there. But, generally speaking, I'd expect it to slow at some point and I think we're probably getting close now. Vivek Juneja : One more, Alastair. Office CRE, you gave the geographical mix in your slides for the total CRE portfolio. Can you give us some similar thing for the office CRE portfolio? Alastair Borthwick : I can do, but I'm going to need to follow-up with you afterwards, because I don't have it in hand. Vivek Juneja : Okay. Thank you. Alastair Borthwick : But I don't think you're going to find anything there other than sort of typical geographic distribution similar to the way we serve our customers around the United States. Vivek Juneja : Yeah. All right. Thanks. Operator : We'll go next to Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Your line is open. Gerard Cassidy : Good morning, Brian. Good morning, Alastair. Brian Moynihan : Good morning. How are you doing? Gerard Cassidy : Alastair, can you elaborate a little further, you talked about, I think in Slide 12, you showed us 100 basis point parallel shift impacts, net interest income by a positive $3.3 billion over the following 12 months. If the rate environment does shift and, maybe, we do start to see lower rates by the end of the year, how quickly can you guys move this from being asset sensitive to neutral or a liability sensitive on the balance sheet? Alastair Borthwick : Well, I think, if you were to take that same metric on the downside, it would be -- probably, be down $3.6 billion for down 100, just to give some idea. And what's happening now is, obviously, as the interest-bearing piece just continues to rise across the company, we've got a hedge now as rates, if and when they start to go back down, it won't be a complete hedge, but it'll be a little bit of a hedge there. And then, you also get something back in terms of global markets NII, that will start leading back positively. So, there's some puts and some takes, but we'll see how that develops over the course of the year. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And then as a follow-up question, in the global banking slide, you guys gave us -- Slide 22, you had a negative provision in this quarter and you referenced that it's an improved macroeconomic outlook. Can you give us some color, what you're seeing there to give you confidence to have a negative provision? And the second, does this also include the recent Shared National Credit exam results in this line item as well? Brian Moynihan : It would always include those results. Those come through continuously. It's -- there's not -- Gerard, there's a change over time, that's a continuous set of things they look at and we always do well on that. And when we say macroenvironment, remember, this business set is credit across the world. So, there's places that we finished up on cleaning up. That allowed us to lease some reserves on one side and then we got to other places that we would have put up reserves, but at the end of the day the overall credit quality here is very strong and very stable. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. Appreciate it. Alastair Borthwick : And you asked the question in commercial, correct? Gerard Cassidy : Yes. Alastair Borthwick : Yeah, okay. So, I mean, I think, just a couple of things going on. Number one, we didn't have any real loan growth. Number two, the asset quality remains terrific. Number three, the macro environment when you look at the blue-chip consensus was ever so slightly better. So, we felt like we were pretty well provided for already. And then, on the commercial side, we had a little bit of exposure run-off in one or two places where we may have been reserved quite conservatively. So, it was all those things added together. Gerard Cassidy : Okay. Actually, Brian and Alastair, you guys obviously have been through a few cycles. Why is commercial so strong? As you and your peers all have really good commercial credit quality, any suggestions on what you're seeing that makes this so good? Alastair Borthwick : Well, their profitability remains in a good place. Cash flows remain in a good place. I think, corporate America learn something from 2009 and 2008. And so, leverage is in a good place. You add all that up, you got a decent environment overall for the economy and that's where we are with respect to credit quality. So, we'll have to watch that over time. But as of right now, it's in terrific shape. Gerard Cassidy : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Betsy Graseck : Hi. Good morning. Alastair Borthwick : Good morning, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : Two questions. One, just keying off the loan discussion just now, could you give us a sense as to how you're thinking about lending standards and any changes in a post [SIVB] (ph) environment? Alastair Borthwick : Well, look, we don't really have a significant change to our risk appetite. We haven't changed our client selection. Those are largely speaking design to be through the cycle. We will obviously adjust on specific concerns about asset quality performance in the sector or outlook. But, I'd say, with respect to our loan growth, it -- what we're seeing at more is, as the Fed raises rates, those rates are changing our customer demand. So, we just don't see as much demand right now for securities-based lending or mortgage, but it's less about credit tightening or standards, it's more about just Fed doing and having the effect that you would expect. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And then two other quickies. One, on the consumer checking account balances in March, was that uptick in part a function of seasonality and end of period, end of pay cycle type of behavior, or is there something more going on there? Brian Moynihan : Well, I think, as always, that's the cohort of pre-pandemic compared to where they were then and now. And they had been sort of bounce around and it leveled for the last six months and they moved up a little bit. This is the time they do move up, because of the tax returns and other things and year-end payments and stuff. But they clearly are going -- they basically are stable from November, December, January. They started increasing in February and then they bounced up a little bit. So, we'll see where it ends up. The clear message is, despite people having said these consumers are spending down their money, it would be out of these balances in mid-2022 or the third quarter, they clearly are still sitting with a fair amount of money in account relative to pre-pandemic times. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And then just lastly, AI, it's been a big topic recently as I'm sure you know. You've got Erica. Just wondering about plans to leverage AI, maybe you are going to be leveraging Erica on that, maybe it's a different credit strategy, but thoughts there would be helpful. Thank you. Brian Moynihan : Yeah. So, Erica, obviously, the basic concept was built for us a number of years -- four or five, six, seven years ago starting and came out -- came into the business. It is a predictive language type of program, where you put in question and then it answers it, but we had to do a special language to make sure it would work with our business, it wasn't a general. So, we did that. Then put us in a condition to start to deploy to our customers, because it's captive to our data, where it's just looking our systems, finding information and giving to clients is really a service capability. And what we've seen is that increase is a clear indicator of how valuable these types of artificial intelligence, natural language processing, predictive technologies can be for customer service and things like that. We've also taken Erica internally and applied it to help us do work and we've seen it have those benefits. Ultimately, we think this has extreme benefits for our company. We think it has a lot -- and you've seen this written about in the computer coding areas. In other words, it could speed up the process of what they used to be called object programing. That goes on. We think it has a lot to do in terms of allowing teammates to work much more quickly and efficiently with our systems and get information out and can make, even someone like me, the ability to do analytics, that I could -- I'd have to send to somebody and have them put, key it in the systems. So there's a lot of value to this. The key question will be, when can you use it without the fear of -- with the -- the reason why a lot of it stopped in our industry and other industries was, it wasn't clear how it worked. It was your data and the outside world's data and how it would interact and pull stuff out and we have to be careful with that. And then, secondly, we have to understand how the decisions are made, being able to stand up to the -- to our customers' demand for us to be fair and, frankly, follow the laws and rules and regulations on lending. So, I think, all that is good, strong -- it's really important thing. So, we're not a neophyte in this sense, actually operating out there, we understand the value of it, but we will carefully apply it and we see a great value. I don't think it's a great value in the next month, but in the overall sense, it will help us continue to manage the headcount down, which we've been doing this quarter. And, remember, we started this company -- management team started with this company in 2010 with 285,000 and 300,000 people working here and we're running the same size company with 216,000 people or bigger company doing more stuff and so all that's been aided by digitization of which is a potential step function change. Betsy Graseck : Thanks so much. Appreciate it. Operator : We'll take our final question at this time. This is a follow-up from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Mike Mayo : Hi. In terms of your guidance for lower expenses in the second quarter, then the third quarter, then the fourth quarter, how much of that is expectations for slower business activity and how much of that is due to expected scale benefits from technology? And I guess the bigger question too is, are you seeing evidence of a banking crisis? Are you seeing evidence of banking recession? And is that part of the reason for the expense guide? Brian Moynihan : No, it not -- Mike, I would say, there could be -- the activity in the first quarter was actually higher in some ways, because of the volatility in the trading side and things like that. So, we aren't expecting -- we're expecting to get scale and operating leverage across activity taking less dollars to do it in the OpEx and the work we do. We had built-up more people, largely because the fear of last year of the turnover rate that is now gone in half in a year, requires us to be hiring a lot to stay ahead of it and then when it slowed down, we built-up people and we're bringing that back down in line. But there is no -- the expenses frankly are just managing the headcount carefully, because that's two-thirds of the expense base and getting more leverage out of the activities. But there's no -- yeah, we'll have more checking accounts, we will have more credit card accounts, we'll do more wires on a given day, we'll do more trades on a given day, and that can ebb and flow, but, overall, we're expecting activity continue to rise. Now, well, loan demand, i.e., people want to borrow another $10 versus the $10 ahead, that's what we say slows down. So that doesn't -- yeah, that's -- but that's not -- that they don't have a loan is that they borrow different amounts of money. Mike Mayo : All right. So, this is really just managing the business, not your reduced investment spends, or anything like that? Brian Moynihan : No, in the investment spend, we're spending, we increase this year versus last year $300 million to $400 million in pure initiative spending and that's going through the run rate as we speak, and we aren't -- we wouldn't cut that, because we think to the point of Betsy's comment, it gives us a chance to continue to leverage the franchise and nowhere is that more evidenced in our consumer business, where the numbers of branches year-over-year are down a few 100 again. Customers are bigger, more stuff's going through, customer delights were an all-time high, attrition is an all-time low, and that's what makes that franchise valuable as you well know and that's by continuing to invest in new capabilities at all-time. Mike Mayo : And last thing, big picture for you, Brian, just the evidence that a recession is coming and the impact on you guys, where are you right now? Is it red? Is it flashing yellow? Or is it green? How has it moved? Just what's your -- what's the temperature? Brian Moynihan : [Candace] (ph) and research teams have been consistent to see after the Fed raises rates this amounts, there would be a, recession they have a mild recession and at that day predicted basically say 0.5% to 1% negative -- annualized negative GDP growth in Q3 and Q4 and Q1 and then back to positive. So I think, in the end of the day, we don't see activity on the consumer side slowing at a pace that would indicate that, but we see, commercial customers are being more careful and things like that. But everything points to relatively mild recession, given the amount of stimulus that was put -- that was paid the people and the money they have leftover, the fact that unemployment is still at 3.5% -- full employment plus. And then the wage growth is slowing in tipping over, so the size of inflation are tipping down but, they're still there, but that translates into good -- relatively good activity. So we see it as a slight recession and we'll see what happens, but we built this company across the last decade even in a stress scenario is that you'll see somewhere in the slides last quarter we didn't reduce because they're the same answer, our stress scenarios are always less than anybody else, because how we built the company through the go through recessions, without a problem, including the pandemic. Mike Mayo : Got it. All right, thank you. Operator : And at this time, I'd like to turn the program back over to Brian Moynihan for any additional or closing remarks. Brian Moynihan : Thank you for your time, and I want to thank my teammates for a great our performance again this first quarter of 2023, a strong quarter of 18% year-over-year EPS growth. The strength and stability and being there for our customers continue to show through -- including strong capital at 11.4%, liquidity at $900 million in GLS. But the most important thing and we just touched on, it was really two things : continued organic growth in our franchise and operating leverage by growing revenue faster in expenses. So, we feel-good about that and look-forward to talking next quarter. Operator : This does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time, and have a wonderful day.",

Lee McEntire : Thank you, Catherine. Good morning, welcome and thank you for joining the call to review our second quarter results. I trust everyone has had a chance to review our earnings release documents. They are available on the Investor Relations section of the bankofamerica.com website, and includes the earnings presentation that will be referring to during the call. I'm going to first turn the call over to our CEO; Brian Moynihan, for some opening comments, before Alastair Borthwick, our CFO, discusses the details of the quarter. Before I do that, let me remind you that we may make forward-looking statements and refer to non-GAAP financial measures during the call. The forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause the actual results to materially differ from expectations are detailed in our earnings materials and SEC filings that are available on the website. Information about our non-GAAP financial measures, including reconciliations to U.S. GAAP, can also be found in our earnings materials that are available on the website. So, with that, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to you, Brian. Thanks. Brian Moynihan : Thanks, Lee, and good morning to all of you, and thank you for joining us. I'm starting on Slide 2 of the earnings presentation. This morning, Bank of America reported one of the best quarters and one of the best first halves net income in the company's history. Our results this quarter once again include solid performance on things we can control by delivering organic growth and operating leverage. We did that in economy that remains healthy that had a slowing rate of growth. It was also a quarter that included volatility from the debate about the debt ceiling, continuation of central bank monetary tightening actions and a slowing in consumer spending and the slowing inflation. As you look at it now, our customer spending patterns now are more consistent with the pre-pandemic, lower growth, lower inflation economy. Before Alastair takes to details, let me summarize Bank of America's quarter two performance. On Slide 2, you can see the highlights. We earned $7.4 billion after tax, and grew earnings per share of 21% over the second quarter of 2022. All business segments performed well, and I want to thank all my teammates for doing so. We grew clients and accounts organically and at a strong pace. We delivered 8th straight quarter of operating leverage, led by 11% year-over-year revenue growth. We further strengthened our balance sheet, improving our common equity Tier 1 ratio more than 110 basis points year-over-year to 11.6%, and we have $867 billion in Global Liquidity Sources. We also produced strong returns for our shareholders with a return on tangible common equity of 15.5%, continuing a streak of many quarters at that level or above. While our business has performed well this quarter, I would particularly highlight our global markets and sales and trading team, and our investment banking teams. Both have appeared to outperform the industry peers, investments made over the past couple of years and global markets capabilities under Jim DeMare's leadership, as well as Matthew Koder's leadership in the global corporate investment banking area allowed us to improve our market shares for both of these people. I'd also note the strong contribution by our middle-market clients and our teammates there led by Wendy Stewart. I'd also like to touch a few additional points before turning the call over to Alastair. These points will help illustrate continued investment in the franchise and work we do to drive growth. Let's start with the organic growth slide on Page 3. On that page, we highlight some of the important elements of organic growth. You can see evidence in every business segment as you look at the page. In consumer, in quarter two, we opened 157,000 net new checking accounts. Consumers now had 18 straight quarters of positive net new checking account growth. Now these are core primary checking accounts across the board, allowing our tremendous deposit franchise to continue to prosper and take market share. While the progress here made pier inch meal over the last three years, we've grown our core customers in consumer checking account customers from 33 million to 36 million. We opened another one million-plus credit card accounts this quarter, and have 10% more investment accounts this year than we did last year in the consumer business. Consumer investment business balances reached a new high of $387 billion aided by a 30% increase in new funded consumer investment accounts year-over-year, and frankly moving our money from our depositors into the market as they have done so. In Global Wealth, we added 12,000 net new relationships in Merrill and the Private Bank, and our advisors open more than 36,000 new banking relationships in the quarter, showing a strong differentiation of our model of fulfilling both investment in banking these for clients. In the past 90 days, we added 190 experienced advisors to our salesforce in addition to digital capabilities to help us deliver at scale. In Global Banking, we added clients and increased number of solutions per relationship. Over the past three years, we've added net new relationship managers and increased our client facing headcount by nearly 10%. We've also improved our tools for prospect colleagues through investments in technology, and it's benefiting our ability to add customers and improve our solutions per existing clients. Year-to-date, we've added over 1,000 new commercial and business banking clients across the United States, which is the same number we added in the full year of last year. Again, operationalizing that ability to do this at scale increases our speed of onboarding these clients. In our global markets area, we saw one of the highest second quarter for sales and trading in our history, so another quarter of good organic growth. To achieve that growth, we are managing our expense trajectory, which Alastair is going to cover, requires inherent efficiency progress from digital and other applied technology across all our units. Digital superiority is key to our operating dynamics. First, it produces a great customer experience resulting strong customer retention and strong customer scores. Second, it ensures our position as a lead transactional bank for our customers, whether they are consumers, companies or investors. Third, it preserves a strong deposit balance as a good price and do the core nature of transactional deposits. And last, but importantly not least, efficiency. So, how we're doing on digital progress? You can see that on Slide 4, first with the consumer. In consumer, we now have 46 million active users that are digitally engaged with our digital platform and are logging over 1 billion times a month. And even with this scale, the stage of maturity logins is up double digits from last year. Customer uses of Erica continues to be at expectations. This was an early application of natural language processing and artificial intelligence that we built in our company, and it continues to learn about with additional use. Interactions with Erica rose 35% in just the past year, and now it's crossed over 1.5 billion client interactions in the first five years of introduction. There's a lot of questions about our artificial intelligence out there, but one [indiscernible] together a series of systems. We have to build a system and it's highly regulated, high customer-focused business, and Erica is one such application you can see its impact. Likewise, Zelle hasn't slowed down either. The number of people using Zelle grew 19% this past year. Remember, these aren't new functionalities at this point, they've been around for years, but they continue to grow very strong growth rates, showing customer desire and acceptance of the activities. You can see the digital sales continue to growth. We continue to have both great high-tech and high-touch options. As part of that, we've added 310 new financial centers since 2019, and by the end of this year, we have refurbished every one of our existing centers in our company. We plan on opening 50 more centers a year for the next few years, which included an expansion in nine new markets we announced a few years ago - a few weeks ago, excuse me Our entrance into these markets is enhanced by digital and leads to strong early success. Just to give you a point of reference, for all the expansion markets over the last several years for branches opened a year or more in those expansion markets, our average deposit balances per those branch are $160 million in each branch. You go to the wealth management digital on Slide 5, you can see that they continue to be the most digitally engaged clients in our company. Our advisors have led the way in driving a personal driven advice model, supplemented by our digital tools. You can see the client adoption rate of 82% in Merrill and 92% in the private bank, 78% have embraced digital delivery as a tool service providing more convenience for them and our advisors. Erica and Zelle also continue expanding these client sets. A new program we announced just a few quarters ago has generated 20,000 digital leads to 7,000 advisors, it's called Advisor Match, matching our clients with advisors of their choice. On Slide 6, you can see the digital engagement of global banking area. Corporate treasury teams and our clients appreciate the ease of doing business with us digitally. CashPro App sign-ins are up nearly 60% from last year, where the value of payments through CashPro App are up 20%. As you can see, every line of business is delivering strong organic growth. Investments made in technology have enabled us to grow industry leading positions in digital tools, while enabling our clients to do great things and making us more efficient. This provides for a very satisfied, stable customer and client base with Bank of America's primary provider. And by doing with a digital application, that also produces operating leverage. On Slide 7, you can see our streak of operating leverage continued in the second quarter of 2023. We're now back in eight quarters in a row. The chart on Slide 7 covers the 8.5 years at 34 quarters, and all but eight of those quarters and you can see those identified. Six of which were in the heart of the pandemic, we've achieved operating leverage. Operating leverage is that simple task of growing revenue at a better growth rate and expense. As I said, Alastair's is going to discuss with you our good and declining expansion trajectory which sets us up to continue to provide operating leverage, even with the shift in economy. In sum, in the quarter, we delivered earnings that are 19% higher and a 15% return on tangible common equity that was driven by continued strong organic growth and operating leverage in a volatile economic environment. Alastair is going to talk to you about a bit more strength we see ahead in our net interest income for the balance of the year and that provides a better start as we think about 2024. You're going hear our expectations for the quarterly decline expenses in the following quarters for the rest of '23, even as we keep investing, and you hear about the resilience of credit and strong trajectory in capital, this all positions us well to continue both our streaks of organic growth and operating leverage. With that, let me turn it over to Alastair. Alastair Borthwick : Thank you, Brian. And on Slide 8, we list the more detailed highlights of the quarter, and then Slide 9 presents a summary income statement, so I'm going to refer to both of those. For the quarter, we generated $7.4 billion in net income, and that resulted in $0.88 per diluted share. A year-over-year revenue growth of 11% was led by a 14% improvement in net interest income, coupled with a strong 10% increase in sales and trading results ex-DVA. Revenue was strong, and it included a few headwinds, and I thought I'd go through those headwinds first. We had lower service charges from both higher earnings credit rates on deposits for commercial clients, and the policy changes we announced in late 2021 to lower our insufficient funds and overdraft fees for our consumer customers. The good news on the consumer piece is year-over-year comparisons get a bit easier starting next quarter, as the third quarter of '22 reflects the full first quarter of these changes. Second, we had lower asset management and brokerage fees as a result of the lower equity and fixed income market levels, and market uncertainty that impacted transactional volumes compared to a year ago quarter. Third, we have a net DVA loss of $102 million this quarter compared to a gain in DVA of $158 million in the second quarter a year ago. We also recorded roughly $200 million in securities losses as we closed out some available for sale security positions and their related hedges, and we put the proceeds and cash. Lastly, and just as a reminder, our tax-rate benefits from ESG investments, and those are somewhat offset by operating losses on the ESG investments which show up in other income. So, this quarter, our tax-rate is a little bit lower and the operating losses are a little bit higher from volume of these deals. So you have to be careful in analyzing the lower tax-rate without considering the operating losses, and that in-turn often offsets what would have been higher revenue elsewhere. Our tax-rate for the full year is expected to benefit by 15% as a result of the ESG investment tax credit deals, and absent of these credits, our effective tax-rate would still be roughly 25%, and we continue to expect a tax-rate of 10% to 11% for the rest of 2023. Expense for the quarter of $16 billion included roughly $276 million in litigation expense which was pushed higher this quarter by the agreements announced last week with the OCC and the CFPB on consumer matters. Asset quality remains solid and provision expense for the quarter was $1.1 billion consisting of $869 million in net charge-offs and $256 million in reserve built. The provision expense reflects the continued trend in charge-offs towards pre-pandemic levels, and it is still below historical levels. The charge-off rate was 33 basis points, and that's only 1 basis point higher than the first quarter and still remains well below the 39 basis points we last saw in Q4 of 2019, when remember, 2019 was a multi-decade low. I'd also use Slide 9 just to highlight returns, and you can see we generated 15.5% return on tangible common equity and 94 basis points return on assets. Let's turn to the balance sheet starting with Slide 10, and you can see our balance sheet ended the quarter at $3.1 trillion, declining $72 billion from the first quarter. A $33 billion or 1.7% reduction in deposits closely matched a $41 billion decline in securities balances through paydowns from the hold to maturity and sales of available for sale securities. Securities are now down $177 billion from a quarter to '22. Cash levels remained high at $374 billion and loans grew $5 billion. As Brian noted, our liquidity remains strong with $867 billion of liquidity, up modestly from the first quarter of '23, and still remains nearly $300 billion above our pre-pandemic fourth quarter '19 level. Shareholders' equity increased $3 billion from the first quarter as earnings were only partially offset by capital distributed to shareholders. AOCI decreased by $2 billion, driven by derivatives valuation and AFS securities values were little changed. So, there is little change in the AOCI component that impacts regulatory capital. Tangible book-value is up 10% per share year-over-year. During the quarter, we also paid out $1.8 billion in common dividends, and we bought back $550 million in shares to offset our employee awards. And last week, we announced the intent to increase our dividend by 9%, beginning in the third quarter. Turning to regulatory capital, our CET1 level improved to $190 billion from March 31st, and the ratio of CET1 improved more than 20 basis points to 11.6%, once again, adding to the buffer over our 10.4% current requirement. While our risk-weighted assets increased modestly in the quarter. Also noteworthy, on July 3rd, we initiated dialog with the Fed to better understand our CCAR exam results, and we remain in discussions today with no news to update as of now. In the past 12 months, we've improved our CET1 ratio by more than 110 basis points, and we've done that while supporting claims for loan demand and returned $11.3 billion in dividends and share repurchases to shareholders. A supplemental leverage ratio was 6% versus our minimum requirement of 5%, and that leaves us plenty of capacity for balance sheet growth. Finally, the TLAC ratio remains comfortably above our requirements. So, let's now focus on loans by looking at average balances, you can see those on Slide 11, and there you can see, average loans grew 3% year-over-year. The drivers of loan growth are much the same. Consumer credit card growth is strong, and then commercial loans grew 4%. The credit card growth reflects increased marketing, enhanced offers and higher levels of account openings over time. And in commercial, we saw a little bit of a slowdown this quarter, driven by higher paydowns from borrowers and weaker customer demand as opposed to any credit availability from us. We are still open for business for loans. While loan growth has slowed, it's generally remained still ahead of GDP and commercial client conversations remain solid as our clients seem to be waiting for some of the economic uncertainty to lift before borrowing further. Slide 12 shows the breakout of deposit trends that's on a weekly ending basis across the last two quarters, and it's the same chart that we provided last quarter. In the upper left, you see the trend of total deposits. We ended the second quarter at $1.88 trillion, down 1.7% with several elements of our deposits seeming to find stability. Given the normal tax seasonality impacts on deposit balances in Q2 and the monetary policy actions, we believe this is a good result. I want to use the other three charts on the page to illustrate the different trends across the last quarter, and more specifically in each line-of-business. In consumer, looking at the top right chart, you see the difference in the movement through the quarter between the balances of low to no interest checking accounts and the higher-yielding non-checking accounts. Here you can also see the low levels of our more rate-sensitive balances in consumer investments and CD balances. And they're both broken out here. In total, we've got still more than $1 trillion in high quality consumer deposits, which remains $274 billion, above pre-pandemic levels. In the second quarter that decline in consumer deposits was driven by higher debt payments, higher spend and seasonal tax activity. And some non-checking balances that rotated from deposits into brokerage accounts. We did see some competitive pressure this quarter within about roughly $40 billion of CD's, as some of the financial institutions pushed prices higher. And at this point with deposits, far exceeding our loans we've not yet felt the need to chase deposits with rate. Broadly speaking, average deposit balances of our consumers remain at multiples of their pre-pandemic level, especially in the lower end of our customer base. Total rate paid on consumer deposits in the quarter rose to 22 basis points, and remains low relative to Fed funds driven by the high mix of quality transactional accounts. Most of this quarter's 10 basis point rate increase remains concentrated in those CD's and consumer investment deposits and together, those represent only 11% of our consumer deposits. Turning to Wealth Management. This business is also impacted by tax payments and normally shows the most relative rate movement because these clients tend to have the most excess cash. The previous quarters trend of clients moving money from lower-yielding sweep accounts into higher-yielding preferred deposits. And moving off-balance sheet on to other parts of the platform seem to stabilize this quarter, and our sweep balances were more modestly down $72 billion. At the bottom right, note the global banking deposits stability. We ended the second quarter at $493 billion down $3 billion from the first quarter. We've now been in this $490 billion to $500 billion range for the past several quarters. And these are generally the transactional deposits of our commercial customers that they use to manage their cash flows. And while the overall balances have been stable, we've continued to see shift towards interest-bearing as the Fed raised rates one more time during the quarter before pausing in June. Non-interest-bearing deposits were 40% of their deposits at the end of the quarter. Focusing for a moment, on average deposits using Slide 13, I really only have one additional point to make. While you've seen the modest downtick in deposits for the past several quarters, as the Fed has removed some accommodation, we just want to note that deposits remain 33% above the fourth quarter 2019 pre-pandemic period. And as you look at the page every segment relative to pre-pandemic is up at least 15%, consumer is up 40%, consumer checking is up more than 50%, and as noted global banking has been right around $500 billion for the past five quarters, and it remains 31%, above pre-pandemic. So let's move to Slide 14. And we'll continue the conversation that we began last quarter around management of excess deposits above loans. In the top left, note the balances in the second-quarter of each year since the pandemic began. The excess of deposits needed to fund loans increased from $500 billion pre-pandemic to a peak of $1.1 trillion in the fall of 2021. And as you can see it remains high at the end of June at $826 billion. In the top right, note that the amount of cash and securities held has increased across time, in-line with the excess deposit trend. And you will also note the mix shift over time. This excess of deposits over loans has been held in a balanced manner across the period shown with roughly 50% fixed longer dated held-to-maturity securities and the rest has been held in shorter dated available-for-sale securities and cash. Cash and the shorter day-to-day FS securities combined was $516 billion at the end of the quarter. And cash of $375 billion is more than twice what we held pre-pandemic and you should expect to see that come down over time. We made these investments, given the mix and transactional nature of our customers deposits, particularly given the excess deposits built. Note also in the bottom left chart, the combined cash and securities yields continue to expand this quarter and remain meaningfully wider than the overall deposit rate paid that's a result of two things. Securities book has seen a steady decline since the fall of 2021, when we stopped adding to it. With less loan funding needs, proceeds from security pay-downs have been deployed into higher-yielding cash and through this action, and the increased cash rates, the combined cash and securities yield has risen further and faster than deposit rates. Deposits at the end of the quarter were paying 124 basis points while our blend of cash and securities has increased to 319 basis points. So, over the past year the deposit cost has risen by 118 basis points, and the cash and securities yield has improved by 164 basis points. And as a reminder, this slide focuses on the banking book because our global markets balance sheet has remained largely market funded. Finally, one very last - one last very important point that I want to make is on the improved NII of our banking book. The NII excluding global markets which we disclose each quarter troughed in the third quarter of 2020 at $9.1 billion, and that compares to $14 billion in the second quarter of 2023, so almost $5 billion higher on a quarter basis, $20 billion per year. That's led to a stronger capital position even as we returned capital to shareholders and supplied capital to our customers in the form of loans and other financing capital. And then more specifically on the hold-to-maturity book, the balance of that portfolio declined again $10 billion from the first quarter, it's down $69 billion since we stopped adding to the book in the third quarter of '21. The market valuation on our hold-to-maturity book, which is in a negative position, worsened $7 billion since March 31, 2023, driven by a 54 basis point increase in mortgage rates. The OCI impact from the valuation of our hedged AFS book modestly improved this quarter. Let's turn to Slide 15, and we can focus on net interest income. On a GAAP or non-FTE basis, NII in the second quarter was $14.2 billion, and the fully tax equivalent NII number was $14.3 billion. So, I'm going to focus on that fully tax equivalent. Here NII increased $1.7 billion from the second quarter of '22 or 14%, while our net interest yield improved 20 basis points to 2.06%. This improvement has been driven by rates which includes securities premium amortization, partially offset by global markets activity, and $137 billion of lower average deposit balances. Average loan growth during the period of $32 billion also aided the year-over-year NII improvement. Turning to a linked quarter discussion, NII of $14.3 billion is down $289 million or 2% from the first quarter, and that's driven primarily by the continued impact of lower deposit balances and mix shift into interest bearing, partially offset by one additional day of interest in the period. Global markets NII increased during the quarter. The net interest yield fell 14 basis points in the quarter, driven by a larger average balance sheet due to the cash positioning we chose and some higher funding costs. This quarter's compression, we believe, was just a little anomalous, driven by our decision late first quarter to position the balance sheet around higher cash levels. Turning to asset sensitivity and focusing on a forward yield curve basis, the plus 100 basis point parallel shift at June 30 was unchanged from March 31, '23, at $3.3 billion of expected NII over the next 12 months in our banking book, and that assumes no expected change in balance sheet levels or mix relative to our baseline forecast, and 95% of the sensitivity remains driven by short rates. A 100 basis point down-rate scenario was unchanged at negative $3.6 billion. Let me give you a few thoughts on NII as we look forward. We still believe NII for the full year will be a little above $57 billion, which would be up more than 8% from full year 2022, and this could include third quarter at approximately the same level as second quarter, so think $14.2 billion, $14.3 billion. And then fourth quarter, somewhere around $14 billion. That's a slightly better viewpoint than we had last quarter for the third and fourth quarter, with a little more stability closer to the second quarter level, and therefore provides a better start point for 2024. So, let's talk through the caveats around our NII comments. First, it assumes that interest rates in the forward curve materialized, and an expectation of modest loan growth driven by credit card. On deposits, we are expecting modestly lower balances led by consumer, and we expect continued modest deposit mix shifts from global banking deposits into interest bearing. The past few months have provided us a little more positive outlook around NII, given the apparent stabilization of some elements of deposits as well as better pricing, and now we'll see how the rest of the year plays out. Okay, let's turn to expense, and we'll use Slide 16 for that discussion. Second quarter expenses were $16 billion, that was down $200 million from the first quarter. And as I mentioned, the second quarter included $276 million of litigation expense. In addition, we also saw a little higher revenue related expense driven by our sales and trading results. Those higher costs were more than offset by the absence of the first quarter seasonal elevation of payroll taxes and savings from a reduction in overall full-time headcount. Now, excluding the 2,500 or so summer interns that we welcomed into our offices over the summer months, our full-time head count was down roughly 4,000 from the first quarter start point to 213,000. That's some good work after peaking at 218,000 in January. Our summer interns will leave us in the third quarter, and hopefully many will return as full-time associates next summer. And at the same time in Q3, we welcomed back about 2,600 new full-time hires as college grads, many of whom interned with us last summer. And that's a very diverse class of associates who are excited to join the company. As we look forward to next quarter, we would expect the third quarter expense to more fully benefit from the second quarter head count reduction, even as we remain in a mode of modest hiring for client-facing positions. Additionally, the proposed notice of special assessment from the FDIC to recover losses from the failures of Silicon Valley and signature banks could add $1.9 billion expense for us, $1.5 billion after tax, and we just remain unsure at this point of timing to record that expense. Let's now move to credit, and we'll turn to Slide 17. Net charge-offs of $869 million increased $62 million from the first quarter, and the increase was driven by credit card losses as higher late-stage delinquencies flowed through to charge-offs. For context, the credit card net charge-off rate was 2.6% in Q2, and remains well below the 3.03% pre-pandemic rate in the fourth quarter of '19. Provision expense was $1.1 billion in Q2, and that included a $256 million further reserve build, that's driven by loan growth, particularly in credit card, and it reflects a macroeconomic outlook that on a weighted basis continues to include an unemployment rate that rises to north of 5% in 2024. On Slide 18, we highlight the credit quality metrics for both our consumer and commercial portfolios. On consumer, we note we continue to see asset quality metrics come off the bottom, and they remain below historical averages. Overall commercial net charge-offs were flat from first quarter. And within commercial we saw a decrease in C&I losses that was offset by an increase in charge-offs related to commercial real estate office exposures. As a reminder, commercial real estate office credit exposure represents less than 2% of our total loans, and this is an area where we've been quite intentional around our client selection, portfolio concentration, and deal structure over many years, and as a result, we've seen NPLs and realized losses that are quite low for this portfolio. In the second quarter we experienced $70 million in charge-offs on office exposure, to write down a handful of properties where the LTV has deteriorated. Our charge-offs on office exposures were $15 million in the first quarter. We pulled forward some of the office portfolio stats provided last quarter in a slide in our appendix for you. Now, we continue to believe that the portfolio is well positioned and adequately reserved against the current conditions. Moving to the various lines of business and their results, starting on Slide 19 with consumer banking, for the quarter, consumer earned $2.9 billion on good organic revenue growth and delivered its 9th consecutive quarter of strong operating leverage, while we continue to invest in our future. Note that top-line revenue grew 15% while expense rose 10%. These segment results include the bulk of the impact of the costs of the regulator agreements from last week. While reported earnings were strong in both periods at $2.9 billion, it understates the success of the business because the prior year included reserve leases while we built reserves this quarter for card growth. EPNR grew 21% year-over-year even with the added cost of the agreements. And the revenue growth overcame a decline in service charges that I noted earlier. Much of this success is driven by the pace of organic growth of checking and card accounts as well as investment accounts and balances, as Brian noted earlier In addition to the litigation noted, expense reflects the continued business investments for growth, and as you think about this business, remember much of the company's minimum wage hikes and the mid-year increased salary in wage moves in 2022 impact consumer banking the most, and that, therefore, impacts the year-over-year comparisons. Moving to wealth management on Slide 20, we produced good results earning a little less than $1 billion. These results were down from last year as asset management and brokerage fees felt the negative impact of lower equity, lower fixed income markets, and some market uncertainty, impacting transactional volume. Those fees were complemented by the revenue from a sizeable banking business, and that remains an advantage for us. As Brian noted earlier, both Merrill and the private bank continued to see strong organic growth and produce solid client flows of $83 billion since the third - since the second quarter '22. Our assets under management flows of $14 billion reflect a good mix of new client money as well as existing clients putting money to work. Expenses reflect lower revenue-related incentives and also reflect continued investments in the business as we add financial advisers. On Slide 21, you see the global banking results, and this business produced very strong results with earnings of $2.7 billion, driven by 29% growth in revenue to $6.5 billion. Coupled with good expense management, this business produced strong operating leverage. Our global transaction services business has been robust. We've also seen a higher volume of solar and wind investment projects this quarter, and our investment banking business is performing well in a sluggish environment. Year-over-year revenue growth also benefited from the absence of marks taken on leveraged loans in the prior-year period. We saw modest loan growth on average year-over-year and link quarter, the utilization rates declined, and more generally, we saw lower levels of demand. As we noted earlier, the deposit flows have stabilized in the $490 billion to $500 billion range over the past several quarters, reflecting the benefits of our strong client relationships. The company's overall investment banking fees were $1.2 billion in the second quarter, growing 7% over the prior year and 4% linked quarter, a good performance in a sluggish environment that saw fee pools down 20% year-over-year. Provision expense declined year-over-year as we built more reserve in the prior year. Expense was held relatively flat year-over-year even as we drove strategic investments in the business, including a relationship management hiring and technology costs, and additionally comparisons benefit from the absence of elevated expense for some regulatory matters in the second quarter of '22. Switching to global markets on Slide 22, we had another strong quarter with earnings growing to $1.2 billion driven by revenue growth of 14% and I'm referring to results excluding DVA as we normally do. The continued themes of inflation, geopolitical tensions and central banks changing monetary policies around the globe. Along with this quarter's debt ceiling concerns, continued to impact both the bond and equity markets. As a result, it was a quarter where we saw a strong performance in both our macro and micro trading businesses. The investments made in the business over the past two years continued to produce favorable results. Year-over-year revenue growth benefited from strong sales and trading results and the absence of marks on leverage finance positions last year. Focusing on-sales and trading ex-DVA revenue improved 10% year-over-year to $4.4 billion. FICC improved 18% while equities was down 2% compared to the second quarter of '22. Year-over-year expense increased 8%, primarily driven by investments in the business and revenue-related costs, partially offset by the absence of regulatory matters in the second quarter of '22. Finally on Slide 23, all other shows a loss of $182 million. Revenue included a $197 million of losses on securities sales and increased volume of solar and wind investment operating losses that create the tax credits for the company. As a result of the increased solar and wind tax deal volume, and their associated related operating losses our effective tax-rate in the quarter was lower at 8%, but excluding ESG and any other discrete tax benefits our tax-rate would have been 26%. So with that, let's stop there and we'll open it up for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question today from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Your line is open. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Good morning, Brian. Good morning, Alastair. Brian, can you give us a view from your standpoint of the - and the new proposal I should say new but the speech by Vice-Chair Barr about the likelihood of capital ratios going up for large banks, like your own and then second, there was a report today, Bloomberg that the capital requirements for holding residential mortgages may go up meaningfully. Any thoughts on that as well? Brian Moynihan : So I think broadly stated, I think as we said by many people that have held the position of the year is a capital on the industry is sufficient. And I think there has been a desire to finish up the Basel 3 those rules will come out we think in a few weeks, and like anything else, we'll deal with and we have 11.6% CET1 ratio. Our requirements currently at 10.4% and so we got plenty of capital, and it's built up. So I think from a global competitive standpoint, we've got to be careful here, because the U.S. industry is the best industry in the world and actually does a lot of good for all the countries, including the U.S. and, and frankly the rules applied tend to be more favorable to those outside our country. As we got to be careful to maintain a competitive parity, but in the end of the day, Gerard, you need to finish this and get this behind us and the industry will adopt and move forward and, but they've got to think through the downside of some of these rules and that they could push up outside the industry to non-banks that have the asset classes across the board and non-banks, including mortgage-lending which you referenced, half of it goes through non-banks. And those the resilience those institutions, it's interesting to watch recycles. And then the second thing have to worry about competitiveness overall. But and then also just slowing down economy, 10% increase in our capital levels, would this enable us for making about $150 billion of loans at the margin, and you want our banks to support the economy like we do. So I think all this has to be balanced out as they go to adopt these rules. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And then as a follow-up, Alastair, you talked about the balance sheet. I think you said 100 basis point increase, it wouldn't lead to over $3 billion in net interest revenue growth over the next 12 months. And 100 basis point decrease would lead to a decline of just over $3 billion in revenue. Can you share with us, when do you think you might change or what would make you change that position to be liability sensitive, would you rely on the forward curve. What's the outlook for the balance sheet management, that you're looking at now. Alastair Borthwick : Well, Gerard, I don't think much has changed for us. We've talked about the fact that for us, it's this idea of balance that's key. And if you look at our disclosures around interest-rate risk over the course of the past couple of years, you'll see it's more balanced both upside and downside and it's a narrower corridor over time. So we're trying to sustain NII at a higher level for longer, that's what we're trying to engineer. So, I think going-forward, there won't be a lot of change to our philosophy in that regard. We feel like we're in a pretty good position in terms of balance, will be tweaking at the margin. But what will largely drive things from here is just normalization of deposits and good old fashioned loan growth. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Your line is open. Brian Moynihan : Good morning, Glenn. Glenn Schorr : Good morning. So, no one to take issue with 600 basis points of operating leverage. But I just always like doing a little gut check. Expenses are up 5%. I heard all the reasons why a lot of investment, FDIC charges coming, but I just wanted to make sure did anything change over the last like decade or so, you've been basically flat for life? Is expenses more of a relative game throughout the revenues or do you think you can keep expenses in and around the same area as we continue to invest. Thanks. Brian Moynihan : Yes. So, Glenn, I think Alastair gave you a trajectory which if you look at it from fourth quarter last year to the fourth quarter this year, it gets you relatively flat year-over-year, and as your revenues flatten out because interest-rate movements flatten out, you'll see that as we decline in the quarters, that'll be strong. So, as we think about it - as we think about the forward, we think about the ability to control headcount and have expenses continue to come down, but they're going to stay at a level that's relatively consistent where we are now over time, and the goal is then to grow revenue faster than expense. We've been doing it for many decades, you can see that in our data. And - but the way we do it differs from five years ago to 10 years ago to last year, and that the ability to move the branch configuration around when we had 6,000 branches down to 4,000, or 3,900, 3,800, now it is different from 3,800 to where it might end up. And so, you should expect us to continue to engineer by applying massive amounts of technology. Erica saves a lot of transactional activity, Zelle saves a lot of transactional activity deposits by mobile phone saves a lot of activity. All that goes on, and then what we're offsetting with that is from the decade you talk about we probably went from $2.5 billion of technology initiatives a year to $3.8 billion, and we went - we have a lot more revenue that is compensated for, thinking about in the wealth management business, and those are things we fight all the time. So, we expect to manage expenses in-line with revenue. As we got to '19, we told you that we're going to have to start growing expenses at a modest growth rate relative to the revenue growth rate will outgrow the economy on revenue expense and grow a couple 100 basis points lower, it kind of going to be back in that mode frankly, it just with inflation they kicked up and now we have flattened them back out, and then we'll get back in sync as we move to '24 and beyond. Alastair Borthwick : Glenn, look, the only thing I would just add to what Brian just said. We put up 16.2 in the first quarter, we were 16-ish this quarter obviously. We kind of feel like next quarter just with all the work that we've done around headcount and getting the firm in the place that we want now, we feel like we are well positioned to deliver 15.8 this quarter. If and when we keep going, we think we're going to be somewhere around 15.6 or so in Q4. So, to Brian's point, number one, we like the trajectory now. We've shaped the headcount over time to get to the place where we want to be. And that would compare, I think Q4 last year was 15.5, so when you talk about that sort of flattish idea in an inflationary environment, we feel like that's a pretty good way to end this year and a pretty good way to set up for next year. Glenn Schorr : Totally agree. Thanks for all that. I appreciate it. Operator : We'll take our next question from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Brian Moynihan : Good morning, Mike. Mike Mayo : Hi, good morning. So, I don't think consensus has you, with a [positive outcome] over the third and fourth quarter, and I just want to make sure I heard you correctly, Brian, in your opening remark, is you expect that eight quarter of consecutive positive operating leverage to continue, so you expect nine quarters or ten quarters or as long as you can, and, you know, the one reason is you'll see NII headwinds, you said it should be kind of flattish in the third quarter and then down some in the fourth quarter, and you said the commercial loan demand is a little bit less and utilization is less. And you did just give some specific expense numbers and maybe I guess the specific question is how long these sectors [indiscernible] quarter slides are we done with that expect that to go. And then, to what degree to your digital efforts your first three slides, Slide 4, 5 and 6 play a part in sustaining this positive operating leverage, say through 2024 and 2025. Is that a goal or is that an expectation. Brian Moynihan : So our goal is always to maintain it. And Mike, you point out that the toughest times when you have sort of a twist in the interest-rate environment and you can see that at the end of '19 and we got right back into it right after the environment stabilize, but just thinking about the question you asked me a few years ago Mike was - when NII is coming in are going to let it fall the bottom-line, you going to spend it at about 80% plus of it is falling to the bottom-line, which shows you how we position the franchise from the second quarter of '21 until now as we went through the interest-rate - the fast interest-rate raising. So we gave you the specific as you said, the specific expense guidance by quarter. We'd expect that should produce operating leverage that will be it gets tougher and then it will get easier as we start to see the stabilization of deposits and loans and loan growth, you sort of routinely come through in the economy frankly, shaking through whether we're going to have a recession or not. And so we feel good about what we've done, that's why I tried to give that longer period of time that people have the context, it's very different environments how you've achieved at sometimes revenue fell and expense fell faster, sometimes revenue grew and expense grew, but slower and all the different ways. So we'll keep working at it in a key leading indicator we like as we've been able to manage the headcount down as Alastair said earlier and frankly that is in the face of a turnover rate year-over-year which has dropped in half, which is good because we're not training and hiring as many people, and that then sets us up for the second half of the year because that headcount benefit us not really come through the P&L and will offset some of the other inflation. Mike Mayo : And then as it relates to NII, specifically. You said that the last few months, you're a little bit more confident given stabilization in pricing. I guess we're not seeing that every banks, right. Some banks getting worse, some banks getting better. So what does that gives you more confidence on the NII front, and the deposit stabilization front. Brian Moynihan : Well, I can't look, I can't speak to other banks Mike. But obviously we know we are in a privileged in advantage position relative to our client base. I just think it's interesting, you look at our global banking set of results over the course of the past year and a half in particular that's extraordinary resilience. And look, Q2 is tax season, so if you look at the wealth management business for example, deposits were down $9 billion, but we know that paid tax payments of $14 billion, $15 billion, $16 billion last quarter. So there is beginning to be a little more stability and obviously, our focus has always been on transactional primary operating, and we may be seeing the benefit of that in some degree, but will continue -- we show you on slide, I think it was Page 12 of the earnings deck, that's where it is. We showed that last quarter we showed again next quarter. But it's just the Fed's engineering this across-the-board, and we're just reacting to what we see from our customer-base. Mike Mayo : Okay, thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global. Your line is open. Jim Mitchell : Hi, good morning. Maybe just a follow-up on deposit behavior. I appreciate the comment that you have very low loan-to-deposit ratio have to chase rate. So it feels like datas can stay low, but how do you think about how are you thinking about the mix going forward. We are seeing NIB's has come down, CD demand is picking-up. How are you thinking of - what are you seeing in your deposit base with respect to mix. Brian Moynihan : I think Jim, one of the things that as we think about deposits, we think about across each of the customer bases and that's what Page 12 shows you. We think about what do they have cashless for that, cash transact and to have cash-in-excess of that. And what happens is, depending on the customer segment that cash moves to the market that excess cash moves the market. But the transactional cash is all with us, that transactional cash far exceeds for us our loan balances. So we have excess transactional cash, in a lot of it is low-interest checking, no interest checking, even if it's a money markets that sort of cushion that you have consumers as a wealthy people, while the consumers and an average consumers maintain to pay their bills and unexpected expenses. So that's what you've seen in that producers, the cost to deposits of $1.24, which is far different than we see other people have and that that's just happens. In other questions how much moves and as Alastair said earlier, we're after tax time now where we have a big wealth management pay-out to the - to tap into the taxes. We also passed the point where people have way passed the point last payments where people will have to that money has been and accounts and still is in their accounts to a large degree as we look at them and they're paying that down slowly. So the average balance in our checking accounts has gone from a high of 11,000, the peak the 10,600 and 10,500 something like that. So all that dynamic, but you got to go back and say, it's the mix of interest-bearing and non-interest bearing is actually a little bit of a misnomer because it's really what the customer uses it the cash for, and they use it to transact and run their household. That's a very stable base and that's what this data shows across time and it's fundamentally a lot higher than pre-pandemic, so consumer $700 billion pre-pandemic $1 trillion now. Checking that if you look on the pages in the deposit descriptions, you'll see those numbers are Page 13, I think it is, those numbers will show you how much is stayed in checking, that's because we have more customers, but more importantly, the average consumer through inflation stuff has more money around. And that provides great crisp for the mill. Jim Mitchell : Right. So do you feel like that mix-shift is starting to slow and stabilize. Brian Moynihan : Well, that's what the data on Page 12 shows you. That's why we show you this level of detail in our customer bases, our lines of business that many don't show you did demonstrate that differences there for us. And other people maybe there too, I just can't find it in their data. But if you look at that's why we show you page, while we see actually see during the second quarter, you the week-by-week average balance movement and it's as Alastair said earlier that it's very stable in GWIM, it's very stable global banking even in non-interest-bearing piece half of that is excess balance, half of it is earnings credit rates through the GTS process and then you got to be careful that. And you look at the consumer and it's bouncing around the high $980 trillion, depending on the thing and ended at a trillion. And that happens when payroll has happened all stuff. But that's hugely, hugely advantaged pricing, 20 odd basis points in total for the consumer goods. And you asked about CD's, we only have $40 billion of CD's. So we are what our customers are asking for CD rates, we give them to it's just not the core business and then we have the investment side, we push those wealth management flows and the consumer investment flows are part of our deposits moving over to the market when this excess cash. Jim Mitchell : All right, very helpful. Thanks a lot. Operator : We'll go next to Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Christopher Kotowski : Yes, good morning and thanks for taking the question. In the press release from last week settlement with BofA, CFPB Director, Chopra alleged that you among other things opened customer accounts without consent. And I'm just wondering how is such a thing possible and the post Wells Fargo era. And can you compare and contrast, what happened at your firm with what happened at Wells? Brian Moynihan : Frankly, Chris, it's - when we went all through the horizontal review by the OCC and all the practices and everything were changed then. And these - the small number of accounts that are part of this are from that time period. It's just - not the other agencies did anything, and then the consumer bureau had to - sitting around, we kind of cleaned it up this quarter. So that was that one. Christopher Kotowski : The time period that reflects which time period? Brian Moynihan : It reflects up to the current time, but the accounts were from '16 and before '17. Back when -- remember, the Comptroller Curry did the 3-phase review of all the other firms that they didn't find - you can go look at the data and then hopefully, the next Comptroller will testify in Congress and started in the Obama administration after Wells and then led in the early part of the Trump administration with [indiscernible]. And you can go look at that, that was cleared up, but we've made the changes in those processes at that time. Christopher Kotowski : Okay. Thank you. That's it from me. Operator : We'll go next to Erika Najarian with UBS. Your line is open. Brian Moynihan : Hi Erica, you might be on mute. Catherine, maybe we can come back to Erica. Operator : Absolutely. We'll go next to Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good morning. Brian Moynihan : Good morning, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : A couple of questions. One on the operating leverage that I know you discussed earlier. I mean, in the past, when you had the record number of consecutive quarters of positive operating leverage, it seemed like it was being driven primarily [technical difficulty] a lot of inputs, but 1 of the big drivers was consolidation of branches. And now it's an investment spend environment in branches. So I'm just wondering if there is - if you would agree with that. And if there's a different way that you're going to be delivering this positive operating leverage as you're increasing investment spend in one of the core platforms of the company. Brian Moynihan : Betsy, that's kind of what I said earlier. It's been gotten by different ways in different periods of time. But even in the last year, the numbers of branches, I think dropped about from 3,900 to 3,800 and change. And so even as we deployed new ones. And so you're consolidating branches in markets you've been in a long time with lots of branches. The ATM count continues to drift down. But importantly, if you go to the digital pages and look at the activity levels by customers - and you're speaking mostly the consumer business, but affects all customer bases. And you see things like Zelle transactions far exceeding checks. Remember that - what that means is that we don't have to process a check on the back end of that. And so, and then your process it, push it through. So all that continues to grow very quickly and continues to change the overall operating costs in our consumer business. Our cost of operating plus the cost of pays and deposits is still 130-odd basis points or whatever, it's very strong. If you go where the big moves are coming as what we're doing in the markets business, for example, in terms of deeper, deeper digitization, it was always - equity trading was already digitized, but the operational process behind that the throughput of the amount of stuff that's going straight through. And then what's behind that also on the wealth management to customers getting their statements and statements not being delivered to customers' home, but delivered that kind is of $0.5 billion annual benefit that's accumulated over time. And so if there were some magic thing you could pull, you'd pull it, but these are a whole bunch of operational excellence ideas, it seems [indiscernible] to the general public, but it just is a constant improvement of the platform, allows us to constantly manage people down as a percentage of work done by people always comes down. And then now with artificial intelligence and all enthusiasm, we decided that's in the future, the way we've applied it so far has enabled us to do things like our business bankers are more efficient at culling because we use artificial intelligence and programs to tell them which prospects they go to, not to tell - they know their clients and they run it, but which prospects they should approach first so they're more efficient or the adviser match, which has an intelligence base built into it to match a client to an adviser that's - you saw the statistics about the number of leads, 20,000 leads. All this is adding efficiency. So yes, the brand system has got - it's come down a slope and that slope is starting to flatten out. But in that slope is a massive reinvestment in rehabs and a massive opening. And then more and more deposits over top of that, which keeps that efficiency going. Betsy Graseck : So your point on enthusiasm for AI but in your comments, it sounds like there's more legs to that that you're anticipating going forward as well? Is that fair? Brian Moynihan : Yes. Erica, we started working on probably eight years ago now. They do a natural language processing capability that could answer questions that we can make sure the answer was what we wanted to be and every - and on our proprietary systems. And so it's an algorithm that anticipates the answer to a question, but it comes from our data and it looks in your account. But those 165 million interactions in the last quarter, all of them would have been an e-mail, a text, a phone call, and they were all done through the customer entering it into Erica and getting an answer, and then going on and it started. But that will just keep expanding to become a higher and higher functionality. It is a - start at a methodology, which these new programs are far in excess of that, but they're not tested on data, they hallucinate and all these wonderful things that you hear the experts talk about that have to be carefully controlled before you apply. But Erica is using some of the same principles but applied in a very controlled environment. And by the way, when we do it with our drafting the [indiscernible] credit offer memoranda or we do it with a business - targeting that we talked about. All those are ways that we apply, but it's a very controlled setting. So it still has a lot more out there, frankly, as it gets understood better and how it works better and how it can be - attribution, accountability, those types of things have to build in. But Erica, that was built in from the start. Betsy Graseck : Okay. Thanks. And then just one follow-up on the capital question. I know that you are reviewing the SCB with the Fed, but I'm just trying to understand what kind of expectations you have for buybacks as we look forward here, realizing that there's some puts and takes with Basel 3, but there's some benefits here with the SCB. Thanks. Alastair Borthwick : Yes. So we got the final stress capital buffer along with the rest of the industry in August. So we'll wait for that, obviously. And then, Betsy, I think we'll likely have to wait for Basel 3 final clarity. That's still moving, and so we don't have the proposed rule yet. Then we have to wait for the comment period, then we got to wait for the final rule. So there's a lot that needs to go on before we get full perspective. But I think Brian said it well. I mean we've got plenty of capital. We've been buying back enough shares to offset the share dilution. And we've got flexibility to do a little bit more. So the other thing that you see over the course of the past year is obviously stress capital buffer last year, we had to add 90 basis points. Well, we've added 110 over the course of the past year, and capped return on tangible common equity around 15% while buying back shares. So we've got the flexibility to do a little bit of everything. But I think we want to see what the final rules look like before we make too many decisions. Betsy Graseck : Yes. All right. Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Your line is open. Kenneth Usdin : Hi, good morning. Just one question on credit to follow up your comments. So it looks like the card normalization is progressing very gradually, 90-day past dues, but only kind of marginally. Just give your points about the consumer having still plenty of cash, the economy holding up well. Just your view on just ongoing normalization of card losses specifically, and just anything else that we should be mindful of when we think about credit normalization. Thank you. Alastair Borthwick : Dan, I think you nailed it. That's sort of been - you just - you watch our - if you look at our charge-offs, for example, that's mainly about loan growth and a little bit about the rate picking up just a little bit, but it's still well below pandemic. You can see that. And fourth quarter '19 was a great quarter for asset quality and cards. So it gets back to this idea that the consumer is still in a pretty healthy place. You can see that in the unemployment statistics, and you can see it in the way that they're just continuing to spend a little bit more money year-over-year. So I feel like the - we've been pretty consistent. The consumer is pretty resilient. That remains the case, and we're benefiting it from right now in the card experience. Kenneth Usdin : Thanks. And sorry, just one more follow-up on the fee side. Can you help us understand - the card, the deposit service charges, asset management kind of all been stable to slightly lower. Have the effects that you put through in terms of all the service charges - changes and new rewards card benefits and all that, are we close to getting that run rate? Any signals of stability in some of those areas? Brian Moynihan : So as Alastair mentioned earlier, there's been a 10-year change in how we work in the overdraft area. And the biggest - and another set of changes were made and fully implemented in the third quarter of last year. So they're in the current run rate. It's just the year-over-year comparisons, this quarter picks up a little bit of pre - final changes to post. So if you look at the FDIC data, I think we're down to $30-odd million a quarter or something like that. And overdraft fees compared to others that are multiples of that. But we've -- it's all through the system. It's all done and all the changes required under the recent announcements and stuff that have been made for a couple of years. So it's in the run rate, so to speak. Kenneth Usdin : All right. Thanks a lot. Got it. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll go next to Charles Peabody with Portales. Your line is open. Charles Peabody : Good morning. Just a question about your interest-bearing deposits with the Fed, and I'm looking at Page 8, your average balance sheet. And those balances were up quite considerably quarter-over-quarter. And yet your deposit base was relatively flat. So I was just curious, what the thinking behind that was. Was it a desire to build liquidity? Was there an arbitrage opportunity for NII? What was - why build the balances so aggressively? Alastair Borthwick : Yes. So if you go back to - we talked about this at the end of last quarter, Charles. At the end of last quarter, it was an interesting time for the industry. And we felt like it was prudent to just build cash during a period like that. And so that's what we did. And it's - it was obviously, an extraordinary period. Since then as the environment is normalizing, I'd anticipate and I talked about that earlier, you'll see our cash levels just continue to come back down. And so that's all that's happening. It's a choice on our part to position with cash, and you'll begin to see that drift lower now. Charles Peabody : Okay. And as a follow-up then, would that imply that the average balance sheet or more importantly, RWAs will start to shrink and that would help your capital? I'm just trying to understand the capital... Alastair Borthwick : No, it shouldn't really impact RWAs because most of that is sort of low or zero RWA. What it should impact is, if you look at our net interest yield, that's always a question of numerator and denominator. And when we increased the cash balances, that inflates the denominator for a period of time. So that doesn't hurt NII, but it does inflate your balance sheet just a little bit. So I think as you look forward, what you should expect is we just get back to work on both parts of that numerator and denominator will grind away at the NII side. And then on the denominator side, we'll have a smaller, more efficient balance sheet as the environment normalizes. And in the meantime, it hasn't hurt NII in any way. Charles Peabody : Thank you. Operator : We'll go to Erika Najarian with UBS. Your line is open. Erika Najarian : Hi, good morning. I'm sorry I missed the earlier call. On the net interest income trajectory, Alastair, clearly a big focus for your shareholders. You mentioned when you were responding to Gerard's first question that you narrowed the volatility of net interest income. And I think that investors I'm sure are going to start asking you guys and us about the starting point of $14 billion for NII next year. I guess we're wondering, if the Fed stays higher for longer, doesn't move, how does that impact that $14 billion run rate? Does that $14 billion capture a cumulative deposit beta that would sort of fully reflect what you would expect to experience through the cycle? And then I have a follow-up question from there. Alastair Borthwick : So all of our asset disclosures reflect the betas that we believe at the time. So that part is always in the disclosures. It's too early for me to say on 2024. We're giving guidance for the rest of the year, so you have a pretty good sense of what we're pretty confident around. But last time I looked at the forward curve, we had one, possibly two hikes this year and then as many as five declines next year. So there's a lot between here and there. And I think we'll just assume to take the next three to six months to figure out, Erika, exactly how we feel about '24. Erika Najarian : Totally understand. So going back to the down 100 basis point disclosure that would yield to down $3 billion for full year basis. How much of that - given that you have exposure to the shape of the curve, not just the short end of the curve because of your securities book, how much of that is short rates versus long rates in terms of that drop? I guess what I'm trying to figure out is, if I simply divide $3 billion by 4, right, that would get me a run rate of $13.25 billion on a quarterly basis. And you mentioned that there are about five cuts in next year. But if it's not on the short end, right? And if it's half-half, then it could get to a run rate of $13.75 billion. So just - I know there's a lot in there. So I would just love your thoughts on everything I just said. Alastair Borthwick : Well, you lost me a little. But I'll say this. We've got - it's actually done $3.6 billion. It's not done $3 billion. So that's number one. Number two, you should think about the short term being the vast majority of that. And number three, part of the reason that I think we feel like we've narrowed this corridor, and we've got a little more stability around it is, A, the securities book. And B, just as importantly, there's been a large rotation into interest-bearing. And so as rates in a disclosure like this, as rates come down, one would expect that we'll be somewhat insulated from that in a different way than we might have two years ago when we didn't have as much interest-bearing. Erika Najarian : Understand. Thank you. Operator : We'll take a follow-up from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Mike Mayo : Hi, I just keep staring at Slides 4, 5 and 6 for the digital progress that you're making and trying to connect that to your expenses and operating leverage. And I guess where I get to is certainly, you're signaling that trend should be good for revenue versus expense or at least you're trying to have that. But I still look at the efficiency ratio of expenses to revenues of 64% or 62%, and then you compare that to the levels from 2018 and 2019 when it was 57% and 58%. So I guess the question is, you've got all these digital initiatives and progress - and again, I appreciate the disclosure on these slides but it would be great to have more of your peers disclose that, all that progress. Why can't you get back to levels from '18 to '19 or at least below 60%? And if so, how long would it take? Brian Moynihan : Mike, the linkage of the digital activity to produce the many quarters of operating leverage at the last 8.5 years, et cetera, is an absolute tie in, and Betsy asked about the branch count and all the things that we've done. The efficiency ratio for us is as a plain element, which is the wealth management business is a big part of our revenue base and has a different operating dynamic because of how it's reported. As you well know, that the revenue has the cost of compensation as a percent of revenue is high. And we basically make 50 cents on the dollar for every dollar past the revenue takeout, which - the adviser compensation level. And we're continuing to try to improve that and make the adviser more efficient and things like that, but that's a major change. We improved year-over-year. And frankly, we're still cleaning out some pandemic-related costs and things like that. So we'll continue to drive that down. And as net interest income has come up and more important part of the business that helps push that efficiency ratio back down. And that's the goal. I mean, you're describing what we go to work and do every day. And the way we do it is - the application of technology across the board. And then removing work in the system and bringing that out and bringing it to the bottom line and then making the investments we did to make it happen again. So we'll continue to do that. But the efficiency ratio, remember, for us, if you go lines of business is best-in-class. It's just we have a bigger mix towards the wealth management business than most other people. Mike Mayo : And let me just try one more time. On Erica, if it could be Bank of America AI, maybe you spin out your Erica business, but you guys highlight a number of hours in takes in manual labor. And do you have a connection of that to what that saves in expenses or what that could save or should save over the next few years? Brian Moynihan : Yes. It will continue to allow us to do more with the same amount. So if you think about from '19 to now, Mike, remember, the number of customers who do their core checking list is up 10%. So it's not a - and that is a lot of people. It's 3 million more customers doing 20, 30 transactions a month, and all that's going through on a relatively flat expense base. And we've been - we've had - with inflation and wages and things, we've absorbed all that as part of the thing, and that's why the costs have changed. But the reality is we flatten that back out, and then we'll keep driving it back down. And that - if you look at the cost of deposits, which is the cost of running all that as a percentage of deposits, you can see that on the consumer page, it still maintains a nice break against the rate they would receive for the deposit balances. So we're working at it. Simply put, we had 100,000 people in the consumer business a decade-plus ago. We now have 16 going - and it comes down a little bit every quarter. Even though we're putting new branches with an average of 5 to 10 people and depending on the location and things like that going on. And so that just keeps going in the right direction. Now if you take that across other things, in our operations group, the team there continues to have flat headcount, down headcount, and we invest that back in the technology side for more developers, 20-odd thousand on our payroll plus another 10,000 or 15,000 of third parties that go through, frankly, the top lines. And so we keep trying to drive it in to make us more efficient. So all the principles you're saying is right, and we expect it to continue to have a benefit. Mike Mayo : All right. Thank you. Operator : There are no further questions in queue at this time. I'd like to turn the program back over to Brian Moynihan for any additional or closing remarks. Brian Moynihan : Thank you for joining us all. As you think about the quarter, strong profitability, strong 15% return on tangible common equity or better. Continued to drive organic growth, continued to drive our operating leverage. And if we gave you clarity on the future path of expenses and NII, but above all else in the quarter where we've had a strong capital markets performance and a strong investment banking performance, I think, along with our other usual great performance of business, and we feel good about the company and its position going forward. Thank you. Operator : This does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.",

Later, you will have the opportunity to ask questions during a question-and-answer session. Please note today's call will be recorded and we will be standing by if you should need any assistance. It is now my pleasure to turn today's conference over to Lee McEntire, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Lee McEntire : Good morning. Thank you. Welcome and thank you for joining the call to review the third quarter results. As usual, our earnings release documents are available on the Investor Relations section of the bankofamerica.com website, and it includes the earnings presentation that we will be referring to during the call. I trust everybody's had a chance to review the documents. I'm going to first turn the call over to our CEO, Brian Moynihan, for some opening comments before, Alastair Borthwick, our CFO, discusses the details of the quarter. Before we do that, let me just remind you that we may make forward-looking statements and refer to some non-GAAP financial measures during the call. Forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause our actual results to materially differ from expectations are detailed in our earnings materials as well as the SEC filings available on our website. Information about non-GAAP financial measures, including reconciliations to US GAAP, can also be found in our earnings materials that are on the website. So with that, Brian, I'll turn the call over to you. Brian Moynihan : Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. As usual, we're starting on Slide 2. Our third quarter here at Bank of America was another strong quarter as we delivered $7.8 billion in net income. That is a 10% growth over the year-ago third quarter. And for the first nine months of the year, we have earned $23.4 billion, an increase of 15% over 2022. We grew clients and accounts organically and at a strong pace across all our businesses. Our operating leverage was about flat. We improved our common equity Tier 1 ratio by nearly 30 basis points in the quarter to a level of 11.9% against a current minimum of 9.5%. We saw an increase in our deposits and we maintained our strong pricing discipline. We continue to maintain $859 billion in global liquidity sources. We also deliver a good return for you, our shareholders, with a return on tangible common equity of over 15% and a 1% return on assets. Just a quick note of what we see in the economy. Our team of economists predicts a soft landing with a trough in the middle of next year. We see that in our customer data, our 37 million checking customers, we see their spending slowing down. You can see that on Slide 34. The third quarter was up about 4% over last year's third quarter. Earlier this year, that would have been more of a 10% increase year-over-year. And for the entire year of 2022, it increased 10% [round numbers over \u201821] (ph). This 4% level is consistent with the spending we saw in the pre-pandemic period from 2016 to 2019. That is consistent with a low-inflation, lower-growth economy. As we move into October, the spending is holding at that 4% level. So growing, but growing at a basis more consistent with low growth, low inflation economy. With that, let me turn to Slide 3. We provide various highlights, and Al's just going to cover a lot of this. Our team continues to focus on driving organic growth, driving digital progress, and operational excellence, which keeps us focused on operating leverage. A few words on organic growth as we flip to Slide 4. Every business segment had organic growth. In Consumer, in quarter three, we opened more than 200,000 net new checking accounts this quarter alone. We also opened another 1 million credit card accounts. We have 10% more investment accounts this year, third quarter, than we did last year. In Small Business, we have seen 35 straight quarters of net new checking account growth. We've also seen good small business loan growth, and our loans are up 14% from last year. That was -- in this quarter, our Small Business teammates extended $2.8 billion in credit to small business in America alone. In Global Wealth, we added nearly 7,000 net new relationships to the Merrill and Private Bank franchises. And our advisors opened more than 35,000 new bank accounts for the third consecutive quarter, fulfilling both investing and banking needs for those clients. We also increased our number of advisors. In the past year, across our wealth spectrum, in GWIM and in consumer investments, they have combined to gather $87 billion in total net flows. In our Global Banking team, we added clients and increased the number of products per relationship. Year-to-date, we've added 1,900 new commercial and business banking clients. That is more than we added in the full year last year. Even while activity is low, the investment banking team continues to hold us number three position. In the Global Markets, we continue to see performance establish new records for our firm. I'm going to cover that in a little more detail in a moment. As you can move to Slide 5, you can see the digital adoption engagement and volumes continue to increase. We lead the industry in digital banking and continue to provide the best-in-class disclosures. You can find those disclosures by line of business in the appendix on slides 26, 29, and 31. We also continue to receive top accolades from third parties around these capabilities. Most important, these capabilities are valued by our clients and customers and allow us to grow with great expense leverage. Let me give you a few examples. Our Consumer and Merrill clients logged into our consumer banking app a record 3.2 billion times this quarter. Even at this scale and stage of maturity of this operation, logins are up double digits from the year prior. Customer use of Erica continued to beat our expectations with almost 19 million users, up 16% in the past 12 months. CashPro App sign-ins with our business clients are up more than 40%. And we recently added the Erica functionality to CashPro to help corporate clients benefit from that artificial intelligence. Likewise, Zelle users continues to grow. Zelle transaction levels are up more than 25% from last year. And Zelle is becoming a meaningful way our customers move money. In fact, customers now send money with Zelle at twice the rate they write checks. We're nearing a period where the Zelle transactions sent will exceed the combination of checks written and ATM withdrawal transactions. As you move across the lines of business on the slide, the story is the same. All these capabilities help us deliver faster, safer, and more efficiently. And all of it gets strong customer and client feedback. When you put that together, that helps us drive operating leverage, and you can see it on Slide 6. We have a strong record of driving operating leverage in our company. We drove operating leverage every quarter for nearly five years before the pandemic. And then again, more recently, we've had an eight-quarter streak leading to this quarter. We acknowledged to you this last quarter that our operating leverage is going to be tough for a few quarters as we navigate through the trough of net interest income. But as you can see on Slide 6, we managed to grow revenue year-over-year faster than expense in dollar terms this quarter, even though the percentage change was basically flat. Now, in January, we told you we'd manage our head countdown to help make sure we got our expenses in line. Over the course of 2023 we've seen moving from 2022's great resignation to our current level of a record low attrition in our company. All that meant the team had to work harder to manage that headcount down. And they did it. Our headcount is now down over 7,000 FTEs [from a] (ph) peak in January, even with the addition of 2,500 college grads this fall. As a result, you've seen expense decline from $16.2 billion in quarter one to $16 billion in quarter two to $15.8 billion this quarter. By the way, we've done this without special charges or large layoffs. Expense will decline again in the fourth quarter, excluding any FDIC special assessment, of course. We expect to report $15.6 billion in expenses in 4Q. Now interestingly, the debt is up only around 1% from fourth quarter of last year. This is stronger expense guidance than we thought we could do earlier in the year and sets us up nicely for next year. Shifting gears, let's focus on the balance sheet. Slide 7 shows the breakout of deposit trends on a weekly basis -- ending basis across the third quarter. We gave you this chart last quarter also. In the upper left-hand, you can see the trend of total deposits. We ended quarter three at $1.88 trillion, up from quarter two and better than industry results. What you should also note is the cost of these deposits. Our team has rewarded customers with higher rates for their investment [or in cash] (ph), re-initiated deposit growth and grown share with always superior mix in cost. You will note we're now paying 155 basis points all in for deposits, which is up 31 basis points from last quarter. I ask that you remember two things when you think about the deposits. The rate remains low relative to many because of the transactional nature of deposit relationships with $565 billion in non-interest-bearing deposits. And you can see in the upper right alone, in low interest and no interest checking, there's $504 billion in Consumer. Secondly, remember the importance of the spread against the quarter's average Fed funds rate. This position is very advantageous compared to past cycles because the transactional counts in the current cycle are a much higher mix of Bank of America's deposits. I would also add that while we maintain discipline in deposit price and we pay competitive rates to customers with excess cash seeing higher yields across all the businesses, if rates fall, those particular products will see the rates come down also. Dropping into the business trends. In Consumer, if you look at the top right chart, you saw a $22 billion decline. Note, the difference in the movement through the quarter between the balance of low to no-interest checking accounts and higher-yielding non-checking accounts. You could also see the low levels of our more rate-sensitive balance in consumer investments and CD balances broken out. In total, we have $982 billion in consumer deposits. In Consumer alone, this is $250 billion more than we had pre-pandemic. The total rate paid on consumer deposits in the quarter was 34 basis points. This remains very low, driven by the high percentage of transactional -- high-quality transaction accounts. Most of the quarter's rate increase is concentrated in CDs and consumer investment deposits where about -- which are about 13% of the deposits. Turning to Wealth Management, balances were flat. We saw a slowing in the previous quarterly trend of clients moving money from lower-yielding sweep accounts into higher-yielding preferred deposits and off-balance sheet products ones. Sweep balances were down by $7 billion and were replaced by new account generation and deepening. At the bottom right, note the Global Banking deposits grew $2 billion and have hovered around $500 million for the past six quarters. These are generally the transaction deposits of our commercial customers used to manage their cash flows. Noninterest-bearing deposits were 37% of deposits at the end of the quarter. Sticking with the balance sheet but moving to capital, let me give you a few thoughts on the proposed capital rules. As you are well aware, our banking industry in the United States is the most highly capitalized the most profitable banking group in the world. It's a source of strength for our country and its economy. The annual stress tests over -- are now over a dozen years old, using ever-increasing harsher test scenarios have proven that capital is sufficient. Banks have proven to be a part of the solution during the more recent COVID pandemic and the banking disruption in March this year. We add to our capital and reduce our lending capacity to American business consumers, and those trade-offs are being debated. But as far as the rules are concerned, there are many parts of the rules that our industry doesn't agree with because of double accounts or increased trading and market risk. And we're talking to those proposals and working, and we're hopeful they'll change. But in any event, they may not. If they don't, how will they affect us? If you go to Slide 8, you can show the expected impact as we interpret those proposed rules. This assumes that they're proposed today without any changes. The proposed rules would inflate our risk-weighted assets by about 20%. So if I apply the inflation against this quarter's RWA of $1.63 trillion, that means, if nothing else changed in the rules, we'd end up with about $320 billion more risk-weighted assets. The biggest increase in RWA would be a couple hundred billion dollars in operational RWA. The next biggest category would be driven by a four-fold increase in the RWA against non-publicly traded equity exposures. In our case, that really is mostly about the tax-advantaged investments in solar and wind. Looking at the capital to be held against the inflated RWA on the right side of the slide, I'd remind you today that our minimum capital requirement is to hold 9.5% in on Common Equity Tier 1. But based on our G-SIB charges, that going to come in effect on January 1, 2024, we moved to 10%. So I'm going to use that as a requirement. Holding 10% today means $163 billion, that we finished the third quarter with $194 billion. So today, we have more than $30 billion excess capital. Now, let's assume the proposed change is going through in full. The proposed changes are phased in from '25 -- the middle '25 to '28 under the current proposal. When those are fully phased in, as we used to call Basel fully phased in, if you remember, we would have a need for $195 billion of total capital. Now if you look on the upper right-hand side of the page, you'll see that we're today, we're at $194 billion. So we hold the required capital today. And of course, we'd have to build a buffer to that throughout the implementation period. But if you look at the bottom of the page, you see just in the last nine quarters the kind of capital generation this company has. Once we understand the rules, we'll of course have a bit -- a chance to optimize our balance sheet and appropriately price assets to improve the return on tangible common equity. Now, before I turn it over to Alastair, I just wanted to highlight one of the businesses that we talked about over the many years. That's our Global Markets business. Global Markets represent 17% of the company's year-to-date earnings and it's one of the top capital markets platforms in world. It's one 'of a handful of firms that can do what is due, providing advice and execution in every major market around the world. Jimmy DeMare and the team who run the business asked us for additional investment around four years ago, and they've grown this business with an intensity that clients are appreciative and reward us with more of their business. This has produced strong revenue growth. We've grown the balance sheet here but have done it efficiently. That's allowed us to grow sales and trading revenue over the past 12 months consistently, and now stands 32% higher than the average of the five years leading into the pandemic in the investment in the business. And through effective cost management, we also generated 11% to 12% returns on capital in this business. This exceeds our cost of capital even as we continue to allocate more capital to the business. Returns are even larger if you combine it with the Global Banking business, that many show the businesses combined and take -- because our corporate clients also take advantage of these industry-leading capabilities. With that, let me turn over the call to Alastair to walk through the quarter. Alastair? Alastair Borthwick : Thanks, Brian. And on Slide 10, we present the summary income statement. I'm not going to spend a lot of time here because Brian touched on this and the highlights that we show on Slide 3. For the quarter, we generated $7.8 billion in net income, resulting in $0.90 per diluted share. Both of those are up the double digits from the third quarter of last year. The year-over-year revenue growth of 3% was led by improvement in net interest income, coupled with a strong 8% increase in sales and trading results, and that excludes DVA, and a 4% increase in investment in brokerage revenue driven by our Wealth Management businesses. Expense for the quarter of $15.8 billion included good discipline from our team, which allowed us to reduce costs from the second quarter, even as we continue our planned investments for marketing, technology and physical presence build-outs, including financial center openings and renovations. Asset quality remains stellar, and provision expense for the quarter was $1.2 billion. That consisted of $931 million of net charge-offs and $303 million of reserve build. The provision expense reflects the continued trend in charge-offs toward pre-pandemic levels and remains below historical levels. Our charge-off rate was 35 basis points, that's 2 basis points higher than the second quarter, and still below the 39 basis points we saw in the fourth quarter of '19. And as a reminder, that 2019 was a multi-decade low. 30-day delinquencies also remained below their fourth quarter '19 level. Lastly, our tax rate this quarter was 4%, driven mostly by higher-than-expected volume of investment tax credit, or ITC deals for the rest of the year. And we can expect other income in Q4 will reflect seasonally higher renewables investment losses when these projects get placed into service. Okay. Let's turn to the balance sheet that's on Slide 11. And you can see it ended the quarter at $3.2 trillion, up $31 billion from the second quarter. So not a lot to note here. The driver of the increase was a $34 billion increase in available for sales securities. With cash levels so high, we chose to reduce the cash and just put some of the money into short-term T-bills this quarter, and those earn essentially the same rate as cash. Our cash remains high at $352 billion. In addition to the cash level change, we saw another $11 billion decline in hold to maturity securities as those securities matured and paid down. And as Brian noted, global excess liquidity sources remain strong at $859 billion, that's down very modestly from the second quarter, and still remains approximately $280 billion above our pre-pandemic fourth quarter '19 level. Shareholders' equity increased $4 billion from the second quarter as earnings were only partially offset by capital distributed to shareholders. During the quarter, we paid out $1.9 billion in common dividends and we bought back $1 billion in shares to offset our employee awards. AOCI was $1.1 billion lower, reflecting both a modest decline in the value of AFS securities, modestly impacting CET1 as well as a small change in cash flow hedges, which doesn't impact the regulatory capital. Tangible book value per share is up 12% year-over-year. Turning to regulatory capital. our CET1 level improved to $194 billion from June 30, and our CET1 ratio improved 30 basis points to 11.9%. It's now well above our current 9.5% requirement as Brian noted. Risk-weighted assets declined modestly as loans and Global Markets RWA both moved lower. Our supplemental leverage ratio was 62% versus a minimum requirement of 5%, which leaves capacity for balance sheet growth and our TLAC ratio remains well above our requirements. LCR ratios remain well above minimums for BAC metrics and stronger at the bank level. Let's now focus on loans by looking at average balances on Slide 12. And loan growth slowed this quarter as a decline in demand for commercial borrowing more than offset our credit card growth. So we saw that lower commercial demand in lower revolver utilization among higher funding costs. And commercial balances were also impacted by term loan repayments due to borrowers accessing other capital market solutions. Focusing for a moment on average deposits and using Slide 13. Given Brian's earlier comments, I'll just note the comparisons. Relative to pre-pandemic fourth quarter '19, average deposits are up 33%. Consumer is up 36%, with consumer checking up 45%. And you can see the other segment comparisons on the page. Turning to Slide 14. Let's extend the conversation we\u2019ve been having over the course of the past couple of quarters around management of our excess liquidity. This slide serves as a reminder of the size of our high-quality deposit book, the magnitude of deposits we have in excess of those needed to fund loans and the way we've extracted the value of that excess to deliver value back to our shareholders. The excess of deposits needed to fund loans increased from $420 billion pre-pandemic to a peak of $1.1 trillion in the fall of 2021. And as you can see, it remains high at $835 billion today. That $1.1 trillion of excess liquidity has always included a balanced mix of cash, available for sale securities, and securities we hold to maturity. In late 2020 and into 2021, we concluded that additional stimulus was going to remain in client accounts for an extended period, and we increased the hold to maturity securities portion so we could lock in value from those deposits. And we made these investments given the core nature of our customers' deposits. Note, the split of the shorter-term investments in cash and available-for-sale securities, and then the term hold to maturity securities. And I just draw your attention to just how much cash we have above the actual level we need to run the company. On the available-for-sale, we would just note the duration is less than six months as it's mostly all short-term treasuries. And the combination of the cash and available-for-sale securities represents about 47% of the total noted on this page in the third quarter of '23 to give us the balance we're looking for. And if we look at the hold-to-maturity book, it had grown from $190 billion pre-pandemic, peaking two years ago, and now falling to just over $600 billion currently. That $600 billion consists of about $122 billion in treasuries. Those will mature in a little more than six years, and about $474 billion in mortgage-backed securities and a few billion other. Hold to maturity securities peaked at $683 billion, and we're now down $80 billion from the peak and $11 billion in last quarter. That $80 billion decline from peak was all driven by the reduction of mortgages from $555 billion to $474 billion. With less loan funding needs over the past several quarters, the proceeds from security paydowns have been deployed into higher-yielding cash, and this mix shift has been happening at about a 300 basis point spread benefit for these assets. Given the increased cash rates, the combined cash and security yield has risen now to more than 3%. It's up more than 200 basis points since the peak size of the portfolio in the third quarter of '21, and it's risen faster than the rate paid on deposits. In fact, today, it's 178 basis points above what we pay for deposits. And remember also, we have $1 trillion of loans that are largely in floating rate in addition. From a valuation perspective, we did experience a decline in the valuation of the hold-to-maturity book this quarter, and that's in the context of mortgage rates reaching a two-decade high. Comparing the valuation change to the year-ago period, it worsened $15 billion. And over that same time period, we grew regulatory capital by $19 billion and hold global liquidity sources in excess of $850 billion. And importantly, as we move to Slide 15, I'll make one final comment here, which is the improved NII over this investment period. The net interest income, excluding Global Markets, which we disclose each quarter, troughed in Q3 '20 at $9.1 billion, that compares to $13.9 billion in the third quarter of '23 or $4.7 billion higher every quarter on a quarterly basis, and that gives a sense of the entire balance sheet working together. Okay. Let's now turn our focus to NII performance over the past quarter, and we'll talk about the path forward, and I'm going to use Slide 15 for that. On last quarter's call, we guided to expect Q3 NII to be about $14.2 billion to $14.3 billion on an FTE basis. Our third quarter performance turned out to be better than our guidance. And on an FTE basis, NII was $14.5 billion this quarter. We expect Q4 will be around $14 billion fully taxable equivalent, and that increases our full year guidance for NII in 2023 versus 2022 to 9% growth per year. We believe NII will hover around this expected fourth quarter $14 billion level, plus or minus, in the first half of next year, and then we anticipate modest growth in the half of 2024. By the time we get to the fourth quarter of 2024, we believe we can see NII up low single digits compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. The good news is we believe NII will likely trough around the fourth quarter level of $14 billion and begin to grow again in the middle of next year. I'd note a few caveats around that forward view I just provided. It includes an assumption that interest rates in the forward curve materialize and it includes rate cuts for the second half of 2024. It also includes an expectation of modest loan and deposit growth as we move into the second half of 2024. Focusing again on this quarter, $14.5 billion NII was an increase of nearly $700 million from the third quarter of '22, or 4%, while our net interest yield improved 5 basis points to 2.11%. The year-over-year improvement was driven by higher interest rates and partially offset by lower deposit balances. On a linked-quarter comparison, NII improved $239 million from Q2, and that comes from the benefit of an extra day of interest, a rate hike and higher global markets NII, partially offset by increased deposit pricing. And the net interest yield improved 5 basis points. Turning to asset sensitivity and focused on a forward yield curve basis, the plus 100 basis point parallel shift at September 30 was $3.1 billion of expected NII benefit over the next 12 months from our banking book. And that expects -- or that assumes no expected change in balance sheet levels or mix relative to our baseline forecast, and 95% of the sensitivity is driven by short rates. The 100 basis point down rate scenario was $3.3 billion. Okay. Let's turn to expense, and we'll use Slide 16 for the discussion. Previously highlighted that we guided you to a trend of sequential declines in our expense each quarter this year, and we achieved that in Q3 with our expense down $200 million to $15.8 billion. Additionally, we expect the fourth quarter to go down another couple of hundred million to $15.6 billion, excluding any FDIC special assessment. That would mean our fourth quarter expense of $15.6 billion, compared to the fourth quarter of '22, would be up by only $100 million or less than 1%. And we're proud of that work by the team, especially considering our regular FDIC insurance expense alone increased by $125 million quarterly starting in the first quarter of this year. So without that, we would be flat year-over-year in Q4. The decline this quarter from the second was driven by the reduction in litigation expense and lower headcount, offset somewhat by investments in inflationary costs. Our headcount is down nearly 2,800 from the second quarter to 213,000. And that includes the addition of 2,500 or so full-time campus hires we brought into the company. So that's good work by the team after we peaked at 218,000 in January month-end. And you see the movement here across the past year at the bottom left of the slide. As we look forward to next quarter, we'd add $1.9 billion of expense for the proposed notice of special assessment from the FDIC as a possibility. Absent that, we'd expect our fourth quarter $15.6 billion expense target to more fully benefit from the third quarter headcount reductions, and that will allow expense to continue the decline experienced throughout the year so far. All of that is going to set us up well for next year. Let's now turn to credit, and we'll turn to Slide 17. Net charge-offs of $931 million increased $62 million from the second quarter. The increase is driven by credit card losses as higher late-stage delinquencies flow through to charge-offs. For context, the credit card net charge-off rate rose 12 basis points to 2.72% in Q3, and it remains below the 3.03% pre-pandemic rate in the fourth quarter of '19. Provision expense was $1.2 billion in Q3, and that included a $303 million reserve build. It reflects a macroeconomic outlook that on a weighted basis continues to include an unemployment rate that rises to north of 5% during 2024. On Slide 18, we highlight the credit quality metrics for both our Consumer and our Commercial portfolios. And on Consumer, we just note that we continue to see the asset quality metrics come off the bottom. And for the most part, they remain below historical averages. 30 and 90-day consumer delinquencies still remain below the fourth quarter of 2019 as an example. Commercial net charge-offs declined from the second quarter, driven mostly by a reduction in office write-downs. And as a reminder, our CRE credit exposure represents 7% of total loans, and that includes office exposure, which represents less than 2% of our loans. We've been very intentional around client selection and portfolio concentration and deal structure over many years, and that's helped us to mitigate risk in this portfolio. We continue to believe that the portfolio is well positioned and adequately reserved against the current conditions. And in the appendix, we've included a current view of our commercial real estate and office portfolio stats we provided last quarter. We've also included the historical perspective of our loan book de-risking and our net charge-offs, and you can see all of those on Slides 36, 37, 38 and 39. Okay. Let's move on to the various lines of business and their results. And I'm going to start on Slide 19 with Consumer Banking. For the quarter, Consumer earned $2.9 billion on good organic revenue growth and delivered its 10th consecutive quarter of operating leverage, while we continue to invest for the future. Note that the top-line revenue grew 6%, while expense rose 3%. Reported earnings declined 7% year-over-year given credit costs continue to return to pre-pandemic level. And we believe this understates the underlying success of the business in driving revenue and managing costs, because PPNR grew 9% year-over-year. Much of this success is driven by the pace of organic growth of checking and card accounts, as well as investment accounts and balances, as Brian noted earlier. And expense reflects the continued investments by the business for their future growth. Moving to Wealth Management on Slide 20. We produced good results, and we earned a little more than $1 billion. These results are down from last year, due to a decline in NII from higher deposit costs, which more than offset higher fees from asset management. While lower this quarter, NII of $1.8 billion derives from a world-class banking offering, and it provides good balance in our revenue stream and a competitive advantage in the business for us. As Brian noted, both Merrill and the Private Bank continued to see strong organic growth, and they produced solid assets under management flows of $44 billion since the third quarter of last year, reflecting good mix of new client money as well as our existing clients putting their money to work. Expense reflects continued investments in the business as we add financial advisers and capabilities from technology investments. On Slide 21, you see the Global Banking results. And this business produced very strong results with earnings of $2.6 billion, driven by 11% year-over-year growth in revenue to $6.2 billion. Coupled with good expense management, the business has produced solid operating leverage. Our GTS, or Global Treasury Services business has been robust. We've also seen a steady volume of solar and wind investment projects this quarter, and our investment banking business is performing well in a sluggish environment. Year-over-year revenue growth also benefited from the absence of marks taken on leverage loans in the prior year-ago period. The company's overall investment banking fees were $1.2 billion in Q3, growing modestly over the prior year, despite a pool that was down nearly 20%. And we held on to number three position given our performance. Provision expense reflected a reserve release of $139 million as certain troubled industries and credits outside of commercial real estate continue to have improved outlooks. Expense increased 6% year-over-year, reflecting our continued investments in this business. Switching to Global Markets on Slide 22. The team had another strong quarter, with earnings growing to $1.3 billion driven by revenue growth of 10%, and I'm referring to results excluding DVA as we normally do. The continued themes of inflation, geopolitical tensions and central banks changing monetary policies around the globe have continued to impact both bond and equity markets. And as a result, it was a quarter where we saw strong performance in our FICC businesses, as well as a record third quarter in equities. Focusing on sales and trading, ex DVA, revenue improved 8% year-over-year to $4.4 billion. FICC improved 6% and equities improved 10% compared to the third quarter of last year. And at $1.7 billion, that's a record third quarter for our equities teammates. Year-over-year, expense increased 7%, primarily driven by investments for people and technology. Finally, on Slide 13, all other shows a profit of $89 million. So revenue improved from the second quarter, driven by the absence of prior period debt security sale losses and available-for-sale securities, and partially offset by higher operating losses on tax credit investments in wind, solar and affordable housing. As I mentioned earlier, our effective tax rate in the quarter was 4%, and that reflects a higher-than-expected volume of investment tax credits in which the value of the deals are recognized upfront. We also had a small discrete benefit to tax expense from a state tax law change. Excluding renewable investments and any other discrete tax benefits, our tax rate would have been 25%. And as we wrap up 2023, we expect our full year tax rate, excluding discrete and special items, such as the FDIC special assessment, we expect that full year tax rate should end up in the 9% to 10% range. So to summarize, we grew our earnings double digit year-over-year. We reported NII that was above our expectations, and we increased our full year expectations. We've managed costs aligned with our guidance and brought expenses down in every quarter so far this year, and we expect to do that again in the fourth quarter. We earned more than 15% return on tangible common equity. We returned $2.9 billion in capital back to shareholders, including a 9% dividend increase. And we built 30 basis points of CET1, positioning us well for the proposed capital rules. So all in all, it was a strong quarter. It was one where our teams executed well against responsible growth. And with that, David, I think we'll open it up for the Q&A session. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Hi, Brian. Hi, Alastair. Brian Moynihan : Hi, there. Alastair Borthwick : Hey, George. Gerard Cassidy : Brian, can you come back to your thoughts. You're talking about the consumer spending holding at 4% right now, obviously, down from the very strong levels of a year or two years ago. When you look out and you mentioned how you guys were thinking the economy troughs in the middle of next year, do you think you could hold that 4% consumer spend? Do you think your consumers will hold that 4% spending number or could it actually deteriorate from here? Brian Moynihan : I think, a couple of things, Gerard. One is the -- there's obviously external events, which could change the situation in the globe dramatically. And so -- but given just the pathway that those -- that doesn't -- that kind of event doesn't take place, you think that the rate they're spending out now is consistent with a lower inflation. So embedded in our teams [indiscernible] team's economic projections is a return to inflation, the 2% target at the end of '25. The rate structure comes down beginning in the middle of next year, but still stays around 4% at the end of '25. And so given that the economy -- the inflation is coming down, the economies would still be growing then and getting back towards trend growth, I think it would hold steady. And so it's been pretty steady, the month of August into September into October, at this 4%, 4.5%, 5% level. And that's kind of just people get paid more, they spend a little bit more and pricing goes up. And then you have the ebbs and flows within it, what they spend on. And right now, you've kind of seen all the adjustments that came through the pandemic into the last couple of years sort of adjust out of the system. What I mean by is you had a lot of goods purchase, then you had a lot of travel. You had a lot of return-to-office spending. We can track that people buying stuff. All that's kind of leveled out of the system, including a drop in fuel prices and an increase -- and basically, it's relatively bounce around about the same and they're spending about the same amount of money on gas as they spent last year. So all that being said, in the big aggregate numbers, I think, yes, it can keep bumping along at that level, which is consistent of low inflation, low growth economy, and effectively shows the consumer has been brought more in line with the scenario of the Fed reaching their target. That's what we see. Now, we'll take some time for all that to work through the system and the retail sales number seems to be stronger today, but that will all shake through, but this is what they are doing at the moment. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And then as a follow-up question, you guys gave us good detail on Slide 8 about the potential changes coming from Basel III end game, and you showed us, obviously, the organic capital generation. Can you share with us possibly some of the mitigation strategies you might use? And specifically, if you could touch upon these changes for the equity investments, particularly in the alternative energy space, I guess they're going up from 100% RWAs to 400%. Would that change your thinking in that line of business as we go forward, should they stay in the final rules? Brian Moynihan : So I think, number one, I think the first thing is there'll be -- at the end of November, the comments are due, there'll be comments by our company, by all the other companies, by industry participants, and then the staff at the Fed will have to sort through all that and think to what they all mean. And there'll be very rigorous points about our views of the wisdom of the changes, the need that changes, the balance of the changes, the double accounting, all the things you've heard much about. That being said, it is a little puzzling that you see some of the RWA increases for mortgage loans or for these types of investments in the environmental and housing and other spaces, which sort of counter the policy that we want to do it. Now what would happen is we'd have to adjust the pricing and it would become more expensive. It's been a great business for us. We continue to drive it. But ultimately, it\u2019d have to go through the market. You have the equity cost go up by a four-fold increase to get the returns. And so think about a pricing model, just increasing the amount of equity we have to dedicate, therefore, we have to get returns on that. And so that would happen. It just seems a little counterintuitive that people would be doing that on a set of rules that, basically, after the financial crisis, Dodd-Frank put in a set of rules and said here's how you count the RWA, without much evidence that this is an issue for companies because the Volcker Rule and all the stuff that are having issues of write-downs or changes here. And so the idea going up four times seems odd to us from a public policy standpoint, and also absent any evidence that this is an issue for the banking system. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. Thank you very much, Brian. Operator : We'll take our next question from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Jim Mitchell : Hey, great. Good morning. Alastair, at a conference a month ago, you noted that if the Fed is done, you think deposit pricing is close to its peak, and I think you kind of talked us through that a little bit today. Some of your peers have been more fearful of a potential future material repricing in consumer savings, for example, from greater competition or further outflows. So -- and to be fair, they're worried about that for a while and you've been more right. But can you just kind of discuss your thoughts on that and perhaps the outlook on deposit pricing in general? Alastair Borthwick : Yeah. I mean, Jim, one of the things that I think gives us some confidence around NII troughing and then growing in the back half of next year is if you think -- we've seen the last Fed hike or you believe that the last Fed hike is a month from now or two months from now. And at some point, deposit pricing is going to stop going up. And there'll be a natural lag to that, that's pretty normal. And then what you see, if you look forward into the forward curve is we've actually got Fed cuts, three of them, in the forward curve for next year. So, yes, we anticipate will be some lag. I don't think we're any different than anyone else in that regard. But we're just pointing out that as we get towards peak rates, we're getting closer now so we can begin to see the end of that in terms of the later innings at this point. And the other thing just -- we always have to remind everyone of this is, the deposits that we have are very relationship based. They're -- a lot of them are core operating deposits where we've got the checking, they're thinking about the way we serve them in terms of digital. We've got preferred reward program. And then on the Commercial side, very similar. We've got a lot of operating deposits all around the world. and they're using our world-class CashPro product. So there's a lot of relationship value here as well that we need to take into account. But fundamentally, we're just making a judgment that we're getting towards the top of the rate cycle here for Fed funds and then deposit pricing will sort out in the quarter or two following. Jim Mitchell : All right. That's fair. Maybe given the thoughts that there's three rate cuts in the forward curve and you are asset sensitive, but yet you still expect growth or improving growth in NII in the back half. Is that just sort of the lag effect there, too? Or is there something else there in terms of rate cuts and the impact? Alastair Borthwick : Yeah, I think the other things that we\u2019ve got going on, especially as we get into the back half of the year, Consumer balances are going to find the floor at some point. They again are in the late innings of returning to sort of more normal pre-pandemic balances per account. So they are going to find a floor and at that point, they're going to start growing in the same way that Wealth has found the floor, and in the same way the Global Banking found a floor a while ago and is now beginning to grow. So we have a point of view that the Consumer side is going to find the floor. So that's one. Two is, at that point, you're poised for deposit growth, but we're also going to see loan growth through the course of the year. It's been slower this quarter. But at some point, you return to a more normal economy, as Brian has pointed out, we're going to see the loan growth and so we're thinking that's going to start to evidence itself in the back half. And then the final thing I'd just say is we have securities reinvestment every month, and that's going to support and grow NII. And I think it gives us a sense that we've got a more durable NII stream underneath. Jim Mitchell : Great. That\u2019s all very helpful. Thanks. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Erika Najarian with UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Erika Najarian : Hi, good morning. I have -- my first question is sort of two-pronged on the balance sheet. Alastair, if you could tell us sort of how much in cash flow do you forecast your HTM book will have in 2024 as you think about the moving pieces underneath your NII outlook? And for Brian, clearly, this held-to-maturity portfolio has been a thorn in the side of the stock. And so -- and no matter what we say to the investment community, the stock hasn't quite caught up. And I'm wondering, as you think about the statistics that you share with us every quarter, like net new checking ads, maybe give us a little more statistics in terms of the strength of that growth and the strength of that retention. Because I think that no matter what sort of print that you have on total deposits at the end of the quarter, there's always sort of pushback so long as the market is not yet confident that we've hit peak rates. So that\u2019s sort of a two-part first question. Alastair Borthwick : All right. So I'll answer the first part, Erika. I think if you look back through the course of the last couple of years, that portfolio paydowns in terms of maturities or paydowns, it's sort of averaging $10 billion a quarter. So I think you could probably use that as a good starting point for the reinvestment horizon in 2024. That's what I would use. And then I'll let Brian answer the second part of your question. Brian Moynihan : So, Erika, we drive a organic growth machine based on a responsible set across all the different operating businesses. So as you've noted, if you look at what's driving our deposit base to be larger than the industry, i.e., outperforming the industry is, if you think from -- everybody compares against '19 to now and we're up $250 billion in Consumer deposit loan, but we also are up probably 10% in checking accounts, net checking accounts. Those are 92% core. The attrition rate and where all the deposit balances are in the preferred part of that segment is 99% -- the retention rate is 99% plus long-term customers, the preferred rewards program drives a basis. On cards, we're now getting the balances back up to where they pre-pandemic was even better credit quality than we had then. We got home equities hit a trough and are starting to work their way out. Auto loans are start -- it will continue to produce a lot. The market is not real strong, we continue to produce several billion a quarter. So all the organic growth engine in the Consumer business are very strong. When you go to Wealth Management, we're now producing that household growth at a faster rate than we produced in the prior years. If you go to the Commercial Banking businesses in the US, we noted that we produced more customers this year. And that deposit base in the business banking and middle market segments, those come with a big deposit franchise. And you see that those deposits have actually been stable and growing for last six months. So the organic growth engine is in fine shape and just powers through all this and is the strength of the $3 trillion plus balance sheet. And in fact, it is the reason that we have $1 trillion of -- $900 billion on a given day that we have to put to work because you're just having this great engine go on. And so whether it's investment accounts in Consumer, checking accounts in Consumer, cards in Consumer, home equity, all that has grown organically dramatically over the last four, five, 10 years. And frankly, the loan growth will continue to follow that as conditions improve. And then on the Commercial side, as people go back to regular line usage, we saw it deteriorate this quarter and it\u2019s due to the demand side, and so we feel very good. And then you talked about the markets business, gave you detail there. And the investment banking team is gaining market share and actually [fought] (ph) to maintain relatively flat fees in a market that was down 20% or something. So we feel very good about the organic growth engine. That's what powers our company, and that delivered $7 billion plus in after-tax income for another quarter and 15% return on tangible common equity. Erika Najarian : Got it. And my second question is for you, Alastair. Do you have any economic ownership of Visa Class B shares remaining? Our understanding is until the litigation was settled, you weren't allowed to sell it other than to other banks in the initial consortium. But I'm wondering if you've sold any economic ownership through swap or if we still have it on the books because we haven't seen any disclosures on that recently. Alastair Borthwick : Well, I mean, we essentially sold and hedged our Visa B position years ago. And then in our markets business, we've financed the sale of Visa by other banks. You can think about that as a hedge thing that's just about financing. So depending on how that all develops and what other banks choose to do, we may end up having some RWA or some liquidity that we can recycle for other clients' benefit in our markets business, but we don't have any meaningful economic stake in Visa B. Erika Najarian : Got it. Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Mike Mayo : Do you expect the efficiency ratio expenses to revenues to improve from 63% and when? And I guess this is a two-part question. One is expenses. As you said, it's down every quarter this year and you're guiding for the fourth quarter. Slide 5, the digital adoption, it\u2019s about three-fourth for your clients across the firm. So the sustainability of those digital trends to help lower expense or control expenses, given some of the headwinds. And especially given the threat of big tech and fintechs, the sustainability of the digital trends and why you think you have an advantage on so many others. I think they have the advantage. And the second part of that question is revenues. Your NIM is a bit over 2%. Went up a little quarter-over-quarter, but it was closer to 2.5%. Going back five years and maybe long term, it should be 3%. I'm not sure. So what do you think is a normalized NIM? Because that would help the efficiency ratio and the trend for expenses and ultimately, the efficiency ratio? Thanks. Brian Moynihan : So Mike, I think the expenses come down, revenue grows, the efficiency ratio continues to improve. One of the big differences between us and other companies you can compare us to is the size of our Wealth Management business relative to the size of the company is large. And as you know, that's a business which we continue to work to make more efficient, but is the least efficient business in the platform. So Lindsay and Eric continue to drive the efficiency there. So yes, we expect the efficiency ratio to continue to improve. And part of that will be as the net interest margin normalizes, we normalize the size of the balance sheet, given it's grossed up for a lot of reasons through the pandemic and stuff and you kind of fine-tune it, you'll get a little more effectiveness there. In the past, we ran up to [2.30%] (ph) in NIM in a sort of normalized sort of environment, and you'd expect us to keep moving up from there. Now it will be it'll be bouncing around here as we work through the trough in NII that we described, which is we're sort of in the middle of starting this quarter into the first half of next year. So, Mike, and as you know, it's all about management heads, and that's -- last year, at this time, we all talked about the great resignation or last year last summer and how we had to hire people, we over-hired because the issue was could you hire fast enough to get what you needed this year. We're able to bring that excess back out of the system and ended up kind of where we wanted to be at 212,000. As we think forward, we continue to reposition people around the company who are freed up because of that digital application to other things. So in a broad sense, our Consumer business is down from 100,000 people to 60,000 people and continues to drift down as we continue to use the -- that's the place of the most leverage in digital across the board, you continue to get less branches, less ATMs. You can see the statistics on the chart. More customer interactions and more customers, that's a pretty good trade, and we continue to drive that, including sales in digital that we disclosed in the back of things. You're running nearly half the sales and, frankly, with improvements on the checking account opening, we can drive another round of growth there. So that's what we're going to do. We continue to drive the efficiency ratio to a level, and we'll see where we can get it to. Mike Mayo : And then just on that big picture question, I mean, you've invested for over a decade in your data and tech stack and digital engagement. And now we have AI and GenAI as a new opportunity and a threat. Why do you think -- or maybe you don't, why do you think that you have an advantage versus, say, smaller banks, fintechs or big tech? Brian Moynihan : Well, we have an advantage in that we've been applying it for a number of years now. So effectively, Erica is a form of that and now has 17 million customers working on it everything. And so think about that this quarter, I think there's [170] (ph) million interactions, whatever the number is, 180 million interactions, something like that. If you think about that, Mike, in the days gone by, every one of those would have been an e-mail, a text or a phone call. And so it's obviously tremendously more efficient. And we're continuing to prove we brought it out to the CashPro side, which is the Commercial side. So that helps. If you think about in the $3.8 billion we'll spend in '24 on technology initiative spending, Aditya and the team continue to use the techniques that you read about in the paper to increase the efficiency of that development effort. And it's probably 10%, 15% in the short term, building up higher and as people get more and more used to it, and that will allow those dollars to be stretched even further. So we think that's a near-term application that we're already doing and has high probability. And then, frankly, if you think about our capabilities, if you look, we have nearly, I don't know, 6,000, 7,000 patents out there, 600 on AI already related -- machine learning-related activities sitting in the application filed. We got a lot of inventors in this company. And so we feel good about our ability to compete against the types of people you said. But by the way, we use some of those people who might compete to actually be providers to help us do this stuff. And some of the big tech companies are -- as you listen to them, they have -- it's a business for them to sell that AI capabilities to companies like ours to make us more efficient. So near term customer help, near term employee effectiveness, near term coding enhancements, et cetera, et cetera. But one thing we mentioned is we have invested heavily to have the data in a tech stack ready to go and 3-point-whatever billion dollars and 1 billion interactions this quarter in digital show that the people are ready to use the services we provide them. Mike Mayo : Okay. Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Steven Chubak : Hey, good morning, Brian. Good morning, Alastair. Brian Moynihan : Good morning. Steven Chubak : So I wanted to start off with a question on expense. You cited headcount actions, it should provide relief in 4Q and positive flowthrough into next year. I was hoping you could either help size the benefit from expense actions or just frame how we should be thinking about expense growth as we look out to next year. Alastair Borthwick : Well, I think what we've tried to do this year, Steve, is communicate pretty clearly what our plan was. As Brian said, we overachieved last year on hiring. So we started the year with 218,000 and expense of $16.2 billion. And we've really been working on the trajectory over the course of this year. So this point of getting the headcount and to a place where we're comfortable, $16.2 billion turns into $16 billion, turns into $15.8 billion, we're now determined to deliver on the $15.6 billion, and I think that's going to set up really well. So our plan is to finalize our strategic planning over the course of the next few weeks, and I think we'll give you more guidance next quarter. Steven Chubak : Great. And just two clarifying questions or cleanup questions on my end. On the NII remarks, you talked about deposits. I was hoping you could help frame, Alastair, what are the assumptions you're making in terms of reinvestment yields and loan growth that are underpinning that higher NII exit rate for next year? Alastair Borthwick : Yeah. So I'd say reinvestment, just assume the forward curve. And with respect to loan growth, I\u2019d use low single digits, consistent with a slow growth economy. Steven Chubak : Okay. And just one quick one here on the tax advantage investments. I just wanted to confirm, given the long duration, the 4x increase in capital, are you still planning to fund tax advantage investments on the platform before the rules are finalized? Or are you going to take a wait-and-see approach? Alastair Borthwick : Well, I mean this remains something that's important for our clients. We've yet to see a final rule. So we'll be supporting transactions. But obviously, as Brian said, it is informing us with respect to pricing, and it's informing us with respect to appetite. But until there's a change, we'll continue to support the clients in that regard. Steven Chubak : Understood. Thanks so much for taking my questions. Operator : We'll take our next question from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Matt O\u2019Connor: Hi, good morning. First, just to clarify, what's driving the drop in net interest income from 3Q to 4Q? Is that core net interest income? Or is that on the market side? Alastair Borthwick : Well, you're talking about the fact that we think that we're going to be around $14-or-so billion in Q4. I'd say, first one is you've got a little bit of deposit pricing lag there. So we got to keep thinking about that. Second is we're sort of baking into it some continued normalization of Consumer balances. So that's just continuing to drift slowly lower. I think third, if we had hoped for loan growth in Q3, we just didn't see that. So that's going to flow through with lower loan growth balances in Q4. And then the only final thing I'd just say is the Global Markets NII may not repeat in quite the same way. Some of that depends on client behavior. And they benefited this particular quarter by just long-term rates going up so significantly and not helping the carry side. So it\u2019s all those things and probably a little bit of rate hike probability or timing delayed, but it's all those sorts of things. It hasn\u2019t -- what importantly hasn't changed is it hasn't changed from our expectation a quarter ago in any way. Matt O\u2019Connor: Yeah. Okay. That's helpful. And then just conceptually, as we think about your interest income guidance for next year, what if we get higher for longer rates, there's no cuts. Is that good or bad versus the guidance that you gave earlier? Obviously, you've got puts and takes to some reinvestment on the asset side. But again, coming back to the deposit pricing issue, I think there's a view that higher for longer eventually drives up the Consumer rates. So what would be the net of those two in the higher for longer? Thank you. Alastair Borthwick : Well, higher for longer is going to be better. So you're right, we've got the forward curve and our expectations, if that doesn't turn out to be the case, we'd expect NII would be higher. Matt O\u2019Connor: And that's simply the assets repricing more of the deposits or are you still thinking there's minimal consumer deposit or pricing even in the higher for longer? Alastair Borthwick : It will be both. I mean there'll be the repricing for sure. And in addition, we'd expect to capture a little bit of margin from any short-term rate hike. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay. I understand. Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from John McDonald with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open. John McDonald : Yeah. I was hoping you could give a little color on what you're seeing on credit. Your outlook as you look at roll rates and migrations, how are you thinking about the trajectory of charge-offs in the near term? Alastair Borthwick : Well, John, I'll just point out, you can see the trajectory, we've laid it out on the slide. Most of the net charge-off increase over time has been really due to card and Consumer card. And the charge-offs at this point are still lower than they were in the fourth quarter of '19, which was a stellar period. And I'd anticipate in the short term that you'd see things begin to -- or just continue that trend. Because it normally follows 90 days past due delinquencies and those are up ever so slightly against quarter. So we're inching closer to the fourth quarter of '19. And at some point, that's going to begin to stabilize. From there, it's just a question of what does the economy do. So right now, as Brian has pointed out, we've had a slow growth economy in the plan. So I'd anticipate as we get back towards that kind of fourth quarter '19 number, it's going to normalize in there. But from that point, it will be very economic dependent. On the Commercial side, the asset quality has been excellent. The only place where we've got particular elevated concern is office, which is a very small part of our portfolio. It's less than 2% of our loans. But the Commercial side has been terrific. And again, that will depend on how the economy plays out, and whether we're talking about a soft landing, whether we're talking about a recession or whether we're talking about robust growth. So all of that is going to have to play itself out. With the Commercial numbers being so low, that one could bounce around a little bit, but it's only because it's coming off a base that's so low at this point. Brian Moynihan : John, just one thing on as you think about the Commercial credit. Remember, we have a strong, disciplined ratings change, rating capability in this company. And so we are pushing through the reviews of the commercial real estate portfolio, et cetera. We put them on, criticized quickly. We had to deal with the charge-offs, and that's why you see them come back already in. And we're adjusting those activities as we show in the slides in the part of the deck, to current appraisals, under market conditions, under current rent rolls, et cetera. And so even though it's a very small part of our portfolio, frankly, a lot of the issues are through the system for us because the high ratings integrity and ratings conservatism we've had in this company for many, many years. And that holds us well. And I always -- if you think back like in the oil and gas thing in the end of '15, '16, we put up all of this reserve that was pre-CECL and then end up bringing it back in because the charge-offs were very modest. So I think we feel very good about the original underwriting, but you also have -- because of our ratings integrity on the office part of the portfolio, we pushed a fairly significant amount through reappraisal and relook, and we have the CECL reserves. But importantly, the charge-offs are falling already. John McDonald : Got it. And one bigger picture question as you think about the Basel III and the opportunity to mitigate and optimize. Does a 15% ROTCE feel like a good aspiration for the company over time, Brian, through the cycle? I mean I\u2019m recognizing that's where you are already today. But as you factor in the potential for new rules, anything about that? Brian Moynihan : Yeah, so I think we're doing on a -- I think a simple way to think about is we're doing on $194 billion of capital, which we did at this quarter. And that is -- you need about another, say, $10 billion to put a buffer on the end state need, $10 billion to $11 billion, $195 billion plus, 0.5% which is our normal buffer, without any mitigation. That would be a very modest increase of $10 billion over $200 billion, let's make it simple. And that would hit the ROTCE a bit. And I'm sure we can figure out ways to price to get that back. But remember, we're different than everybody else, John, because we're actually sitting on this amount of capital today. And so we are getting a 15% return on it. So I don't want to -- don\u2019t take that as saying, I agree with the rules, but saying, we've got to deal with the cards that are dealt to us. The rules say that you have to have $195 billion plus about $10 billion cushion for, and maybe a little bit more cushion, but depending on, for 50 basis points or so. But, we're doing 15% today, so that'd be a slight dilution to that number, but not something we couldn't make up. And that's before any mitigation, honestly. And there's always mitigation. You know that. You've been around this industry for a long time. So there's always mitigation, how you construct things, what you'll do, what you'll not do. And I fully expect there'll be modifications in the rules, which ought to help also. But I think the simple point is we earn that amount of capital today, so it's not like some calculation I have to think through. It's right there today. John McDonald : Yeah, that's a good perspective. Thanks, Brian. Operator : We'll take our next question from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Vivek Juneja : Thanks. Alastair, question, just want to clarify your NII comment. So if rates stay higher or better, are you implying that rate cuts would therefore be negative for you from an NII standpoint? Alastair Borthwick : Yeah, I'm saying right now, Vivek, that if you think about what rate cuts look like in the back half of next year, in the absence of that, we might guide NII higher, yes. That's what I'm trying to communicate. Vivek Juneja : And is that because your assets -- you have that many floating rate assets that would reprice faster than you can cut funding costs? Alastair Borthwick : Yeah. On the way down, I'd anticipate that as rates are going down, it's going to cut into our margin on our deposit spreads. So that's essentially what we're talking about. Brian Moynihan : Yeah, Vivek, I think I've just listened to you and Alastair. I think, remember, the forward curve has multiple cuts in it next year. And I think the question earlier was, if those didn't occur, what would happen? And I think Alastair said NII would be higher if those cuts didn't occur. It's not a rate, -- it's just mathematically at 75 basis points in the second half of next year of not being cut would hold us higher because of all the deposits being worth more and the floating rate assets holding pricing up better. That's a dominant part of our balance sheet. I just sensed that you were talking about each other, but maybe not. Vivek Juneja : Okay. Thanks. Operator : We'll take our next question from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Ken Usdin : Thank you. Just a follow-up on the securities portfolio on the AFS side, Alastair, how much of that $180 billion is still swapped? And can you kind of help us understand like what the kind of all-in yield is on that book? And if you would still also have repricing help going forward on that book as well as you mentioned earlier on the HTM maturities? Alastair Borthwick : Yeah. So most of the book we swapped to floating. We've tried to establish that over the course of time. So you can almost think about most all of the available-for-sale securities repricing kind of every day, every week, every two weeks, whatever it may be. So that tends to look a little bit more like the cash tide moves over time. There's a few securities in there that are fixed rate, but very, very little in terms of the total complexion, Ken. Ken Usdin : Okay. That helps. Thank you. And then just wanted to also say, on the fee side, obviously, another really good job both on the Investment Bank and the trading businesses, still an uncertain environment. Just wanted to get your thoughts. You were able to hold the IB fees flat sequentially, which was, I think, better than you had indicated. Just your thoughts on reopening here in the markets and how you're kind of expecting the business to hopefully, albeit understanding it's still an uncertain environment. Alastair Borthwick : Yeah. So this is -- I suppose, unusual and not unusual. Investment Banking, obviously, has the potential for swings in fees. And what's interesting about this one is, would that be bouncing around this sort of $1.1 billion per quarter, $1.2 billion per quarter. And normally, investment banking you'd expect to return within a year or so, and we're now seven quarters into this. So we've got a good pipeline. And mostly what I think corporate America and around the world, C-suite executives are looking for, is the confidence that comes from macroeconomic certainty, geopolitical certainty. So for as long as we've got the volatility, it's going to stay in this kind of a range. But if you were to look back in periods past, Investment Banking can come back very, very quickly to a more historical range of kind of $1.3 billion, $1.4 billion, $1.5 billion per quarter. It's just that we've grown tired of predicting when that might be, Ken. Brian Moynihan : Yeah, Ken, let me give you two other pieces. One, the pipeline still is strong. But more importantly, Matthew and the team have done a good job of building out our capabilities to serve our huge middle market client base, our global commercial banking client base under Wendy's leadership. And that number is growing quickly, and that's a market which is, we're relatively unpenetrated in. We had good market share with our clients that we did business with, but we -- meaning investment banking business with, and so that's generating probably better performance for us than others in terms of holding our position flat relative to up a little bit year-over-year, flat year-over-year versus a down market. So we basically doubled the size of that team, and we'll double it again. It's that kind of opportunity for us. Ken Usdin : Got it. Great. Thank you for the color. Operator : We'll take our next question from Manan Gosalia with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Manan Gosalia : Hi, good morning. So my question was around deposit growth and what level of deposit growth you think you need from here. Should it be in line with loan growth? Or are you happy to let some of the more maybe non-transaction deposits run off? And the reason I ask is because as noted in some of the prior questions, some of our peers are saying that there's more room for Consumer deposits to reprice higher, especially core checking accounts. It sort of sounds like you disagree with that. So wanted to assess how much you might need to respond if competitors act differently. Brian Moynihan : So a couple things. One, just broad base, we have a $1.9 trillion deposit, $1 trillion of loan. So we have a tremendously high deposit base. But also, if you think about, if you look at the Slide 5 or whatever, as we show the deposits by business, in the banking business, Global Banking, I think six quarters we've been relatively flat, so, and starting to grow off of that. That is fully priced at -- it's not like corporate treasurers wait around to talk to you about what you're paying and the noninterest-bearing percentage has drifted down. The amount they hold in excess of that, part of that to pay fees has been relatively stable. And so, we feel very good about that. Looking at Wealth Management, basically all the movement was made -- has been made pretty much to the higher rate environment, i.e. buying treasury securities directly. If you look in our Wealth Management business, the amount of short-term cash-oriented type investments, money market funds, et cetera, treasuries, et cetera, has gone from like $500 billion to $700 billion or $800 billion over the last several -- last couple of years. So that move has taken place. And so the rest of it is now in a relatively stable base. You can see those numbers flat. If you go to the consumer side, there's basically two or three things. One is, in the medium income households plus or minus, you're seeing the slow spend down even though they still have multiples of what they had pre-pandemic in their accounts. And even though that's a small part of the overall deposit base, there's still this low trend that where that's drifting down as all the things you read about go on. And the higher end part of that base, in a broad consumer base, they're actually below the pandemic by about 20%. And that's because they moved the money into the market. And you can see that in some of the preferred category of pricing. So where people think about checking and money markets and this, we think, I always have thought about it a little more straightforward, which is transactional cash and investment cash. The investment cash has largely been re-suited across the businesses. The transactional cash holds because it's money in motion moving every day. And for our Consumer business, that\u2019s represented by the $0.5 trillion of checking account balance, as you can see on the page, with some modest amounts in money markets and stuff that are carried as the cushion people have. And if they've moved the money to market, they've moved it. And so we're watching Consumer because there's a little more drifting there, and it's up $250 billion since pre-pandemic. And you're saying you have the dynamics of loans, student loan repayment starting, that's a million of our customers pay student loans. You have the dynamics of interest rate impacts on cash carry of loan balance if that's higher. And that'll sort out, but just takes a lot longer. That's across 37 million people. So it\u2019s a -- the impact takes a while to sort through. And so we feel good about it. But I think people look by category in this and that. You have to think about more how a customer, which a business or consumer, behaves. And what we've seen them is adjust their behavior based on their household circumstances, and largely through the system, and most of it coming a little bit slower in consumer, just because natural question is there, if there are a lot of stimulus went in those accounts, what do I do with it over time? And now they're doing something. Manan Gosalia : Got it. That's helpful detail. So I guess just in terms of deposit growth from here, would you still prefer to grow deposits in line with loans? Or is there a little bit more room for that to come down? Brian Moynihan : We prefer to grow deposits in line with customer growth and activity. So in the last four quarters, Consumer I think were up another 900,000. Net new checking accounts, which average balance is around $11,000, they come in lower than that and mature after that. We grow -- we have a transactional banking business for all types of customers and we grow irrespective of it. That produces $2 trillion. You have a loan business to customers, that produces $1 trillion, and that difference then is a wonderful thing to have every day. Manan Gosalia : I appreciate it. Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Chris Kotowski : Yeah. Good morning. Thanks. I've been looking at your average balance sheet on Page 8 of the supplement, and I noticed that in this quarter, your overall yield on earning assets was up 20 basis points, and lo and behold, the yield on interest-bearing liabilities was also up 20 basis points. And I\u2019m curious, was there some benefit unusual, the lower amortization or something like that? Or is it just a function of that -- behind all the moving parts of balances better than you thought? Alastair Borthwick : Well, I don't think it was an amortization issue. I think it was just the -- way the entire balance sheet works across assets, liabilities, when you think about all the various moving pieces. So I don't think there's anything particularly notable there. Chris Kotowski : Okay. No, it's just stunning with all the moving pieces how the earning asset yield and the liability yields really moved in tandem. All right, that's it for me. Thank you. Operator : For our final question today, we have a follow-up from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Vivek Juneja : Thanks. Brian, trading has grown nicely in equities. You've had -- you said it was led by financing. Is there room in your balance sheet from a capital standpoint to keep growing that? And second question related to trading would be, in your guidance on NII for next year, what are you assuming for trading NII in there? Brian Moynihan : Let me just hit the first one. Alastair can hit the second one. The capacity, if you think about the constraint on RWA, as you know, Vivek, and your experience in the business, that equity financing is not RWA intense. So -- but it is asset size intense. Now, when you look at us with our supplemental leverage ratio, 100 plus basis points over the requirements, we have lots of room on the asset size if we want. And the return on equity -- the return on the risk in that business is very strong. So Jim and the team have done a good job and [indiscernible] equities side. And we continue to experience that there's plenty of room. And in fact, we have brought the balance sheet up by over $200 billion largely due to the financing side. A lot of that due to equities, and we can continue to do that if the clients need the capabilities in the product. So that's a simple answer. Yes, there's a lot of capacity, and it\u2019s largely driven by our huge capital base and our effect on all the size measures were way over the requirements. I think 100 basis points on that is probably almost $50 billion of overage, so you have a lot of room to go. Alastair Borthwick : And then, Vivek, in terms of the NII guidance, we include Global Markets in there. So it's just part of a big diversified portfolio. I think we would point to, Global Markets remains liability sensitive. You can see that in the way NII has come down in '21 and '22 and into '23 with rates going up. So it will perform according to the rate curve. And then we may put a little bit of modest balance sheet growth in there, as Brian pointed out, just to continue investing in the business. But it's in the NII guide, and it will follow the forward curve. Vivek Juneja : Thank you. Brian Moynihan : Well, thank you for joining us. Just in closing, I'll go back to the key points. Strong earnings for the company. Earnings growth year-over-year for the three months and nine months in double digit. The returns of 15% return on tangible common equity are very strong. We have the capital to meet the new capital rules as proposed before any mitigation, before any changes in those rules. And we're returning 15% on that capital today. So we feel good about the path ahead to the company. We continue to do it the old-fashioned way, growing our clients, growing our revenues from those clients and driving responsible growth. Thank you. Operator : This does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect.",

Later, you'll have the opportunity to ask questions during the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please note this call may be recorded. I'll be standing by if you should need any assistance. It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Lee McEntire. Lee McEntire : Good morning. Welcome, and thank you for joining the call to review our fourth quarter and full year results. We know it's a busy day for all of you. As usual, our earnings release documents are available on the Investor Relations section of bankofamerica.com website, and they include the earnings presentation that we will be referring to during this call. I trust everybody's had a chance to review the documents. I'll first turn the call over to our CEO, Brian Moynihan, for some opening comments before, Alastair Borthwick, our CFO, discusses the details of the quarter. Let me just remind you that we may make forward-looking statements and refer to non-GAAP financial measures during the call. Forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause our actual results to materially differ from those expectations are detailed and our earnings materials and the SEC filings that are available on our website. Information about our non-GAAP financial measures, including reconciliations to US GAAP can also be found in our earnings materials and our website. So with that, I'll turn the call over to you, Brian. Thank you very much. Brian Moynihan : Thank you, and Happy New Year to everyone. Good morning. Thank you for joining us. I'm starting on Slide 2 of the earnings presentation. Here at Bank of America, our teammates finished 2023 with a solid fourth quarter. Reported EPS was $0.35, but that included two notable items that Alastair will describe in more detail. Adjusted for those two items, net income was $5.9 billion after tax or $0.70 per share. Before Alastair covers quarter four results, I want to take a moment and briefly review the 2023 full year results. Our team at Bank of America delivered strong profits for shareholders across a challenging year, navigating a slowing economy, geopolitical tensions, bank failures, and the impact of a rate hike of historic speed. We began the year with a pretentious aura as economists predicted a mild recession within the year. Instead, 2023 showcased economic resilience led by US consumers despite higher interest rates. We ended 2023 with economists projecting the Fed has successfully steered the US economy to a soft landing. In regards to the economy, during 2023, we consistently made a few points regarding what we were seeing in our customer data here at Bank of America. First, the year-over-year growth rate in spending from the beginning of '23 started declining. And it went from, in the early part of '23 over the early part of '22 from a 9% to 10% growth rate to this quarter's 4% to 5% growth rate and that's where it stands here early in 2024. You can see that on Page -- Slide 29 in the appendix. That growth rate, 4% to 5%, is more consistent with a 2% GDP environment and a lower inflation environment. Second, the point we've made is that our consumer deposit balances at Bank of America remained 30% higher than pre-pandemic. We saw the deposit balance of consumer accounts move lower this quarter, but are now seeing more differentiation in behavior. In the lower average balance size accounts, the balances in there still remain at multiples of pre-pandemic levels, nearly three years past last stimulus. They are modestly declining. The deposit outflows you've seen in consumer have largely been driven by the higher-balance accounts who've moved their excess balances into the markets to seek higher yields. We capture those with our leading wealth platform. Third, the consumers of Bank of America have had access to credit and are borrowing responsibly. The balance sheets are generally in good shape. And while impacted by higher rates, remember, many of them have fixed-rate mortgages and remain employed. So they've shown great resilience. Let's move to discussion of full year 2023 earnings. We reported net income of $26.5 billion after tax, which includes $2.8 billion after tax for notable quarter four items. Adjusted for those items, adjusted net income was $29.3 billion after tax. Earnings per share were $3.42 and that grew 7% over 2022. On that adjusted basis, we generated a 90 basis point return on assets and a 15% return on tangible common equity. The year 2023 was characterized by a record organic customer activity, record digital customer engagement levels and satisfaction scores, strong but slowing NII during the course of the year, strong sales and trading up 7% year-over-year, operating leverage reflected good expense discipline, solid asset quality and a strong capital and liquidity position. All this was helped by the years of Bank of America's assiduous dedication to responsible growth. This helped us bring our headcount and expense down every quarter during 2023, in line with what we told you to expect early this year -- early last year. Adjusted full year revenue grew 5% on the back of 9% NII improvement and strong asset management fees and sales and trading results. We achieved 170 basis points of operating leverage in 2023 as heightened quarterly expense levels were driven lower throughout the year even as the investments in growth continued. Net charge-offs moved higher through the year off the historic lows, but they still compare very favorably against historic averages. One last point worth noting is the level of deposits. If you think back as we ended 2022 and entered 2023, the great debate was how much the pandemic surge in deposits would dissipate. But looking today, we ended 2023 with $1.924 trillion of deposits, only $7 billion less than we had at year-end '22 and 4% higher than the trough in May of this year. The total deposits -- the total average deposits in the fourth quarter remained 35% higher than they did in the quarter four of 2019. This has been tremendous works by our teams to drive our industry-leading market share, actually outperforming the industry across the four-year period, and again this year. While the economy appears to continue to normalize and rates continue to have some volatility, one thing that remains important is driving that organic growth. This client activity sticks to the ribs is what we want to spend a moment as I wrap up. On Slide 3, we highlight some of the successes in organic activity in our results for the year. Bank of America team is a powerful engine that's fueling results across all our businesses. I would note a couple of examples to try and connect the importance to our financials. It's easy to use the consumer business as an example. In consumer, we added 600,000 net new checking accounts during the year 2023. The fourth quarter of 2023 represents the 20th straight quarter of net addition of head -- of checking accounts. The quality is what drives the checking account balances. On average, 67% of the deposit balances have been with us for customers who have been with us for more than 10 years. 92% of the consumer checking accounts are primary, meaning they're the core client household account. 60% of our checking accounts use their debit card. They average 400 transactions per account each year, showing how engaged they are. They have traditionally opened savings accounts 20% to 25% of the time within a few months of opening their checking accounts. Thinking about those new accounts, at opening those new checking accounts opened last year, bring in about $4,000 of balances. Then they deepen over the next subsequent months to two times that amount. New saving accounts come with those accounts, starting with about $8,000 and doubling over time. From the total new checking accounts we opened just in 2023, those customers have opened nearly 0.5 million credit card accounts with us so far in 2023. Historically, we've seen on average these customers more than doubled those card balances within a year. Those card accounts on average have spent about $7,000 per year, of which a portion will carry a balance. Now, there's always additional opportunity to further serve our clients and to continue to meet them where they are. In addition to the industry-leading digital platforms that we have, we have opened 50 new financial centers in 2023. More than half of those were in our expansion markets. We've expanded our presence during 2023 to 10 markets, including our latest opening in Omaha. In our global wealth management team, we added more than 40,000 net new relationships across Merrill and the Private Bank. Our advisors opened 150,000 new banking accounts for wealth management clients, showing the completeness of the relationship approach. The average Merrill account is over $1 million at opening. The average private bank account is multiples of that. As you can see on the slide, we now manage $5.4 trillion of client balances across loans, deposits, investments of our consumer clients, both consumer and GWIM. We saw $84 billion of flows into those accounts last year. As we switch to Global Banking on the lower-left-hand side of the slide, we added clients to increase the number of products per relationship. Just like in consumer, we have seen good growth in customers seeking the benefits of our physical and digital capabilities, but most importantly, our talent relationship managers who provide financing solutions, treasury services, strategic advice for clients with local and global needs. We added roughly 2,500 new commercial and business banking clients this year. That is more than twice what we added in 2022. We look forward to continue to drive with those -- grow with those clients in '24 and add even more. This capitalized on a multi-year build of our relationship management team in the Global Banking businesses, especially in product expansion also, especially in the global transaction services area and mid-market investment bank. As we think about global markets, we continue to see strong performance from our team with 7% year-over-year revenue growth, the strongest we've had in many years. We see digital tools our customers have access to across the board, helping us enable this activity at lower costs. Our normal digital banking slides are once again included for your reference on Pages 21, 24 and 26. In summary, this was a good quarter. We delivered our third quarter of expense declines. We saw NII outperform what we expected when we talked to you on the last earnings call. We continue to manage well through the transition and the rate structure. We saw deposits grow this quarter. And we look forward with a strong capital base, strong liquidity and growing loans and deposits to a greet 2024. I want to thank my teammates for what they did for us in 2023, and we all know we're off to a nice start for '24. With that, I'll turn it over to Alastair. Alastair Borthwick : Thank you, Brian. And I'm going to start on Slide 4 of the earnings presentation to provide just a little more context on the summary income statement and the highlights. For the fourth quarter, as Brian noted, we reported $3.1 billion in net income or $0.35 per diluted share. That GAAP net income number included two notable items. First, we recorded $2.1 billion of pretax expense, that's $0.20 after-tax earnings per share for the special assessment by the FDIC to recover losses from the failures of Silicon Valley and Signature Bank. Second, on November 15th 2023, Bloomberg announced that they would discontinue publishing the Bloomberg Short-Term Bank Yield Index rate after November 15th 2024 and many commercial loans in the industry had BSBY as a reference rate prior to SOFR becoming industry-standard. As noted in an 8-K we filed earlier this week, we came to conclusion in early January that BSBY cessation would not get the same accounting treatment allowed under LIBOR cessation. And therefore cash-flow hedges of BSBY indexed products related to BSBY cash flows, forecast to occur after November 15th 2024, we need to be moved out of OCI into earnings in the fourth quarter of '23 financials. So as a result of the accounting interpretation, we recorded a negative pretax impact to our market making revenue of approximately $1.6 billion. I just want to reinforce that's an accounting impact. It's not an economic change to the contracts and we'll see an offset to this over time through higher NII mostly occurring in 2025 and 2026 after BSBY ceases in November 2024. The accounting lowered CET1 by 8 basis points during the quarter and we will recapture that in the next two or three years. Adjusted for the FDIC assessment and the BSBY cessation related impact, Q4 net income was $5.9 billion, or $0.70 per share. On Slide 5, we show the highlights of the quarter and we reported revenue of $22.1 billion on an FTE basis. And excluding the BSBY cessation impact, adjusted revenue was $23.7 billion and declined 4%, driven by net interest income. Fourth quarter revenue is a tough year-over-year comparison as NII peaked in the fourth quarter of '22 at $14.8 billion, before slowly moving lower over 2023. Outside of NII, we saw good growth in treasury service fees and wealth management fees and those were offset by higher tax-advantaged investment deal activity, creating higher operating losses and the more tax credits associated with them and recognized across periods. Expense for the quarter of $17.7 billion included the $2.1 billion FDIC charge. So excluding that charge, adjusted expense was $15.6 billion and consistent with our prior guidance. That allowed us to invest for growth, as well as use good expense discipline to eliminate work and reduce headcount. And on an adjusted basis, this then is the third quarter of sequential expense decline this year. Provision expense for the quarter was $1.1 billion, that consisted of $1.2 billion in net charge-offs and a modest reserve release, reflecting the improved macroeconomic outlook. Net charge-offs reflect the continued trend in consumer and commercial charge-offs towards more normalized levels as well as higher commercial real-estate office losses. Lastly, our income tax expense this quarter was a modest benefit as credits from tax-advantaged investment deals offset the tax expense on the lower earnings in Q4 driven by the notable charges. So let's review the balance sheet on Slide 6, and you'll see we ended the quarter at $3.2 trillion of total assets, up $27 billion from the third quarter. I'd highlight here, both the $39 billion growth in deposits and a decline in cash on balance sheet of $19 billion. Overall, you'll note the debt securities increased $92 billion. And that included a $9 billion decline in hold-to-maturity securities, and $100 billion increase in available-for-sale securities reflecting short term investment of liquidity from all of these activities. We continue to put money into very short-term T-bills and hedged treasury notes this quarter and those are essentially earning the same rate as cash. And you can see our absolute cash levels remain quite high. As Brian noted, liquidity remained strong with $897 billion of global excess liquidity sources. That was up $38 billion from the third quarter of '23 and it remained $321 billion above our pre-pandemic level in the fourth quarter of '19. Shareholders' equity increased $5 billion from the third quarter as earnings and AOCI improvement were only partially offset by capital distributed to shareholders. The AOCI improved $4 billion, reflecting both the previously mentioned BSBY-related reclassification into fourth quarter earnings and other AOCI improvements. This included some improvements in other cash-flow hedges, which don't impact regulatory capital, driven by a decline in long-end rates. During the quarter, we paid out $1.9 billion in common dividends and we bought back $800 million in shares, which more than offset our employee awards. Tangible book value per share is up 3% linked-quarter and 12% year-over-year. Turning to the regulatory capital, our CET1 level improved to $195 billion from September 30th, while the CET1 ratio declined 9 basis points to 11.8% and remains well above our current 10% requirement as of January 1st '24. We also remained well-positioned against the proposed capital rules, as our current CET1 level matches our 10% minimum against anticipated RWA inflation from the proposed rules. Risk-weighted assets increased $19 billion on loan growth and growth in global markets, RWA, and our supplemental leverage ratio was 6.1% versus the minimum requirement of 5%, which leaves plenty of capacity for balance sheet growth and our TLAC ratio remains comfortably above requirements. So let's focus on loans by looking at the average balances on Slide 7. And you can see loan growth improved this quarter as we saw improvement in both credit card and commercial borrowing, offset by declines in commercial real estate and securities-based lending. The commercial growth reflects good demand overall and was muted only at quarter-end by companies paying down commercial balances as they finalized their year-end financial positions. Lastly, on a positive note, we've seen loan spreads continue to widen, given some of the capital pressures from proposed rules on the banking industry, and this combined with investments in relationship managers we've added over the past few years, has positioned us to take market-share and improved spreads. Moving to deposits, I'll stay focused on averages on Slide 8, and the trends of ending balances saw growth in Global Banking and wealth management and declines in consumer. Relative to the pre-pandemic fourth quarter '19 period, average deposits are still up 35%. Every line of business remains well above their pre-pandemic levels. Consumer is up 33%, with checking up 40% driven by the net-new checking accounts added that Brian noted earlier. On a more recent performance basis, deposits grew $29 billion or 6% from Q3 on an annualized basis. The only business that saw a decline in deposits linked-quarter was consumer. And here we saw a decline of $21 billion. This linked-quarter decline slowed from the third quarter change. And in total, we have $959 billion in high-quality consumer deposits, which remains $239 billion above pre-pandemic levels. The total rate paid on consumer deposits in the quarter was 47 basis points and this remains very low, driven by the high mix of quality transactional accounts. Most of this quarter's rate increase remains concentrated in CDs and consumer investment deposits, which together only represent 15% of the consumer deposits. Turning to wealth management, balances on an end-of-period basis improved modestly, and we continued to experience a slowing in the trend of clients moving money from lower-yielding sweep accounts into higher-yielding preferred deposits and off-balance sheet. Our sweep balances were down $4 billion and were replaced by new account generation and deepening. Global Banking deposits grew $23 billion, moving nicely above the $500 billion level that we've experienced over the course of the past six quarters. These deposits are generally transactional deposits of our commercial customers. They are the ones that used to manage their cash flows. And noninterest-bearing deposits were about 33% of deposits at the end of that quarter. So when we turn to excess deposit levels on Slide 9, you can see deposit growth exceeded loan growth this quarter. And that expanded our excess of deposits above loans, from Q3 to about $0.9 trillion, which is well above the $0.5 trillion we had pre-pandemic. You can see that in the upper-left of Slide 9, which is where we've used and shown you how we think about managing excess liquidity. We continue to have a balanced mix of cash available-for-sale securities and held-to-maturity securities. And this quarter, the combination of the cash and the AFS securities now represent 51% of the total $1.2 trillion noted on this page. You'll also notice the change in mix of the shorter-term portfolio as we began to lower cash and increase available-for-sale securities buying mostly short-dated T-Bills with similar yields. You can note also the hold-to-maturity book continued to decline from paydowns and maturities pulling to PAR. In total, the hold-to-maturity book moved below $600 billion this quarter. It's now down $89 billion from its peak and it consists of about $122 billion in treasuries and about $465 billion in mortgage-backed securities along with a few billion others. Also note that the blended cash and securities yield continued to rise and remained about 170 basis points above the rate we pay for deposits. The replacement of these lower earning assets into higher yielding assets continues to provide an ongoing benefit and support to NII. From a valuation perspective, given the reduced balance and the longer-term interest-rate reductions we've seen in the fourth quarter, we experienced an improvement of more than $30 billion in the valuation of the hold-to-maturity securities. So, let's turn our focus to NII performance using Slide 10. And a strong finish to the year helped us report $57.5 billion in NII on a fully tax-equivalent basis for the full year of 2023. That's up 9% compared to 2022. On an FTE basis, we reported $14.1 billion in NII, which was modestly better than we told you to expect last quarter driven by modestly better deposit growth. The $14.1 billion was a decline of $400 million from the third quarter, driven by the unfavorable impacts of deposits and related pricing and lower global markets NII, partially offset by higher rates benefiting asset yields. And as we look forward, given that we've got one less day of interest in the first quarter and that's worth about $125 million to $150 million, and given the rate curve shift, we believe the first quarter will be somewhere between $100 million and $200 million lower than the fourth quarter. It could move a touch lower in Q2 and then we believe it should begin to grow sequentially in the second half of 2024. So very consistent with our prior guidance. With regard to the forward view I just provided, let me note a few other caveats. It would include an assumption that interest rates in the forward curve materialize. And the forward curve today has six cuts compared to last quarter when we had three cuts in the 2024 curve. So it's bouncing around a little and shifted in the past quarter. Forward view also includes our expectation of low to mid-single-digit loan growth and some moderate growth in deposits as we move into the back half of 2024. Given our recent deposit and loan performance, we continue to feel good about these assumptions. Before moving away, it's worth noting our net interest yield declined 14 basis points to 197 basis points. And that's driven by the decline in NII, as well as higher average earning assets, reflecting prior period builds of cash and cash-like securities. Turning to asset sensitivity and focusing on a forward yield curve basis, the plus 100 basis point parallel shift at December 31st was $3.5 billion of expected NII over the next 12 months, coming from our banking book. And that assumes no expected change in balance sheet levels or mix relative to our baseline forecast, and 93% of that sensitivity is driven by short rates. The 100 basis point down scenario is $3.1 billion. Let's turn to expense and we'll use Slide 11 for the discussion. And we reported $15.6 billion in adjusted expense this quarter, which excludes the FDIC assessment. This was in line with our projection from last quarter and down $199 million from the third quarter, driven by reductions in headcount earlier in the year and seasonally lower revenue-related expense. These reductions outpace the continued investments that we're making to drive growth. Our average headcount was down from the third quarter to 213,000 people, and that's good work after peaking at 218,000 last January. We lowered our headcount through the year by 5,000 and did so without taking an outsized severance charge as we used attrition to lower our headcount along the way. One more point to acknowledge the good work of our teams on expense, Q4 '23 adjusted expense of $15.6 billion is only $94 million higher than the fourth quarter of '22. And just remember, we began 2023 with a $125 million lift in quarterly FDIC expense. So through some good operational excellence work and otherwise, we've managed through all of the additional costs of investments in new tech initiatives and merit and financial center openings, as well as some stronger revenue and higher marketing costs. As we look forward to next quarter, we expect to see the more typical Q1 seasonal elevation in expense of $700 million to $800 million compared to Q4. So we believe expense will be around $16.4 billion in the first quarter. That includes elevated payroll tax expense and the expected costs of higher revenue in both sales and trading and wealth management, as well as merit cost increases. And as we move through 2024, we expect the quarterly expense to decline from Q1, reflecting a drop in the elevated payroll tax expense and revenue changes, as well as some additional operational excellence initiative work. Continued digital transformation and adoption is also going to help us as we go through the year. Now turn to credit, and I'll use Slide 12 for that. Provision expense was $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter and it included an $88 million reserve release due to a modestly improved macroeconomic environment. On a weighted basis, we're reserved for an unemployment rate of nearly 5% by the end of 2024 compared to the most recent 3.7% rate reported. Net charge-offs of $1.2 billion increased $261 million from the third quarter, and the net charge-off ratio was 45 basis points, a 10 basis point increase from the third quarter. On Slide 13, we highlight the credit quality metrics for both our consumer and commercial portfolios, and the overall increase in net charge-offs was driven by three things. First, $104 million of the increase was driven by credit card losses, which continued to normalize as higher late-stage delinquencies flowed through to charge-offs. Second, $65 million of the increase was driven by a broad range of smaller commercial and industrial losses, which were mostly previously reserved and monitored for the past couple of quarters. And lastly, $76 million of the increase was driven by commercial real estate losses, primarily due to office, also mostly reserved. In the appendix, we've included a current view of our commercial real estate and office portfolio stats provided last quarter, and we've also included the historical perspective of our loan book de-risking and long term trend of our consumer and commercial net charge-offs, and you can see those on slides 30 to 33. Let's move on to the various lines of business and their results and I'll start on Slide 14 with Consumer Banking. For the quarter, consumer earned $2.8 billion on continued good organic growth and despite their good client activity, it's difficult to outrun the earnings impact of higher rates on deposit costs while the credit is also normalizing. The reported earnings declined 23% year-over-year as top line revenue declined 4% while expense rose 3% and the credit costs rose. Customer activity showed another strong quarter of net new checking growth, another strong period of card opening and investment balances for consumer clients which climbed $105 billion over the past year to a record $424 billion. Our full year flows were $49 billion as accounts grew 10% in the past 12 months. Loan growth was led by credit card and that broke above $100 billion this quarter. Deposit decline slowed in the quarter with continued strong discipline around pricing. And our expense reflects continued business investments for growth. And as you can also see on the appendix page 21, digital engagement continued to improve and showed good year-over-year improvement as customers enjoy the continuation of enhanced capabilities. Moving to Wealth Management on Slide 15. We produced good results, earning a little more than $1 billion after adding 40,000 net new relationships in Merrill and the private bank this year. These results were down from last year as a decline in NII from higher deposit costs still catching up from the interest rate hikes, more than offset higher fees from asset management, driven by higher market levels and assets under management flows. As Brian noted earlier, both Merrill and the private bank continued to see strong organic growth and produced solid assets under management flows of $52 billion since the fourth quarter of '22, which reflects a good mix of new client money as well as existing clients putting their money to the work. Expenses reflect continued investments in the business and revenue related costs. On Slide 16, you see the global banking results. The business produced strong results with earnings of $2.5 billion as a decline from peak levels of NII was offset by lower provision expense, leaving earnings down 3% year-over-year. Revenue declined 8%, driven by the NII. Our global treasury services business remained robust with strong business from existing clients as well as good new client generation. In addition, we continued to see a steady volume of solar and wind investment projects this quarter and our investment banking business continued to perform well in a sluggish environment. Year-over-year revenue growth also benefited from lower marks on leveraged loan positions. The company's overall investment banking fees were $1.1 billion in Q4. That grew 7% over the prior year despite a fee pool that was down 8%. And for the year we held on to the number three position overall, given that performance. In the component parts, we ended the year number one in investment grade, number two in leverage finance, number four in equity capital markets, and number four in mergers and acquisition. The diversification of the revenue across products and regions reflects the growing strength of our platform, and a good example of that is our focus on the equity capital markets blocks business, where we finished number one in the United States for the first time since 1998. And in EMEA, we were also number one for blocks. Provision expense reflected a reserve release of $399 million and that comes from an improved macroeconomic outlook as well as realized charge-offs better, as noted before. Expense decreased 2% year-over-year as continued investments in the business were more than offset by reductions in other operating costs. Switching to Global Markets on Slide 17, the team had another strong quarter, with earnings growing 13% year-over-year to $736 million, driven by revenue growth of 4% and we refer to results excluding DVA as we normally do. Good results in sales and trading and comparatively low remarks on leverage loan positions drove the year-over-year performance and focusing on the sales and trading ex-DVA, revenue improved 1% year-over-year to $3.8 billion, which is a new fourth quarter record for the firm. FICC was down 6% from a record quarter, while equities increased 12% compared to the fourth quarter of '22. And the FICC revenues were down versus that record fourth quarter level with higher revenues in mortgages and municipal trading. Equities was driven by improved trading performance in derivatives. And our expense was up 3% on continued investment in the business. Finally, on Slide 18, all other shows a loss of $3.8 billion, as the two notable items highlighted earlier negatively impacted net income by $2.8 billion in that segment. Revenue adjusted for the $1.6 billion BSBY cessation was flat year-over-year, and expense adjusted for the $2.1 billion FDIC assessment was down a couple hundred million, driven by lower litigation and lower unemployment processing costs. I noted earlier we reported a modest tax benefit this quarter. The tax credits from tax advantaged investment deals throughout the year, including their benefits in the fourth quarter, exceeded taxes on reported earnings because we had the two notable items that lowered results this quarter. For the full year, our tax rate was a little more than 6%. And excluding the impacts of BSBY cessation and FDIC and the other discrete tax benefits, that rate was 10%. And further excluding our investment tax credits, our tax rate would have been 25%. So thank you. And with that, we'll launch into the Q&A, please. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Jim Mitchell of Seaport Global. Jim Mitchell : Hey, good morning, guys. Alastair, maybe on the NII trajectory that you're talking about, sort of down a little bit in the first half and then start to stabilize in the second half, and you're building in six cuts, but a lot of those cuts are coming starting in sort of 2Q and beyond. And given your asset sensitivity, why would we expect NII to stabilize? Is that just sort of expected growth of deposits and loans? Just kind of help us think through your assumptions on the NII for '24. Alastair Borthwick : Yeah. Well, I think, Jim, going back to last quarter, I don't think our views have changed a great deal. So our guidance isn't changing much either in that regard, if anything, Q4 deposits were a little better than we expected. So I think, you see and -- we sort of thought this quarter might be around $14 billion. It was a little better than that. So that's obviously a good starting point. Now, when we look forward off of that slightly higher number, if you think about Q1, I'm thinking about it in terms of a date count, that might be $150 million, let's say. So from where we are, that's going to get us to somewhere between $13.9 billion and $14 billion. It's going to be in that kind of a range. Q2, we see going down just a little bit more. That's a little bit of deposit seasonality in Q1 and a little bit of just catch up on rate paid and some rotation. But at that point, we see growing in the back half of the year, and that's largely, yes, deposits growing, it's loans growing a little bit, it's some restriking of the securities that come off the balance sheet, and it's restriking some of the loans that come off the balance sheet. So it's all of those things. You're right. When we got together last quarter, we thought there might be three rate cuts. Now it's up to six. So that's obviously a -- that's a little harder but the deposit picture has been a little better. So no particular change at this point. Jim Mitchell : Okay, that's fair. And maybe just as a follow-up, just on loan growth, what do you think -- we all see the card growth, but outside of that, it's been pretty muted. We're looking at rate cuts. Maybe that's a little bit better for demand. How do you think -- what are you seeing on the commercial side in terms of demand and what changes the dynamic? Alastair Borthwick : Well, I mean, you look back, if you look at our loan growth in the materials, it's been a pretty slow loan growth environment. And I think what's going on underneath it is, obviously, you've got the economic activity. Offsetting that a little bit is lower revolver utilization. And you can start to see why with rates being much higher, it's a little more expensive to borrow a revolver. So as corporate cash balances have come up and deposits have come up, that's just a natural headwind. That's beginning to fade. So we kind of feel like the loan growth ought to be low single digits. Normally, we think about it is kind of GDP plus just a little bit of market share. So in a low GDP environment, that's sort of what we're expecting for loans this year. And then we'll just need to see how the rate structure develops. Jim Mitchell : Okay. All fair. Thanks. Operator : We'll take our next question from Erika Najarian of UBS. Please, Najarian, please check your mute switch. Your line is open. Erika Najarian : Hi, sorry. Rookie move. Apologize for that. Alastair, if you could -- thank you for giving us more detail about how your NII trajectory is going to be for the rest of the year. I'm wondering if you could just give us a little bit more color on what you're expecting for deposit rate repricing and perhaps for BofA specifically, perhaps the liability mix in the second half of the year. So if you expect deposit growth to come back, I think a big question that the market has is, what is the repricing power to the downside that these banks have as the Fed cuts rate? So I think that would be really good color for the market to have. Alastair Borthwick : Yeah, okay. So, first of all, if I go back over the trajectory of deposits through the course of 2023, we troughed at [$1.845 trillion and we ended at $1.925 trillion] (ph). So underneath there, there's $80 billion of growth in deposits since May. So that obviously informs our perspective around how we think about deposit gathering at this stage. That feels to us like it's a supportive environment of our NII forecast. Second, obviously, over the course of this year, there's been a move towards more interest bearing. And that actually helps us in the event that we start seeing Fed cuts, because that's obviously going to allow us to take those rates down. So, look, we're going to see a little bit of rotation, I think, here in Q1 and Q2. I think we'll likely see a little bit of deposit pricing lag. But the last Fed hike at this point was July. So there's been an awful lot of time at this point for deposit pricing to shake out. We won't be immune from anything. We have to compete for deposits along with everyone else. But combine all of those things and that's where we get our confidence. Erika Najarian : Got it. And just to clarify how we should think about the full year, the $16.4 billion in 1Q '24 expenses and a quarterly decline from there, does that pretty much square with what you've said in the past for expenses of up 1% to 2% year-over-year? And would that number include an assumption that investment banking activity returns in force in 2024? Brian Moynihan : Yeah, so we -- If you think about it, pre-pandemic, we reached a point where we've taken the expenses down a place where we said we'd kind of grow at sort of half the rate of inflation, et cetera. So you're right. It -- what we're thinking now is we're up $100 million in the fourth quarter of last year's fourth quarter. And if you think about that is -- and you look at the personnel side of it, it's up a little higher and non-personnel is down a little lower. We got the rise in first quarter expenses, then we start going down each quarter again. So if you think about $100 million to $200 million of sort of inflationary growth over the quarters this year, you get between [$64 million and $64.5 million] (ph). And most of the firms out that we look at are sort of in that range and we feel comfortable with that. But that sort of allows us the room to use our good operational excellence, take out expenses and replace them with things like revenue-related expenses that we've seen. And we see that pattern reemerge now as we gotten stability and past the pandemic and past the great resignation and all the inflation that occurred in that -- in the '21/'22 time frame, we now stabilize back to that ability to produce sequential declines in quarters during the year -- year-over-year growth of inflationary 1% to 2% levels. And that gets you in that low 64s. Erika Najarian : Thank you, Brian. Operator : We'll take our next question from John McDonald of Autonomous Research. John McDonald : Hi, Alastair, Brian. Alastair, I wanted to go back on the NII and maybe you could help us. It's so hard for us to square the NII outlook with the rate sensitivity disclosure that you have in the slide with the 100 basis point parallel shift down is $3.1 billion. Maybe just, is there some caveats about how in the real world it doesn't play out like the disclosures? We've already seen rates come down on the long end, almost 100 basis points. So I guess it just -- where's that $3.1 billion headwind in your number? Because it's very impressive, obviously, to be able to kind of keep it flat despite that, using the forward curve. Thanks. Alastair Borthwick : Yeah, well, I mean, I think that the main thing is, number one, it obviously assumes a parallel shift instantly. So -- the rate cuts that are in the forward projections, the earliest one comes March, for example. So you're not going to see a full year's worth of rate cuts all in the space of the first day or so. It doesn't work out that way. So, John, I think the way to start would be just use what we've disclosed, which is that $3.1 billion. You can see what we say in terms of how much of that is the short end. And then I just take that number and use that as the beginning point. And just keep in mind, we still see some deposit growth, some loan growth, and some securities and loan repricing that offsets all that. John McDonald : Okay. Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe just on top of that, trading NII or the global markets NII, is that likely to be a headwind or a tailwind in '24 versus '23? Is that -- do you have any visibility on that? Alastair Borthwick : Yeah. Well, look, if you look at global markets, in any given quarter, it moves around just based on the customer behavior. But over the long arc, if you look over the course of the past two or three years, it's liability sensitive. So I'd expect if you see rate cuts that'll benefit global markets NII just a little bit. And you can almost like -- if you think about just retracing the steps of what they've conceded in NII, you'd sort of expect to get that back over time. John McDonald : Okay. So maybe that could grow a bit. Brian Moynihan : John, this quarter was a drop, third quarter, fourth quarter, a pretty good amount. And so -- and that's partly due to the fourth quarter being lower activity, just lower inventory carry and things like that. That reversed itself and we're off to a good start so far in the first quarter here and the balance sheet moves back up. So there's a little bit of quarter-to-quarter linkage third to fourth quarter typically. John McDonald : Okay, got it. Thanks, guys. Operator : We'll take our next question from Mike Mayo of Wells Fargo. Mike Mayo : Hi. Just another follow-up on NII. I guess if you take the Fed dot plot, maybe there's just three rate cuts. If you take that instead of the six, what would -- how would you be thinking about NII change? Alastair Borthwick : I think if we got the three rather than the six, Mike, we'd do modestly better, I think. Let me put it this way. If we hadn't seen the three more since last quarter, we might have a higher guide, but -- because we've come off of a base with better deposit gathering in Q4, so we're starting in a better place. So those two things have sort of evened themselves out. But obviously, if it pushes out later, that's a good thing for us. Mike Mayo : Brian, Alastair, you always talk about the information advantage you have by just being in the flow of so much of the US economy. What do you think, I mean, is this -- and not relying -- I know you like relying on your research group, Brian, and what their economic forecast is, but what do you guys think as far as, are we going into a recession the second half this year? Does the Fed need to cut six times? Are you seeing that? Where are you seeing the most softness, I guess, is the question. Brian Moynihan : So I think our research team has rate cuts in next year and has a soft landing, as you referenced, Mike. So that's it. As you see the customers today, as I said earlier, the year-to-year spending growth in the fourth quarter versus last year's fourth quarter, or in the first quarter so far, versus the first part of last year is a 4% to 5% rate in movement of money. And that was across $4 trillion plus out of the consumer accounts in Bank of America into the economy. That 4% to 5% is similar to what it was in '17, '18, '19 when the Fed rose -- took rates up, inflation was under control and economy was growing at 2% -- 1.5%, 2%, 2.5%. And so the spending level should sustain an economy, albeit our core prediction is it's slowing down from a higher growth rate in the third quarter, 4.5%, 5%, whatever it was, down to a percent or something like that in the first couple of quarters next year. But we see the consumer activity indicating that they're still in the game, they're still spending money. Where they spend, it's a little different, more in services and going out in restaurants and experiences and less on goods at retail. They're employed. If you look at the estimates by any of you -- any of your economists, the unemployment rate projected is really a modest deterioration from here, most of them in the core base case, our reserves actually set at almost a 5% unemployment rate by the end of this year, to give you a sense. So that's good news. They're using their credit responsibly. Much is made of higher credit card balances, but on the size of the economy, and the size -- people are forgetting that economy is a lot bigger than it was in '19 because of the inflation, everything. And as a percentage, we don't see any stress there. We see a normalization of that credit. So they're working. They're getting paid. They have balances in their accounts. They have access to credit. They've locked in good rates on their mortgages and they're employed. It's -- we feel it's good. So we think the soft landing is a core thesis. And our internal data supports what our research team sees. And they get -- they see it also through our institute. Mike Mayo : And then just as far as controlling what you can control in terms of expenses and headcount, tech investments, and maybe throw in AI as part of that, what sort of extra efficiencies can you achieve through AI, tech, and other initiatives? You squeezed a lot out over the last decade plus. What's left to go? Brian Moynihan : Yeah, there's always more to go. So if you -- I think we've got lined up. If you take what we're doing this year and next year, meaning '24, '25 and enrolled in '26, it's a couple of billion dollars plus, which helps us to the dynamic Erika was talking about avoiding growth and expenses, keeping below inflation. Because you think of us as rolling that expense taken out back into good things. This year will be, I think, $3.8 billion on technology initiatives. That's up from '21 to '22 by $500 million or more and then sort of flattish '22 to '23. They're being applied in different ways. We added relationship managers across the board. We keep opening the branches. We're largely through the rehab of the branches that we're keeping. And these are all spending to grow. And that's what you're seeing. So net new checking account, 600,000 for the year. That's 20 straight quarters of net checking account growth. All good core accounts flows into the asset manager business, $80 billion or more. In our Merrill Edge program, the advertising has driven the business. We have 10% more customers. And those customers, which is 300,000 to 400,000 customers added in the last 12 months, those customers bring an average opening balance of $80,000 to $100,000. To give you a sense, they're not small accounts, that's good. So we're just investing. But there's a thousand levers. None of them are simple. But even this year, when we said we got to get the headcount growth back in alliance after the great resignation in '22 and we had to hire fast, we went from 218,000 people in January down to 212,900 at the end of the year. And in that, we're rolling over teammates from one business to another business where we need help and retraining people and reskilling people. And as AI comes in and to the extent that we can deploy it, deploy it wisely, it'll allow us to redeploy people. And even with our very low turnover rate, which is 7% for year '23 and actually down from 12% in the year '22 and I think 6% in the fourth quarter, we still can manage headcount down just by not hiring people, because that gives us an opportunity. We hired 15,000 people this year. So we hire -- we can always hire a little less if we see the efficiencies coming through and redeploy the people we have. Mike Mayo : All right. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank. Matt O\u2019Connor: Hi. Just thoughts on capital allocation from here. Brian, I think there were some -- and sorry if I missed it in the beginning, but I think there was some media coverage about you guys, are you talking about leading into markets with capital? I don't know if there's any way to kind of size that. And then just broadly speaking, like how you allocate capital from here or buyback levels and all that stuff? Thanks. Brian Moynihan : Yeah. I'm not sure of the media report, but in the end of the day, Jim DeMare and team have done a great job to deploying capital and growing market share in the sales and trading business. So they're up 7% year-over-year in revenue. FICC was up 11% for the year. Equity was down a little bit, down 1% or so. And they've done a great job. $17.6 billion of revenue, highest by a lot -- over the last few years. And think about it, in the '19 time frame, we were $13 billion in revenues. They fundamentally moved up. That was deploying more balance sheet, you got a little bit more capital but inherently, but not a lot. They're not taking a lot of risk. They made money every trading day in '23, again, I think. And so they do a great job of serving the clients. So don't think there's a big capital, a massive amount of capital. They get the capital they need. They have the balance sheet and the risk appetite they need. But we're continuing to put money towards that business because they've proven to be successful. We gave them the balance sheet a few years ago and they were able to deploy. More broadly, we pay out the dividend. We then have a bunch of capital. Today we meet the standards as best. As Alastair said, we could divine from the rule, and we'll see what the final rule looks like when it comes out. But right now, the $194 billion of CET1 is the level of notional CET1. We have to meet the RWA inflation. I'm not saying it's a good rule. I'm just saying we make the math work. And so from now on, we can basically deploy capital to the dividend payment, a couple of billion dollars a quarter, and then everything above that will go to support business growth if we have it, build a little bit of cushion, we need to build over some period of time to meet these new rules if they come through, and then share buybacks, which we bought $800 million or so last quarter, and you'd expect that to keep ticking up. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay, that's helpful. And then you did mention that trading or markets is off to a good start so far this year. Obviously, just a handful of days, but any color around that? And then kind of more broadly speaking, as we think about the overall wallet, like, obviously banking is the press, but how would you frame the market trading wallet? Do we use 2020 as a jumping off point and grow it by some kind of long term trend or any way to kind of frame that in terms of a base case? Thank you. Alastair Borthwick : Yeah, it's too early for us to predict what the quarter will look like. We'll get a much better feel for that four, five, six weeks from now. But I think you can use the '23 numbers as a baseline starting point. And then the first quarter, I just applied sort of a typical kind of seasonality. Q1 tends to be a very good quarter for us, Q4 less so just with the client activity. And then just recognize that we're starting from a Q4 record. So that's the only thing I would consider. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay, thank you very much. Brian Moynihan : And then actually you mentioned investment banking. Matthew and the team exceeded what we thought in the quarter and seemed to perform better than industry. And actually we're up a little bit year-over-year, but there's a full pipeline. The question is sort of when is the clarity? And you're seeing some stuff get done. And with stability in rates, you'd expect that to kick back up. We typically are running about $1.5 billion before the added activity because of the rate falling and pandemic a quarter. We're now billion $1 billion, $1.2 billion. You expect it to move back in those levels. And we have actually been gaining share over the last few quarters as the markets gone down around as we held our relative position and grew it. So I think Matthew and the team is in good shape and this middle market execution has added a lot of throughput to the team and is building up over time. Operator : We'll take our next question from Glenn Schorr of Evercore. Glenn Schorr : Hello, there. Good morning. First question is on the deposits. And I like the path that we've seen in terms of all the stimulus comes, all the deposits come in, you get some spending, you get some migration, you get some rich people buying treasuries. It's great. To see the stability in the fourth quarter and hear your comments about 2024 for deposits is a little encouraging. We'd always want more, but it's a little encouraging. But my question is, to be 35% higher in 4Q '19 is what I would call a lot more growth than a normal period of time would be with the up and down. So is that a good thing or is that a risk? And maybe the answer lies within how much of those excess deposits are sitting in all these new accounts that you've opened versus just cash from sitting around in existing clients that's maybe waiting to be deployed. I hope that question is clear. Brian Moynihan : Yeah. So, Glenn, you're making me have deja vu, because basically, I think you would have asked this question in the first quarter of '23 [too] (ph), on a theory that this was all going to run off. And so when we looked at it, we always said, we had grown sort of in the period up of time, the pandemic at sort of 4%, 5% a year in terms of deposit growth. If you strung that line out, that -- we're still above that line. Let's just say that. And now we're turning and growing. So as Alistair said, we troughed in the middle of the year. So we've outgrown what our sort of implied growth rate would have been against size, et cetera. So we feel good about that. It's all core. Now, if you look at the online dynamics, think about the different clients we have. If you start with the wealth management clients discreetly in GWIM, those balances came down and are bouncing around $300 billion -- $290 billion, $300 billion on a given day. And they've been relatively stable now for, I don't know, five, six months, I think. If you look at the wholesale banking, what's happened is they came -- they've shot up, came down after the pandemic, and then they've been growing back and they're actually stronger because just the activity is picked up and the stabilization of line usage has -- shows that the environment around their borrowing and cash is more consistent. So that's been good. And if you look at consumer, that's what we were saying earlier. If you think about consumer, where you see, if you take the people had accounts with this -- their balances in all their deposit accounts pre-pandemic to now, if you look at people had in consumer, not in wealth management, $50,000, $100,000, $250,000, $1 million in collected balances pre-pandemic, they are down 20%. They move the money, they're going to move. And so for wealth management and consumer, largely people who are going to move money out to get rates have done that and -- is there -- is it still bouncing around a little bit in consumer? Yeah, they're $950 billion more or less on a given day. But it's stabilized and been relatively consistent for the last four, six, eight weeks. But that's got to settle in and then you grow out from there. But that -- what that's really telling you is they've kind of moved the money they're going to move, mostly because they did it and you don't get that money twice. So you moved a chunk in these higher end consumer balances. They moved 20% of their balances over in to get in money market funds, which we captured into other things. And they don't have it to move again because that was accumulated balances that they had in a zero interest rate environment, pre-pandemic, plus whatever other things they got. So if you look at the Slide 8, you can see this deposit slides laid out by non-interest bearing and interest bearing. But the key is that consumer with [$700 billion going into the pandemic, sits at $950 billion] (ph) today. And if you look at the checking, it's still up $140 billion, and that's kind of bouncing around. You can see it's moved down a little bit, but that's really the high -- people with high end checking balances that have moved it into the market. Glenn Schorr : That's all good and more than I was looking for. I appreciate it. The quickie follow-up on reserves now. As you mentioned... Brian Moynihan : Just one back -- look at the Consumer Banking page. It's 47 basis points all in, and it was six quarters ago. And so -- and that's all driven by the CDs. We don\u2019t have a lot of CDs and some of the high end money market pricing. But the point is, if it was going to be moved, it's -- think about that. It's -- so the money that's moved is moved and we pay higher rates for very high balances and stuff like that, so -- especially in like the Merrill Edge platform. So a lot of that dynamic is through the system right now, for lack of better term. Glenn Schorr : That was great. Good comment. I appreciate that. Quickly on reserves is, with a pretty solid economy, resilient US consumer, your NPLs are down. You have a lot of reserves. The question is, what are the signposts that you or we should be looking for to know when you've added enough, when we're stable enough, point in time and you actually start funding charge-offs from reserves and not adding? Thanks. Alastair Borthwick : I think we're getting pretty close now because things are beginning to stabilize. They're beginning to normalize. The whole -- this is a period of transition for the economy and it's a period of transition for our clients, too. A lot of them are dealing with higher interest rates and they're just beginning to moderate and change their spending behaviors. So we've seen a trend over the course of the past few quarters. It's pretty predictable around the consumer side. You can see that in our disclosures. I think it's slide 12 and 13, but that's going to bounce around over the course of the next couple of quarters. Now that we're back towards 2018-2019 levels, it's going to settle in, we think, in the first half of this year. And then on the commercial side, the asset quality remains really in a very good position. We happen to have a couple of names that popped up this quarter, but to your point, we were pretty fully reserved against them. That wasn't a surprise to us. We had seen those for the course of the past six months. So we think we're getting close there, Glenn. And obviously, the closer we get to a soft landing, the better we're going to feel about that. Brian Moynihan : Glenn, as you think about it, when you said reserves, remember, because under CECL and stuff, we've always got sort of the lifetime reserve methodology, which we're all still getting clear now. We've operated under for a few years, but this quarter we actually had commercial reserves come down to pay for the charge-off on a specifically prior period, reserved properties or loans, and that happened. And so you saw some of that. Be careful on the consumer side because basically the pay-as-you-go side, the consumer side is still building up to a nominal amount of charge-offs, consistent where it was in '18/'19. So if you look at card in '18/'19, the charge-off rate across the eight quarters ranged from a low of 2.90% to higher 3.26%. We're at 3.07% today, but we're $6 billion, $8 billion higher balances. So you got to be careful the nominal amount to get that right. If you go look at it more broadly, all -- the company, we had a 45 basis points this quarter, and the range in those eight quarters are [34 basis points to 43 basis points] (ph). But what's different is the CRE piece of that and a charge-off. So the reserve to loans and all the classic factors looked at are very strong. The reserve has set itself with basically half the reserve is driven by the adverse case scenario, to give you a sense, versus the base case, and then some judgmental on top of that. And so as it becomes clear that we're in a soft landing, to Alastair's point, there's less allocation to those scenarios. We always will make some. But when you put all that together and wait, it has unemployment pushing up in the high 4s, and you look at unemployment today, it's nowhere close to that, and there's no prediction to get there in a base case. So that's what will start to ease up on the general reserving. But remember, on card it's a bit of pay-as-you-go. And we were running around 6% reserves. We're up to 7% against card now. So there might be a little bit coming back, but not that -- I'd rather have the growth to sop that up down to 6% in cards than give them back to reserves. Glenn Schorr : That's great color. Thank you for all that. Operator : We'll take our next question from Ken Usdin of Jefferies. Ken Usdin : Hey, thanks. Good afternoon. Just a technical clarification on that BSBY $1.6 billion. So I presume that you start to get that back mid quarter 4Q next year, given the November 15, 2024 termination, and then does it just run out ratably? Just wondering how -- over what exact period of time you get that $1.6 billion. Brian Moynihan : Okay. Hey, Ken, Happy New Year. It -- this year's \u201824, so. Ken Usdin : Correct, sorry. Alastair Borthwick : Ken. Yes, you got it right. We'll get some of it back at the back end of 2024. So we'll get a little bit in the fourth quarter, and then I'd say we get most of it back in '25, most of the remainder back in '26. That's the easiest way to think about it. Ken Usdin : So it's a little -- so is it straight line or is it a little bit front load, like, I just want to get -- is just a straight line divided by or it has a little bit of like a tail? Alastair Borthwick : No, it's got a little more in 2025 than 2026. Ken Usdin : Okay, I got it. Thank you. And just one question. Can you just remind us of brokerage fees this quarter felt the impact, I think you said it of the soft averages from this quarter. And so I think should we expect to see just from the markets bounce that we saw in the fourth quarter, that to play well into the first quarter starting points from the management fees perspective? Alastair Borthwick : Yeah. I think you should expect our global markets performance to continue right now. I mean, obviously, there's a pretty constructive environment for the markets business at this point. I don't think anything has changed there. There's a lot of client repositioning going on. So, yeah, I think the fourth quarter is sort of the right number to start with. And then you've just got to, I think, adjust for the fact that obviously, you've got a step up in their activity in Q1. If you -- I don't know if I misinterpreted, if you're talking about the wealth management. Ken Usdin : Yes. Alastair Borthwick : Then those fees are obviously just going to work on the monthly lag based on where the markets go over time. So obviously the markets are elevated right now, and that should [pretend] (ph) well, for the future. Ken Usdin : That's what I was getting at. Thank you. Right. Just confirming that we didn't see the benefit yet. That comes further based on the averages and how that'll play forward, presuming the market hangs in there. Alastair Borthwick : Correct. That tends to be a lag by a month or so. So you'll see that in Q1. Ken Usdin : Okay, got it. Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Ryan Kenny of Morgan Stanley. Ryan Kenny : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Just following up on a few questions ago on the commercial credit side. So the commercial net charge-offs did roughly double sequentially. And you mentioned that there were a few customers that popped up. Should we interpret that to mean that the pace of deterioration decelerates and it was just a one-off, or is there anything else going on under the hood there? Alastair Borthwick : Yeah, so I don't think -- let me put it this way, I think it's too early to conclude that it's anything other than just a momentary spike-up. But if you look at that chart, essentially what's going on is two things. First, we've got a little bit of office, and that's going to bounce around over the course of time. It just takes a while to resolve that portfolio. It's pretty small for us, obviously. We feel like we're doing all the right things with it, but that was a little elevated this quarter relative to the prior three. And then more broadly in commercial, there were a couple of other things that took place this quarter. Again, we were pretty fully reserved against them. So we sort of saw those coming. Asset quality generally in commercial remains in a very, very good place outside of the office sector. And you can again see that in terms of -- look at our reserve will criticize that declined this quarter. So I don't think there's any change there. The issue is just that we're starting with such small numbers in commercial that anything appears like a spike. Ryan Kenny : Thanks. And then just one more clarifying question on NII. So in this scenario with the six rate cuts, can you help us understand how you expect the deposit mix to migrate? And specifically, would the migration from NIP to IP deposits grind to a halt? Or is there any scenario where NIP deposits actually start growing again? Alastair Borthwick : Well, I think what we're trying to describe is a sense that we're getting towards the tail end of this now, partly because we're now six months away from the last time that the fed raised rates, and then partly because if we do have rate cuts, it's going to start to disincent people moving out of non-interest bearing. So. that's what we're describing over the course of time. We've got to see how that develops through the course of the year. Ryan Kenny : Thanks. Operator : We'll take our final question from Gerard Cassidy of RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Hi, Brian. Hi, Alistair. You guys have obviously done a very good job in the consumer banking area with digital banking, and I frame that for you guys in this question. We hear a lot about AI and what it could do for the banking industry. And when you look out over the next three to five years and you invest in AI to improve efficiencies, could it have a similar impact what digital banking did for consumer banking pre-iPhone to where we are today in your business? Or is it going to be more like blockchain, where it was a lot of discussion about the future of blockchain, but we don't hear much about that anymore? Do you guys have a view on what AI could be for your business over the next three to five years? Brian Moynihan : I'm not -- I agree with you. I'm not sure that there's a relevant comparison to blockchain, but let's just focus on AI. If you look at '21, you can see the digital movement. One of the things in the digital movement you see is Erica in the lower left-hand page -- lower left-hand chart on Page 21, Gerard, and you can see that in the fourth quarter, the 170 million interactions with Erica, where people effectively answered on question another 2 million people from last year to this year using it on a basis, 16 million up to 18 million people using it, unique users. And that's just an example. And that's AI in an early stage. We built that starting ten years ago. It operates on our data, use natural language processing. We have to keep updating that for the way people use words, that process. But think 170 million phone calls, walks into branches, emails, et cetera, where that inquiry had -- would have to go through another place and it's able our clients to do things and find them. So we think that there's vast promise for AI and we're deploying it in places, a lot of internal stuff. We help employees work better, work faster. We're doing it. We have it in our coding shop. There's coders using it to continue to improve their effectiveness in learning it. But it's still -- there's still the care that has to be taken on data and usage and models and accountability. It's -- all that stuff is still high. So we're using for things that are a little easier and we think it has great promise. It's just going to -- I'd say it's going to be more similar to digital. What the pace will be, it'll be a little bit of how far it can go before you start to run into difficulties, applying it effectively. But it plays off of the same thing that we've done in digital and Erica and other things. We brought Erica over to the commercial side now, so that -- CashPro uses Erica to answer questions and we're seeing the uses of that grow and you can see the customers can interface and be comfortable with it, and that's good. So it will have tremendous help as it's applied in more and more ways. We are still trying to hear and seeing if it really works, how much benefit it generates. Can it be controlled under the model outputs controlled, and also the things. But we've had algorithmic machine learning type models all over our company for years. And so the billions we've spent literally over the last ten years on data -- cleanliness data, or getting the data in the right place, making sure it's dependable, and the models [operate or either under] (ph) that aren't -- these open at -- open autonomous natural language models, but are models that are machine learning models. We've seen great promise. That's partly how we operate the company now, basically on the same dollar amount of expenses we had in 2015 or '16, to give you a sense. So yes, it's been digitization, but it's also been using more than that. So it's got -- we have high hopes for it. We just have to make sure it does a great job for the customer. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And as a follow-up, we've been reading and seeing a lot of information about the private credit markets making inroads, continue -- and we know the shadow banking industry has been around for a long time, our entire careers. What are you guys seeing today? Is it more competitive against the Apollos and Blackstones in lending? And then second, they're also, I'm assuming customers are yours, so how do you balance servicing them? But at the same time they could be a direct competitor in the lending markets. Brian Moynihan : Well, that's all the issues that we got to balance on a given day. And we can originate loans into their platforms and there are lots of things we can do. So we continue to work through that. I think to take it more broadly, my colleagues and I have made clear that the strictures around our industry, the methodology operating and the openness and ability to operate outside has led to the mortgage business largely being done outside the industry and most other asset classes for lack of better term. Being outside the industry and the private lending is just another case of that. And I think we're very competitive. We do a great job. We have a $0.5 trillion of consumer, excuse me, commercial loans outstanding. We have hundreds of billions of dollars of mid-sized companies, et cetera. So we think there's a way that we can do this with our clients and help them and help us. A lot of them are asking can you help us originate loans? I think there's still a question ahead of whether the policy of having more things going on the bank industry is a good policy. Of course, we in the banking industry don't think it's a good policy because the reality, I think, one inherent part of your question was when these companies bounce around because of economic stress or for them as an operator, the banking system has a workout methodology, not a liquidation methodology or trading methodology. And that served American enterprise very well. And so I think we have to be clear and see how it affects the economy that way. And those are issues that were true pre-pandemic and have become more acute. So we feel we'll be competitive no matter what. Nothing scares us. We've got a great team and they do a great job. But it's endemic of the issue that if you keep pushing too much capital regulation, stuff will find its way outside the system. And that doesn't mean the risk has changed, it just means it's moved from purview of the regulators and that's one of the points we make. But on the other hand, we are working with those enterprises to help us be a combined effective competitor. Gerard Cassidy : Very good, Brian. I appreciate it. Operator : This does conclude our question-and-answer session. I'd be happy to return the call to Mr. Brian Moynihan for closing comments. Brian Moynihan : Happy New Year to everyone. Thank you for all the time today and on a very busy day with lots of us reporting. As we summarized, fourth quarter was a good quarter and another strong year for our company driven by organic growth from all our customer segments. Our digital capabilities continue to grow, our deposits and loans grew, and that's good news. Our NII continues to exceed what we tell you each quarter in terms of what we think is going to happen, which is good news. We gave you new guidance which we plan to hit. Our capital markets activity remains good on both the investment banking side and the sales trading side. And importantly, to get the value of that revenue, we have to have good expense management. You saw us, during the course of year take headcount down from 218,000 to 212,900. You saw us take the expense down sequentially, sets us up good for next year. And with all that, our capital and asset quality remains strong, as does our liquidity. So thank you and we look forward to talking to you next quarter. Operator : This does conclude today's Bank of America earnings announcement. You may now disconnect your lines, and everyone have a great day.",

Later you will have the opportunity to ask questions during the question and answer session. You may register to ask a question at any time by pressing the star and one on your telephone keypad. You may withdraw yourself from the queue by pressing the pound key. Please note this call may be recorded. I\u2019ll be standing by if you should need any assistance. It is my pleasure to turn the conference over to Lee McIntyre, Bank of America. Lee McIntyre : Good morning. Thank you Liam. Welcome and thank you for joining the call to review our first quarter results. Our earnings release documents are available on the Investor Relations section of the bankofamerica.com website, and that includes the earnings presentation that we will be referring to during the call. I trust that everyone\u2019s had a chance to review the documents. I\u2019m going to first turn the call over to our CEO, Brian Moynihan, for some opening comments before Alastair Borthwick, our CFO discusses the details of the quarter. Before they begin, let me just remind you we may make forward-looking statements and refer to non-GAAP financial measures during the call. Forward-looking statements are based on management\u2019s current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause our actual results to materially differ from expectations are detailed in our earnings materials and our SEC filings that are available on our website. Information about non-GAAP financial measures, including the reconciliations to U.S. GAAP, can also be found in our earnings materials that are available on the website. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to you, Brian. Thanks. Brian Moynihan : Thank you Lee, and good morning to all of you, and thank you for joining us. I am starting on Slide 2 of the earnings presentation. We once again delivered a strong set of results in quarter one. We reported net income of $6.7 billion after tax and EPS of $0.76. This included the additional expense accrual for the industry special assessment by the FDIC to recover losses from the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. This lowered our quarter one EPS by $0.07. Excluding that expense, net income was $7.2 billion and EPS was $0.83 per share in quarter one. Alastair is going to walk you through details of the quarter momentarily, but first let me give you a few thoughts on our performance. We delivered good improvement in our fee-based business, driven both by continued organic growth and good market conditions. Investment banking saw a nice rebound this quarter. We delivered nearly $1.6 billion in investment banking fees and grew 35% from the first quarter 2023. Matthew Koder and the team have done a great job delivering market share growth. In addition, our results reflect the benefits of investments made in our middle market investment banking teams and dual coverage teams. Matthew has utilized [indiscernible] power wisely to grow our middle market team from 15 bankers in 2018 across a dozen cities, to more than 200 bankers in twice as many cities today. Both groups work with our commercial bankers and wealth management advisors in those cities to deliver for our clients. Investment and brokerage services revenue across Merrill and the private bank grew 11% year-over-year in quarter one to nearly $3.6 billion. Continued investments in our advisor training programs and digital delivery for our clients as well as positive market helped us deliver strong revenue. Asset under management flows were $25 billion in the quarter. Sales and trading excluding DBA delivered its eighth consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue improvement. At $5.2 billion, this is the highest first quarter result in over a decade. We have allocated more balance sheet invested in talent to build our [indiscernible] for the last five years in this business. Those investments plus the intensity of the teams under Jimmy DeMare\u2019s leadership have resulted in good momentum and market share improvement. From a balance sheet perspective, we entered the quarter expecting modest moves in loan growth and a decline in deposits - those were our expectations. What we actually delivered was growth in ending deposits of more than $20 billion. Ending loans were down modestly due to the expected credit card seasonality, otherwise loans were pretty stable. This balance sheet performance along with our continued pricing discipline allowed us to deliver better than expected NII performance. We told you last quarter that we expected NII to decline from the fourth quarter of 2023 to the first quarter of 2024, a decline of about $100 million to $200 million. We actually reported today NII of $14.2 billion - that was $100 million higher than quarter four, exceeding our guidance. We continue to deliver strong expense management. Year-over-year expenses adjusted for the FDIC assessment was up a little less than 2% - that compares to the 4%-plus inflation rate. We also continued to invest in our company while managing those expenses. We had several categories with stronger fee-based revenue in the first quarter this year. This drove higher formulaic compensation and processing costs of the increased activity. Fees and commissions were up 10% year-over-year. We are happy to pay for that revenue and deliver more earnings to the bottom line because of it. How did we do all that and hold expenses under the inflation rate? Well, we remain focused on three primary drivers at Bank of America. First, our operational excellence platform continues to deliver and improve processes. These savings from that growth help fund the future growth in the company and lower the risk. Second, we managed headcount as we eliminated work. Recall, we noted an expectation in January of last year that our headcount would be down throughout the year. Our headcount at the end of first quarter 2024 was down by more than 4,700 people from the first quarter 2023. It declined 650 people just from the end of 2023. The digitization activity is also driving ongoing expense cost savings, customer retention and market share improvement, driving across all three factors. It also supports the ever-increasing volumes of client activity with little increased cost. I would highlight our continued capital strength with common equity Tier 1 capital of $197 billion. That amount of capital is $31 billion over the current regulatory minimums for our company. That capital has allowed us to both support our clients and return $4.4 billion to shareholders this quarter in share repurchases and dividends. Let me highlight a few points on our organic growth before I pass it over to Alastair. Now I\u2019m turning to Slide 3. You can see on Slide 3 the highlights of quarter one successful organic activity across the businesses. We continue to invest and enhance our digital platforms. We provide our customers with convenient and secure banking experiences. By leveraging our technology and continuous investment in that technology and putting customers at the center of everything we do, we have successfully deepened our relationships and expanded our customer base across all our businesses. In consumer, we had added 245,000 net new checking accounts this quarter. This completes 21 straight quarters of net additions. Dean Athanasia, Aron Levine and Holly O\u2019Neill helped drive that business for us and continue to perform well, driving strong performance across our consumer franchise. These checking balances continue to drive the performance of our consumer deposits. These checking additions are important for many other reasons. On average, 68% of our deposit balances have been with us for more than 10 years; 92% of the customer checking accounts are primary checking accounts in the household, meaning that they\u2019re the core operating account for the household for their financial lives. When we on-board a client, we start a long-term valuable relationship. About 60% of our checking accounts customers use a debit card and on average they do about 400 transactions per year on that card. The new checking accounts have traditionally opened savings accounts, about 25% of the time within a few months of opening that checking account. Opening a new checking account on average brings about $4,000 in balances below our averages, but that continues to grow and within a year, it\u2019s two times that amount. Likewise when we open a new savings account, it on average brings about $7,000 in balances. This also deepens by about two times during the year. Investment relationships and credit card account openings continued to be strong in the first quarter as well. While we believe some of these statistics are best in class, rest assured there are plenty opportunities for further growth in our franchise and our company. As we think about our global wealth team led by Eric Schimpf, Lindsay Hans and Katy Knox, that team added 7,300 net new wealth relationships with Merrill and the private bank. Our advisors opened 29,000 new bank accounts in the quarter with our customers, deepening their relationships. More than 60% are investing clients in Merrill and 90% of our private banking clients now have a core banking relationship with us. In addition, across our wealth spectrum we saw $60 billion in total flows over the last year. As you can see on this slide, we now manage more than $5.6 trillion in total client balances across loans, deposits and investments, and consumer and wealth management. When we move to global banking, we added more new relationships in this quarter than we did in last year\u2019s first quarter. We also increased the number of solutions per relationship with preexisting clients. Just like in our consumer business, we have seen good growth in customers seeking the benefits of both our physical and our online capabilities and also the care of our talented relationship managers, who provide financing solutions and advice for our clients with global needs. A couple other points I\u2019d make on our digital success. Erica, our virtual banking assistant, reached a key milestone of more than 2 billion interactions since its introduction about six years ago. It took four years to reach 1 billion interactions; it took just 18 months to reach the second billion. In August, we extended Erica\u2019s reach and launched Erica in our global treasury services business and CashPro. Erica has resolved 43% of the CashPro chat inquiries automatedly, demonstrating more and more clients are able to self-solve. This is a great example of best practices being shared across the scale of our company. Second, as an example of our digital success, Zelle continues to grow. It wasn\u2019t long ago that we noted that the number of Zelle transactions in a quarter had surpassed the number of checks written. Shortly after that, Zelle transactions reached two times the number of checks written. This quarter, Zelle transactions have now passed the combined number of checks written plus the amount of cash withdrawals from tellers and from ATMs. That is a rapid adoption and represents continued cost savings and convenience and security for the customers. These stats and others are included in our quarterly activity for our digital banking progress. That\u2019s included in Slides 20, 22 and 24. I encourage you to read them. They show our market-leading efforts representing billions of dollars of our investment over the years, and we are continuing to drive growth with expense growth under control. The solid earnings results achieved this quarter are a testament to the dedication and talent of our 212,000 people who work here and deliver for our customers every day. I thank them for another great quarter. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Alastair. Alastair Borthwick : Thank you Brian. I\u2019m going to start on Slide 4 of the earnings presentation. Brian covered much of the income statement highlights and he noted the difference in our reported results and the results adjusted for the FDIC assessment, so I\u2019m not going to repeat that; I\u2019d just add that we delivered strong returns. On a reported basis, our return on average assets was 83 basis points, and return on tangible common equity was 12.7%. When adjusted for the FDIC assessment, our efficiency ratio was 64%, ROA at 89 basis points, and ROTCE at 14%. Let\u2019s move to the balance sheet on Slide 5, where we ended the quarter at $3.27 trillion of total assets, up $94 billion from the fourth quarter, and the bulk of that increase was in global markets to support seasonally elevated levels of client activity. Outside of the global markets activity, we\u2019d highlight both the $23 billion growth in deposits and the $20 billion decline in cash levels. With that increase in liquidity, you\u2019ll also note that debt securities increased $39 billion, which included an $8 billion decline in hold-to-maturity securities and a $47 billion increase in AFS securities. Those are mostly hedged U.S. treasuries added with yields effectively at cash rates. At $313 billion, our absolute cash levels remain higher than required. Liquidity remains strong with $909 billion of global liquidity sources, and that\u2019s up $12 billion from the fourth quarter and remains $333 billion above our pre-pandemic fourth quarter \u201919 level. Shareholder equity increased $1.9 billion [indiscernible] earnings, as they were only partially offset by capital distributed to shareholders, and AOCI was little changed in the quarter. During the quarter, we paid out $1.9 billion in common dividends and we bought back $2.5 billion in shares, which more than offset our employee awards. As part of those share awards in the first quarter, we announced our seventh consecutive year of share and success compensation awards, covering more than 95% of our associates and further aligning their interests with shareholders. Tangible book value per share of $24.79 is up 9% year-over-year. Looking at regulatory capital, our CET-1 level improved to $197 billion from December 31, and the CET-1 ratio was stable at 11.8% and remained well above our current 10% requirement. We also remain quite well positioned against the current proposed capital rules as our CET-1 level is also above the 10% requirement even when we include estimated RWA inflation from those new proposed rules. Risk-weighted assets increased modestly, driven by client activity in global markets, and our supplemental leverage ratio was 6% compared to a minimum requirement of 5%, which leaves capacity for balance sheet growth. At $475 billion of total loss absorbing capital, our TLAC ratio remains comfortably above our requirements. Let\u2019s turn our balance sheet focus to loans by looking at the average balances in Slide 6. Average loans in the first quarter of $1.048 trillion were flat compared to the fourth quarter, and they improved 1% year-over-year as solid credit card growth was partially offset by declines in securities-based lending. Commercial loans grew modestly year-over-year. We experienced modest improvement in revolver utilization in commercial lending in the first quarter, and that\u2019s being offset for the most part by pay downs as larger client financing solutions are being met through capital markets access. Lastly on a positive note, loan spreads continued to widen. Moving to deposits, we\u2019ll stay focused on averages on Slide 7, and relative to pre-pandemic Q4 2019, average deposits are still up 35%. Every line of business remains well above their pre-pandemic levels and consumer is up 32%, with checking up 38% driven by net new checking accounts added, as Brian noted earlier. Linked quarter total average deposits remained steady at more than $1.9 trillion. The total rate paid on consumer deposits in the quarter was 55 basis points, and while the rate increased nine basis points from the fourth quarter, the pace of increases continues to slow. The mix of low rate and high quality transactional accounts keeps the rate paid low. Wealth management and global banking also saw a slowdown in the increases in their rate paid and slowdown in the rotation out of non-interest bearing accounts in the first quarter. Focusing for a moment on ending deposits and movement from the fourth quarter, this quarter we delivered good deposit growth. Total deposits grew $23 billion and are now $100 billion above their trough in mid-May of 2023. Consumer banking deposits saw growth in both consumer interest-bearing and non-interest bearing. Global banking continued their more normal pattern of deposits seen for the past five quarters and up more than $30 billion over the last year. Deposit growth exceeded loan growth for the third straight quarter and our excess of deposits over loans expanded to $897 billion, and that\u2019s nearly two times the $450 billion we had pre-pandemic. You can see that on the upper left-hand side of Slide 8. We continue to have a mix of cash, available-for-sale securities and held-to-maturity securities, and this quarter our combination of cash and AFS is now 52% of the total $1.2 trillion noted on this page. You\u2019ll also notice the continued change in mix of the shorter term portfolio as we again lower cash and increase AFS securities that are mostly hedged and at similar yields to the cash. Note also the hold-to-maturity book continues to decline from pay downs. In total, the hold-to-maturity book is now down $96 billion from its peak and consists of about $122 billion in treasuries and about $458 billion in mortgage-backed securities, along with $7 billion of other securities. Lastly, a blended cash and securities yield of 360 basis points continued to rise and remained about 168 basis points above the rate we paid for deposits. The replacement of lower earning assets into higher yielding assets continues to provide an ongoing benefit to NII. Let\u2019s turn our focus to NII performance using Slide 9, where you can see on a fully tax-equivalent basis NII was $14.2 billion. Good deposit growth provided a strong start to the year for NII, and as Brian noted, NII of $14.2 billion increased by $100 million from the fourth quarter. That compares to our expectation and guidance of a decline of $100 million to $200 million, and that would have resulted in NII this quarter of $13.9 billion to $14 billion, so we did quite a bit better than we had originally expected. The improvement in quarterly NII in Q1 compared to Q4 included the benefits of higher yielding assets and improvement in global markets NII, partially offset by higher deposit cots and one less day in Q1 than 4Q23. Deposit balance activity more generally also aided in the beat versus our expectations. As we look forward for Q2, we expect some modest impact of lower deposits in wealth management as client make their seasonal income tax payments, and we expect global markets NII to decline mostly seasonally a little bit as well, so we expect second quarter NII could approach $14 billion on an FTE basis. Further, we continue to expect that Q2 will be the low point for NII and we expect the back half of 2024 to grow. Compared to our guidance last quarter, we\u2019re obviously growing off a larger base of NII after having outperformed in the first quarter. With regard to that forward view, let me just note a few other caveats. It includes our assumption that interest rates in the forward curve at the end of the quarter materialize, and at the end of first quarter there were still three cuts expected this year, starting in June. Our forward view also includes an expectation of low single-digit loan growth and some moderate growth in deposits as we move into the back half of 2024. Given our recent deposit and loan performance, we continue to feel good about these assumptions. Turning to asset sensitivity and focused on a forward yield curve basis, our sensitivity to the plus and minus-100 basis points parallel shift in the forward curve at March 31 remains well balance. Let\u2019s turn to expense, and we\u2019ll use Slide 10 for that discussion, where we reported $17.2 billion expense this quarter including the FDIC assessment. Adjusted for the assessment, expenses were $16.5 billion and the increase over the fourth quarter included a little more than $400 million in seasonal payroll tax expense, as well as higher revenue-related costs and, to a lesser extent, annual merit increases and other annual awards, like sharing success awards provided this quarter. $16.5 billion was just a little above our forecast for Q1 which we made last quarter, and the increase is driven by better than expected fee revenue across wealth management, investment banking, and sales and trading, and as Brian said, that\u2019s a trade-off we\u2019re more than happy to make, bringing more earnings to the bottom line. While expense is up almost 2% from last year, we simply remind you inflation is up by more than 4% and we\u2019ve increased our investment, and we\u2019re paying for the revenue growth, so we think it represents good work by our teams. As we look forward in Q2, we expect a decline from the Q1 level as we typically see about two-thirds of the Q1 elevate payroll tax expense come back out, and the remainder of the year expense is expected to trend down. Continued digital engagement savings and operational excellent initiatives should help us offset other cost increases for people and technology through the back half of the year. Turning to credit on Slide 11, provision expense was $1.3 billion in the first quarter, and that included $179 million of reserve release due to a modestly improved macro environment outlook as the baseline consensus expectations improved from the fourth quarter. On a weighted basis, we remain reserved for an unemployment rate of nearly 5% by the end of 2025 compared to the most recent actual 3.8% rate. Net charge-offs of $1.5 billion increased $306 million from the fourth quarter, driven by continued credit card seasoning and commercial real estate office exposures as swift revaluations from current appraisals and resolutions drove higher charge-offs. The net charge-off ratio was 58 basis points, a 13 basis point increase from the fourth quarter. On Slide 12, we show you the credit quality metrics for both our consumer and commercial portfolios. Consumer net charge-offs increased $150 million versus the fourth quarter from the flow-through of higher late stage credit card delinquencies. We included a credit card delinquency slide, No. 28 in our appendix, and we\u2019re encouraged by the trend of delinquencies because the late stage increases slowed and early stage delinquencies improved as well, and that leads us to believe we should begin to see consumer net charge-offs start to level out over the next quarter or so. All of this is still well within our risk appetite and our expectations, and it\u2019s consistent with the normalization of credit we discussed with you in prior calls. Commercial net charge-offs increased $191 million versus the fourth quarter, driven by commercial real estate losses and office exposures. On office losses this quarter, we recorded charge-offs on 16 office loans. Four were a result of sales activity, i.e. final resolution, seven were from losses that we expect on exposures that are in the process of expected resolution in the course of the next 90 days, and the rest we took as a result of refreshed valuations. We use a continuous and thorough loan-by-loan analysis and we\u2019re quick to recognize impacts in the commercial real estate office space through our risk ratings, and that\u2019s resulted in several downgrades in the last few quarters. As a result of these quick actions and our downgrades in categorization, we\u2019ve also refreshed the valuation of our reservable criticized properties, and we\u2019ve taken appropriate reserves and charge-offs in the process. Roughly one-third of our office exposure is now categorized as reservable criticized, and importantly the pace of the increase in reservable criticized exposures has slowed each quarter since the second quarter of last year, so we believe the losses on these office properties have been front-loaded and largely reserved. We expect the losses to move lower in the second quarter and we expect a notable decline in the second half of the year when compared to the first half of this year, absent any material change in expected real estate prices. In the appendix on Slide 29, we\u2019ve included a current view of our commercial real estate and office portfolio metrics, as we usually do. Let\u2019s turn to the various lines of business and offer some brief comments on their results, starting on Slide 13 with consumer banking. For the quarter, consumer banking earned $2.7 billion on continued strong organic growth. The reported earnings declined 15% year-over-year as revenue declined from lower deposit balances compared to the first quarter of \u201923. Credit card loss normalization also caused year-over-year provision expense to increase. As Brian noted, customer activity showed another strong quarter of net new checking growth, another strong period of card openings, and investment balances for consumer clients which climbed 29% year-over-year to a record $456 billion. That included market appreciation and also very strong full-year flows of $44 billion. As noted earlier, loans grew nicely year-over-year from credit card as well as small business, where we remain the industry leader. Expenses were flat year-over-year, fighting off inflation, merit increases, higher minimum wages, and new and renovated financial centers and technology investments, so holding expense flat reflected very good work by the consumer team. As you can see on the appendix, Page 20, digital adoption and engagement continued to improve, reaching a record of $3.4 billion digital log-ins in the quarter, and it showed good year-over-year improvement. Customer satisfaction scores at near record levels illustrate the continued appreciation of the enhanced capabilities we provide. Moving to wealth management on Slide 14, we produced good results, and that included good organic client activity, market favorability and strong flows. Our comprehensive suite of investment and advisory services coupled with a commitment to personalized wealth management planning and solutions has enabled us to meet the diverse needs and aspirations of our clients. In first quarter, we reported record revenue of $5.6 billion and a little more than $1 billion in net income. That net income was 10% from the first quarter of \u201923. The business generated positive operating leverage and grew revenue faster than expense, while improving the pre-tax margin year-over-year. While overall average loans were down year-over-year, driven by the securities-based lending, it\u2019s worth noting the strong growth we\u2019re seeing in custom lending, and ending loans in the wealth management custom loan book are up 6% year-over-year. As Brian noted earlier, both Merrill and the private bank continued to see strong organic growth and produce good assets under management flows of more than $60 billion since the first quarter of \u201923, which reflects a good mix of new client money, as well as existing clients putting money to work. Expense growth here matched the revenue growth, otherwise fighting off higher investment costs and inflation. Let me also highlight the continued digital momentum here. As an example, Merrill has 86% of its clients now engaging with us digitally and 80% utilizing e-delivery. 76% of their eligible accounts are now opened digitally, so the cost for us to open is half and the customer cycle times are improved greatly. On Slide 15, you\u2019ll see our global banking results, and the business produced earnings of just less than $2 billion, down 22% year-over-year as improved investment banking fees and treasury services revenue were overcome by lower net interest income and higher provision expense. Revenue declined 4% driven by the impact of interest rates and deposit rotation to interest-bearing, and that impacted NII. The diversification of our revenue across products and regions continues to reflect the strength in this platform, and GTS and investment banking fees are good examples. In our global treasury services business, some of the NII pressure from higher rates on deposits is offset by the fees paid for moving and managing the cash of clients, and that continues to grow with existing clients as well as with new client generation. As Brian noted, investment banking had a strong quarter, and at $1.6 billion in investment banking fees, this quarter was the strongest quarter in seven years, absent the pandemic 2020 and 2021 periods. An increase in provision expense included the commercial real estate net charge-offs I discussed earlier, as well as a larger reserve release in the prior year period. Expense increased 2% year-over-year, including the 35% lift in investment banking fees from the first quarter of \u201923. Switching to global markets on Slide 16, we\u2019ll focus our comments on results excluding DVA, as we normally do. The team had another terrific quarter with $1.8 billion in earnings, growing 7% year-over-year. Revenue improved 6% from the first quarter of \u201923 and return on average allocated capital was 16%. Focusing on sales and trading ex-DVA, revenue improved 2% year-over-year to $5.2 billion, which is the highest first quarter result in over a decade. FICC was down 4% while equities increased 15% compared to the first quarter of \u201923. The decline in the FICC revenues versus the first quarter was driven by a weaker macro trading quarter that was partially offset by better mortgage trading results. Equities was driven by strong trading results in derivatives, and year-over-year expenses were up 4% from continued investment in the business. Finally on Slide 17, all other shows a loss of $700 million driven by the FDIC assessment. Revenue declined year-over-year, reflecting higher investment tax credit yields, and expense adjusted for the FDIC assessment was down $133 million, driven by lower unemployment processing costs. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 8%, and excluding the FDIC assessment and other discrete items, it would have been 9%. Further excluding tax credits related to investments in renewable energy and affordable housing, our effective tax rate would have been 26%. Thank you, and with that, we\u2019ll jump into Q&A. Operator : [Operator instructions] We\u2019ll take our first question from Steven Chubak of Wolfe Research. Steven Chubak : Hey, good morning. Alastair Borthwick : Good morning Steven. Steven Chubak : Maybe just to start off with a question on capital management, just given the strength of your excess capital position, maybe still some uncertainty around Basel III end game and where the proposal could ultimately shake out, I was hoping you could just speak to where you\u2019re comfortable running on CET-1 and when can we expect that you\u2019ll return to 100%-plus type payout. Brian Moynihan : I think you should expect, so if we run a cushion, whatever rules come out and when they come out and get clarity, we\u2019ll expect to run the requirements plus 50 basis points, up to 100 basis points of excess, and anything above that will be either used to continue to grow the company, if needed; if not, it will be returned. We\u2019re just, as all of us are, waiting for the finalization of these rules. Right now, we\u2019re sitting on $30 billion under the old rules. We have enough under the new rules as previously proposed, but obviously they\u2019re talking about changing them, so you should expect clarity on that. What you\u2019d also expect is as we think about it, beginning now, you\u2019re basically at the point where you\u2019re sitting on the capital with a very modest need to build a cushion to the rules as proposed, and any changes will be more favorable to that, I assume, so expect us to continue to return capital at a fairly strong rate as we move through the second quarter and beyond, and the rules become clarified. Steven Chubak : Great color, Brian. For my follow-up, just on the NII commentary, Alastair, it sounds like you\u2019re still assuming some modest deposit growth in the back half as part of that NII trajectory, that recovery off the trough in Q2. Just given your deposit balances increased $500 billion since COVID, I know some of that is going to be a function of share gains, but as we prepare for some QT driven outflows, how are you handicapping the risk of the deposit attrition and how does that impact the NII guidance? If you can frame any sort of sensitivity, recognizing many of those tend to be high money or higher cost deposits. Alastair Borthwick : Yes, so first thing I\u2019ll just say, Steven, is we\u2019ve been up against QT now for the last couple of years, so the deposits are beginning to settle in now. If we were to go back to--if you take, for example, consumer, if you were to go back to pre-pandemic and think about what long term sustainable growth rates looked like for consumer, if you just extended that through from the fourth quarter of 2019 to today, given that the economy is 30% larger, we kind of feel like consumer is approaching that floor, so we\u2019re still in this belief that Q2 is going to be--Q3 may be the turning point for consumer. You can see that slowing now. The rest of our business, if you look at the exhibit we put together on deposits, if you look at that bottom left chart on wealth, you\u2019ll see it slowed and grew this quarter. Then in global banking on the right-hand side of that page, they\u2019re kind of back to pre-pandemic growth rates - they\u2019re up 7% year-over-year, so we\u2019re seeing some structure now in the deposit base even with QT over the course of the past year. Our deposits are up $100 billion, so it has been a point of conviction of ours that as we get towards Q2, we should see the consumer side begin to stabilize. That\u2019s what\u2019s driving our conviction that NII will go up in Q3 and Q4. We\u2019re in that transition period right now. Steven Chubak : Good color. Thanks so much for taking my questions. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Mike Mayo of Wells Fargo. Mike Mayo : Hi. Thanks for the outlook for NII and the consumer charge-offs, but once again I go back to efficiency. You highlight the 2 billion Erica interactions, the last billion the last 18 months. You mentioned Zelle transactions now double the check transactions, or more than checks plus cash withdrawals from ATMs plus cash withdrawals from tellers, so for all the great tech work, the efficiency ratio improved 66% to 64% quarter-over-quarter, but I know you\u2019re still not happy with that 64%. As you see the NII decline in sight and as you have this tech evolution continuing, when do you think you can get below a 60% efficiency ratio? What\u2019s your outlook for that, because I\u2019m just reconciling the numbers that we look at with all the progress you\u2019re making internally. Thanks. Brian Moynihan : Mike, I think as NII moves along the path that Alastair mentioned, all that sort of flows through because there\u2019s no more activity attached, as you\u2019re pointing out, namely continuing to reduce marginal expense of that activity because largely that\u2019s consumer, wealth management and global banking, which don\u2019t add lots more clients and stuff and lots more activity, even though the numbers go up out of efficiency, so that\u2019s continuing to improve our efficiency ratio. As you also well know, when the revenue growth is coming through the wealth management business, which by definition because of the way the compensation process works, has a lowest efficiency ratio in the company, that\u2019s a good thing because it grows and we get good profitability growth out of it. But we\u2019re fighting that trend, and as one of the largest wealth management businesses in the world, if not--you know, it\u2019s a higher percentage of our revenues in our expense base, and so we\u2019re continuing to drive it down. We\u2019re at 64, you\u2019d expect that to improve as the deposit balance is stabilized for many quarters now and starting to grow. The rate paid has really flattened out sequentially by quarter, and the yield of the portfolio and the yield of the assets continues to grow, so we feel good about how it\u2019s going. Our focus is really on deploying expenses in operating leverage, and as we get through the twist in NII, you should start to see us return to that again, and that would then obviously drive down the efficiency ratio. Mike Mayo : But what are you thinking about expense growth for the rest of the year or next year? I get it - inflation has gone up quite a bit, but what are your thoughts about expense growth looking ahead? Alastair Borthwick : Well last year, remember Mike, we told you we thought we could drive expense down every quarter. We believe this year, the expense will trend down over the course of this year, and obviously Q1 is inflated a little bit with just payroll tax and some of the revenue seasonality, but underneath that there\u2019s pretty significant revenue strength, so I think that probably cost us $100 million or so this quarter. I think we probably are looking--you know, if this environment continues, we\u2019re looking at another $100 million per quarter going forward, but it\u2019s--to Brian\u2019s point, it\u2019s the good expense that comes with revenue growth over time. That\u2019s really the only change I\u2019d say with respect to how we think about the expense picture. Mike Mayo : All right, thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from John McDonald of Autonomous Research. John McDonald : Thanks, good morning. Wanted to follow up on the helpful deposit commentary. Alastair, you mentioned the consumer, you\u2019re thinking that that will stabilize in the back half of the year on deposits. I\u2019m wondering what your mix shift expectations are - you know, earlier this year, you kind of thought that those customers that moved for rate seeking already had, and just wondering if higher rates for longer could put some pressure on rate-seeking behavior again, and what you\u2019re baking in, in terms of mix shift from non-interest bearing into interest-bearing in your outlook and your planning. Brian Moynihan : John, I think if you look at Slide 7, you can see the mix in the left-hand corner. Remember that one of the things we all have to be careful about is in the global banking area, the way the fees are paid and earnings credit, it messes up the simplicity of non-interest bearing and interest-bearing, so it\u2019s complex. But if you look at the quarters coming across from the first quarter of \u201923 through the first quarter of \u201924, you can see that you\u2019re seeing the rate of change slow dramatically and kind of settle in. A lot of the money has moved. If you look at the seven-day average for consumer, going all the way back to the early part of October, it\u2019s been relatively stable at $950 billion, $960 billion, so we\u2019re just getting through the tax season and the ins and outs in the wealth management business and consumer, people paying taxes out on the wealthier side and receiving benefits on the tax refund side, so as we stabilize in that, we expect it to grow. We don\u2019t expect a massive change in how the deposits are structured from what\u2019s in money markets, what\u2019s in savings, what\u2019s in checking and that. It\u2019s really slowed down and been relatively stable, so things jump around but it\u2019s all very good value. Even the highest paid balances in the wealth management business are good value for the company. But if you look at what really drives the value, so the $950 billion-odd in checking balances you can see on Page 7, the core checking balances, that\u2019s what drives it. John McDonald : Are you still feeling, Brian, like the bulk of people that have kind of moved on rate-seeking behavior likely have done so? Brian Moynihan : Yes, if you look on the consumer business and you think about tracking those deposit accounts from pre-pandemic to now, which is one thing we\u2019ve talked about for different purposes, but if you look at where all the deposit balances, if people with lower average balances are still multiples of where they were pre-pandemic, people in the higher balances are actually lower because obviously they were sitting on cash in the pandemic and accumulated more cash, and when rates came up, they moved it. All in, that gives you want you see in consumer, which is at the end of the day a couple hundred million dollars above where it was pre-pandemic. But the people have moved, and you\u2019re seeing it month to month relatively stable as we track that every month on both sides, frankly. The lower average balance accounts from pre-pandemic are basically bouncing around at the same level right now, not going down, not going up, and the higher ones are stable but they are down 15%, 20% for people with a half million, million dollar balances, largely because they moved it in the market, so we feel it\u2019s stabilized. There will be ins and outs and we\u2019ll see it play out, but it\u2019s extremely valuable no matter how you look at it. John McDonald : Okay, and maybe as a quick follow-up for Alastair, it\u2019s nice to see the core NIM, the net interest yield ex-markets inflect positively this quarter. Is that sustainable, do you feel like, and what are some of the fixed asset re-price dynamics that are tailwinds beyond the $10 billion per quarter in securities, in terms of loans and swaps that will come due over the next year or two and help the NIM a bit? Could you talk a little bit about that? Alastair Borthwick : Sure. We\u2019ve talked about the fact that the net interest yield, obviously, this quarter benefits from the NII growth, so you\u2019re getting in the numerator; but we inflated the denominator in terms of the average earning assets last year as we just made the balance sheet more liquid, so that\u2019s going to allow us to continue as deposits grow to grow the net interest income over time without necessarily growing the other earning assets. Q2, we\u2019ll have a little more of a challenge, but going forward I expect all the NII improvement in Q3 and Q4 to drop into that net interest yield, and part of things supporting that, John, as you pointed out, is we do have loans re-pricing. Because we\u2019ve got loans coming off the balance sheet, we\u2019re booking new loans at higher rates, so that\u2019s one element. The second element is we\u2019ve got securities that we\u2019re re-investing underneath all this too, so obviously we\u2019re sweeping the hold-to-maturity pay downs and reinvesting those at much higher rates. Then third, the teams have been working hard at re-pricing the balance sheet broadly for things like loans, and I believe we\u2019ve now had seven quarters in a row of improving loan pricing, so we\u2019ve just got to keep grinding away at that. John McDonald : Thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good morning. Brian Moynihan : Good morning. Betsy Graseck : Thanks very much for taking the question. I guess I just wanted to follow up on the conversation you were just having, and Alastair, I know that--look, your NII guide improved this quarter due to 1Q results being better than what you had anticipated a quarter ago. My question is on the second half \u201924 improvement, I guess it is going to be an improvement from first half, right - that\u2019s basically the base that you\u2019re looking at? I\u2019m wondering how you\u2019re thinking about the NII trajectory on a year-[audio loss]. I believe NII is down about 3% year-on-year in 1Q. Should we anticipate that that is stable pace throughout the year, or that reduces as well when we\u2019re talking about second half \u201924? If you can just give us a sense of year-on-year, that\u2019d be helpful, thanks. Brian Moynihan : Betsy, before Alastair answers your question, it\u2019s good to have you back and wish you good luck with everything. Alastair, why don\u2019t you hit that? Betsy Graseck : Oh, thanks so much, Brian, really appreciate that. Alastair Borthwick : It\u2019s good to have you. I guess a couple things. The first thing is we haven\u2019t changed our perspective in terms of this idea of Q2 being the low point in the trough for the year. We haven\u2019t changed our point of view on growing in terms of Q3 and Q4. I think the important thing we\u2019re trying to convey is because of the continued stability in pricing rotation and because of this continued stability in deposits, we feel like that extra couple hundred million in Q1 is something that should flow through in Q2, Q3 and Q4, and then there will be a second dynamic to watch for as well, Betsy, which is if we have less rate cuts, we\u2019re going to benefit from that. We won\u2019t necessarily benefit a lot in Q2 because there isn\u2019t enough cuts or time in Q2, but I think by the time we get to Q3 and Q4, we\u2019ll know more about the rate structure at that point and we\u2019ll be able to tell you more about what we expect for the growth in the back half of the year, but we\u2019re reasonably optimistic there. Betsy Graseck : Super. That\u2019s perfect, thank you. Then just one follow-up is on the AOCI, so we all know the HTM is a portfolio that you\u2019re in run-off on, I guess, if that\u2019s fair to say, as balances are pulling off, and this quarter we did have a back-up in the long end of the curve, your AOCI really didn\u2019t flex that much. Part of my question is, is that a function of how the securities book is comprised and you\u2019ve been shifting towards treasuries and that\u2019s reducing this risk as the back end of the curve increases. I just wanted to understand how that\u2019s trajecting in your mind, because it is a concern that people raise, and what I saw today suggests that it\u2019s much less of a concern than it had been a year ago, say for example. Would you agree with that? Alastair Borthwick : Yes, I mean, we\u2019ve deliberately worked on that over time, but we\u2019ve always, I think, had a pretty good program of hedging the fixed rate securities in the FS book so that they\u2019re swapped, and that means that if rates go up, we obviously benefit from that. It doesn\u2019t necessarily hurt us in terms of AOCI, so. Most all of the treasuries that you see in our portfolio are swapped, so I would expect very little in the way of AOCI impact there. Betsy Graseck : Thanks so much. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Glenn Schorr of Evercore. Glenn Schorr : Perfect lead-in to this question. On Friday, you talked about AFS securities mostly hedged, your floating rate swaps [indiscernible] less than a half a year. I know the Fed forward curve keeps not being correct, but at some point it\u2019s going to be correct and rates are going to come in. My question is what do you do about that? How much do you think about extending duration and managing your swaps a little differently as we eventually [indiscernible] transition to [indiscernible] rate backdrop? Alastair Borthwick : Yes, so Glenn, ultimately we\u2019ll use the same philosophy and strategy that we do to this point. We are in obviously a very good position where we have substantial deposits in excess of loans - that\u2019s what creates this excess in the top left of Page 8, and it\u2019s what allows us to put everything to work in the top right. The balance that we try to strike, you can sort of see in the left-hand side - we\u2019re trying to make sure that that cash and securities yield compared to the deposit rate paid performs in any environment, so in an environment like this one, where there\u2019s an awful lot going on with rates, we feel like if you look at that spread, I think it was one basis point different quarter-over-quarter, so we\u2019re trying to make sure that we lock in the value, monetize the deposits regardless of whatever the rate environment turns out to be, and we feel like we\u2019re pretty balanced now. We\u2019ve got a pretty good balance of short dated, long dated, fixed and floating that should allow us to perform, whether rates go up or down from here. One final thing I\u2019ll just say, and I think you know this, underneath all of this, obviously we\u2019ve got some securities re-pricing, and to the point, I think it was John asked earlier, we\u2019ve got loans re-pricing as well, and all of that gives a little bit of underlying resilience to this. Glenn Schorr : Yes, I get that. I guess you have a lot of flexibility [indiscernible]. Just one follow-up, you talked deposits to debt. You had a smidgen of year-on-year loan growth, mostly in cards, I think. I know how we got here, but it\u2019s a weird environment - we\u2019re seeing a really strong economy with up markets, and yet no loan growth. Alastair Borthwick : Yes. Glenn Schorr : Is this just any way you slice it, we have to go through another year or two of super low loan growth, or are there any leading indicators that would lead you to believe we can get back to a little bit more normal BofA loan growth and not have to wait two years for it? Alastair Borthwick : Yes, well I think we\u2019re probably getting closer now because, remember, in the big macro, we\u2019re in that transition period where post-pandemic, the economy is sort of recovering and rates are settling in, and it\u2019s changing people\u2019s behavior. We\u2019ve actually got pretty good credit card growth, and that\u2019s just offset by the fact that, for example with securities-based lending at rates that are 5% higher, people are doing less of it; or in commercial, we\u2019ve got some loan growth but the revolver utilization is still suppressed because revolver costs a lot more, so as the Fed has raised rates, it\u2019s changed some of the borrowing patterns of our clients. But that\u2019s not going to last forever because, as you point out, the economy powers through at 3%, 3.5%, whatever it end ups being, loan growth is going to catch up to that over time. For right now, we\u2019re in that transition period, but we\u2019re anticipating that loan growth will pick up at some point in the future, but it\u2019s not an enormous part of our NII guide at this point. Brian Moynihan : And just remember that the capital markets opened up and a lot of the larger clients accessed them as they\u2019ve, frankly, have gotten used to the higher rate structure and need to refinance. If you look across the businesses, you\u2019ve got the commercial [indiscernible]. If you look across the commercial businesses in middle market and business banking, the segment up to $50 million of revenue companies and up to $2.5 billion, they actually saw progress in loan growth. It was really in the high end global corporate investing banking business where you saw sort of pay downs to bring that down. That phenomenon is one that occurs from time to time. It\u2019s probably stabilized now and we\u2019ll see it play out, but we are fighting for loan growth and, frankly, line usage stabilized. It\u2019s better than it\u2019s been for the last few quarters in terms of trend and so again that all speaks to people feeling fine, but they\u2019re not quite as aggressive as they would be when you read the economic statistics, and that\u2019s one of the great debates that you can read about in the paper every day. Glenn Schorr : Thank you both for all that. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Matt O\u2019Connor of Deutsche Bank. Matt O\u2019Connor : Good morning. Obviously there\u2019s been a lot of questions on net interest income and a lot of the color, I guess. Just when you put it all together, when you think about the higher for longer environment, obviously it\u2019s good on the re-investments, you\u2019re trying to max the deposits like you talked about, but how would you just boil it down? You know, the rate disclosure is still [indiscernible] $3 billion kind of exposure to either side is stable--you know, is stable rates for a couple years, is that good or does that accelerate the deposit re-pricing? Just boil that down, thanks. Alastair Borthwick : Sure, well I\u2019d say generally speaking, higher for longer is probably better for banks, as a general statement. The question will become why are rates higher, like what\u2019s going on in the economy? Are we talking about inflation, is it under control, is it coming down? Right now, that appears to be the case, so that\u2019s obviously a good place. The Fed\u2019s in a good place because they appear to have rates that are a real rate that is high enough to make sure that inflation stays in a good place. Things can change, Matt, so an awful lot will depend upon just the why for rates; but generally speaking, if it\u2019s just because it\u2019s taken a little while longer for the inflation to nudge down before the next set of cuts, that\u2019s probably a good environment for us. I would expect us to perform relatively better than we\u2019ve disclosed so far. Then you\u2019re asking a second question, which is around what does the sensitivity look like to plus-100 or minus-100. We\u2019ve tried to just make sure that we continue to stay balanced. If anything, that corridor of plus-100, minus-100 has gotten narrower and narrower over time as we\u2019re trying to lock in NII that\u2019s $4 billion or $5 billion higher per quarter today than it was three years ago, and just make sure that the shareholder benefits from that through the course of time. We\u2019ll see how the environment plays out - it\u2019s only been a quarter since we were last here talking about six cuts. Now it\u2019s three, so we just have to watch this play out and stay patient. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay, fair enough. That\u2019s helpful, thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Ken Usdin of Jefferies. Ken Usdin : Thanks very much, good morning. A real breakout quarter for the IB fee line, and just wondering a couple things within that. One, there was a bit of a back and forth from some of the other banks about whether or not DCM was pulled forward a little bit from future - I wonder what you think about that. But more broadly, you guys have done a good job taking share, what inning do you think you are in terms of not just so much just green shoots but in terms of where that incremental productivity is in terms of getting that IB line to a more permanent higher level? Thanks. Brian Moynihan : If I think about it, if you go back to sort of the period prior to the run-up and the couple years after the pandemic, you\u2019ve had sort of the billion and half type of numbers a quarter. We think we\u2019re fundamentally stronger in the market position, as you said, so we feel very good about the work Matthew and the team have done. As we look at it, we believe that they\u2019ll continue to gain share, and I think this is a more normalized level and whether it\u2019s pulled forward or not, we\u2019ll find out, but it\u2019s a more normalized level given those dynamics and one we should be able to build off of, especially as I said earlier, the penetration in the middle market side of our business, of whether those clients working off our wealth management in the markets generally, plus working across the globe and we\u2019ve done better work international, so we feel good about everything the team\u2019s done, the combination of corporate and investment banking was very strong, so we don\u2019t think this is an unusually high water mark and we should be able to build from here. Ken Usdin : Okay, got it. Then one question about wealth management and just client choices in terms of where they\u2019re sitting relative to earning NII or earning fees. Where do you sense that the cash versus fully invested is in terms of the wealth management brokerage business, and could that turn to the better, turn to the worse depending on how that mix answer goes? Thanks. Alastair Borthwick : Well, wealth management, I think Lindsay, Katy and Eric highlight for us regularly just the elevated levels of cash that our clients have. A lot of that is on us, and you can see that in our deposit chart; but there\u2019s a lot that we captured in the investment area too, where a lot of t heir flows are coming into maybe it\u2019s money market funds, maybe it\u2019s short dated treasuries, but there\u2019s a lot of cash at this point, and so that would tell you it\u2019s supporting the ability to see continued assets under management flows going forward, depending on how obviously the stock market shakes out over time. We\u2019re all struck by just the sheer amount of cash on the sidelines at this point. Ken Usdin : Okay, got it. Thank you. Operator : Once again, that is star, one if you would like to ask a question. One moment while we queue. Once again, that is star, one. We\u2019ll take our next question from Gerard Cassidy of RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Hi Alastair, hi Brian. Brian Moynihan : Hi Gerard. Gerard Cassidy : Alastair, coming back to Slide 8, which is obviously quite impressive on deposits, particularly the upper left-hand graph you presented, when you go back to maybe 2014 or \u201915 and take a look at deposit levels of your company from 2015 to 2019, you just didn\u2019t have the growth that you experienced from the end of \u201919 through today. Can you guys share with us, what drove this meaningful increase in not only excess deposits but all deposits? Brian Moynihan : I think, Gerard, you\u2019ve been around long enough to understand some of those dynamics. As we moved through the post-financial crisis, we had--in terms of that chart, if you looked at it, you had a lot of loans that we\u2019d ran off because they weren\u2019t core loans anymore, and it kind of troughed out at the $900 billion level and then grew out from there. In 2015, that\u2019s when we started driving responsible growth. It was a call to grow now that we\u2019d pushed out a lot of stuff from the financial crisis and got it behind us. The loans then start picking up, but if you remember back then, I think we had almost $300 billion, if I remember right, and if you looked at the slide on loans and the non line of business loans, they were $200 billion or something like that, and it\u2019s down to $10 billion, so think about that dimension. As we ran that down and could grow, we could overcome it, and so then on the growth on loan side, it\u2019s driven by discipline, where we want to play, and the card business is getting it positioned right. Now we can start to push from there, whether it\u2019s on home equity business, on the auto loan business. On the commercial side, it was--we had less issues after the financial crisis in commercial, but kind of getting through all that, it was getting to the credit quality we wanted. A source of great growth for us from 2010 and beyond has been we probably gone from, I don\u2019t know, $20 billion, $30 billion of outstanding loans in the international part of Matthew\u2019s business [indiscernible] to almost $100 billion type of number, so expansion of our international capabilities and downright great credit work by Jeff Green and the team and Bruce Thompson and the team, so put all that together, that\u2019s the loan side. On the deposit side, it really started with a focus that began really prior to--in the middle of the financial crisis and beyond, where we said we\u2019re going to go for core checking accounts in consumer, primary checking accounts, drive customer satisfaction, drive organic growth, and not care about the number of sales as much as the net growth in net sales. As the team, Dee and Thong over time in there, and then Holly now have continued to push that, adding a million-ish net new checking accounts all core, we\u2019ve gone from 60% core to 92%. We\u2019ve got customer satisfaction to the highest levels ever, in the mid-80s, top two [indiscernible], etc., attrition down to lowest ever, preferred rewards kicked in, and all that has led to higher and higher balance retention per account, and then also more accounts. We\u2019ve probably grown in the consumer from, I think, around $300 billion at the beginning of 2010, 2011 to now $900 billion. Now, there\u2019s economic growth and economy growth, but that\u2019s way outsized, and that\u2019s what\u2019s driven the real value of the deposit franchise. Then wealth management - again, after Merrill putting it together and then driving the core aspects between the team there has kept us up to $300 billion, that\u2019s from 200 and something pre-pandemic and probably less than that - I think it was 200 at the time of the merger, so all these things are just part of it, and the GTS business, investments in that have driven those products, so that spread is high and growing again, which is kind of counterintuitive to the narrative that even one of your colleagues mentioned earlier, which is leave aside all the quantitative tightening and all the interest rates and all the stuff that\u2019s supposed to happen, quarter after quarter we\u2019re now growing the amount of deposits over the top of the loans, and the loans hopefully will kick back in and grow a little faster. But they still won\u2019t use a lot of those balances up, and so we feel very good about that position, and those deposits, as you can see on the bottom of Page 8 on the left-hand side, all-in cost is under 93 basis points against a Fed funds rate of 5.5, and the rate of change in those deposit prices has flattened out to be very modest quarter over quarter. That\u2019s just tremendous leverage for the company. Gerard Cassidy : Very helpful, Brian, thank you. Maybe as a follow-up, I think Alastair, you pointed to that your CET-1 ratios, Basel III ending, wondering as originally proposed, you\u2019re very comfortable with it. Can you guys share with us, what\u2019s the latest--you know, we all read about the watering down of Basel III ending. Do you guy have a sense when we may actually see a final proposal? Could it get kicked into next year, possibly? Alastair Borthwick : Look - we don\u2019t have an update on the timing yet, Gerard. We\u2019re in the same place you are - we\u2019re kind of waiting for the rules to come out, and we\u2019re still listening for updates from the Fed Chair and the Vice Chair, and we\u2019ll wait until we see those come out. Brian Moynihan : The key is we\u2019re sitting, every under the current interpretation, we told you earlier on without any modifications, we\u2019re sitting on enough CET-1 nominal amount, $197 billion, that exceeds what we\u2019d need for the increase in RWA under the current version of the rules as proposed. Anything that changes in that will be positive, Gerard. We don\u2019t need to retain capital to meet those standards, so we\u2019re off and running. Gerard Cassidy : Appreciate it, Brian. Thank you. Brian Moynihan : I believe that\u2019s--one more question? Okay. Operator : Yes, we\u2019ll take that question from Jim Mitchell of Seaport Global. Brian Moynihan : Morning Jim. Jim Mitchell : Oh hey, good morning. Maybe just one last follow-up on that last question from Gerard. If Basel III is reduced as Powell has suggested, is it with limited loan growth just more likely to be put towards buybacks, or do you see opportunities beyond loan growth, whether it\u2019s growing the trading balance sheet or other opportunities to deploy that capital, to drive growth? Just curious how you deploy that. Brian Moynihan : Well, number one, our primary interest is the capital to support our businesses, so you\u2019ve seen that happen in the markets business - as we said, it was one of the best quarters in a decade, first quarter. That is a multi-year process of building up not only the balance sheet and capital committed to the business, but importantly also the investments in systems and technology and risk management and those things, they continue to make money almost every trading day over the last several years, so that\u2019s where we\u2019d like to use it, supporting that business and supporting the loan business, supporting all the businesses. The reality is outside of the capital markets business, then you go to loan growth and the kind of loan growth in the mid single digits, that doesn\u2019t eat a lot of the capital up, so then it\u2019s just there to be returned, and so we\u2019ve got two basic phenomena. One is we store-housed a bunch of capital, if you think about the last few years, between the changes in CCAR a few years ago that changed the capital dimension, then the proposed rules and then now whatever happens with it, so they were sort of sit in the pandemic. Before that, we were sitting on a fair amount of capital - that should be released over time here, and then secondly the question will be what those rules are going forward, and then third will be what do you need to support the business, which again that\u2019s our primary responsibility. But generally, that is a modest amount of capital, and so most of our desire is really deploy more expenses in technology investments, and we\u2019ve gone from $3 billion to $3.8 billion in annual technology investments across the last couple years with more branches, but that\u2019s more of an expense question than a capital question, Jim. Jim Mitchell : Right, right. Brian Moynihan : [Audio loss] wealth management business, investment banking and trading. NII continues to outperform what we told you last quarter, for the first quarter. We rolled that into second quarter and we expect to continue performance in that as we go through the trough and meet the higher second half of the year. We continue to manage expenses well under the inflation rate, and we [audio loss] start with strong capital and liquidity and a strong balance sheet. The team has done a great job this quarter, and we look forward to talking to you next quarter. Thank you. Operator : This does conclude the Bank of America earnings announcement, and you may now disconnect. Everyone have a great day.",

Later, you will have the opportunity to ask questions during the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please note this call may be recorded. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Lee McEntire of Bank of America. Lee McEntire : Good morning. Welcome. Thank you for joining the call to review our second quarter results. Our earnings release documents are available on the Investor Relations section of the bankofamerica.com website and they include the earnings presentation that we will make reference to during the call. I hope everyone has had a chance to review those documents. Our CEO, Brian Moynihan, will make some opening comments before Alastair Borthwick, our CFO, discusses the details of the quarter. Let me just remind you that we may make forward-looking statements and refer to non-GAAP financial measures during the call. Forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause our actual results to materially differ from expectations are detailed in our earnings materials and SEC filings available on our website. Information about non-GAAP financial measures, including reconciliations to U.S. GAAP, can also be found in our earnings materials that are available on our website. So with that, let me turn the call over to Brian. Thank you. Brian Moynihan : Thank you, Lee, and good morning and thank all of you for joining us today. Before I begin today, I just want to reflect a second on the horrible events this weekend. We at Bank of America are clear that there's no place for political violence in our great country, and we continue to wish the former President Trump a speedy recovery. And our thoughts, of course, go out to the victims and their families and others impacted by this terrible event. With that, let's turn attention to the results for the second quarter of 2024 at Bank of America Corporation. This quarter, we achieved success in a number of areas, underscoring the benefits of our diversity and the dedication of our team to deliver responsible growth. Our organic growth engine continues to add customers and activity to all our businesses, even as we see the drop in net interest income this quarter. I'm starting on slide two. Our net income for the quarter was $6.9 billion after tax or $0.83 in diluted EPS. Attesting to the balance in our franchise, the earnings were split evenly, half in our consumer and GWIM businesses, which serve people, and the other half in our institutional-focused business global banking and markets. We grew revenue from the second quarter of 2023 as improvement in non-interest income overcame the decline in net interest income. Fees grew 6% year-over-year and represented 46% of total revenue in the quarter. Our strong fee performance was led by a 14% improvement in asset management fees in our wealth management businesses. We grew investment banking fees 29% year-over-year and saw sales and trading revenue increase 7%. Global Markets had its 9th consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth in sales and trading revenue, a good job by Jimmy DeMare and his team. Card and service charge revenue also grew by 6% year-over-year in our Consumer business. Much of this fee growth is a result of our intensity around organic growth, and is a testament to the diversity of our operating model. Now on to slide three. Organic growth has been driven by several key factors. First, we focus on our customers. We continue to place them at the center of everything we do. Consumer led the way in delivering solid organic growth with high-quality accounts and engaged clients. For the 22nd consecutive quarter, we had significant net new consumer checking accounts. We expanded our customer base and our market share. Specifically, we added 278,000 net new checking accounts this quarter, which brings our first six months of 2024 to more than 500,000. In wealth management, we added another 6,100 new relationships this quarter. In our commercial businesses, we added 1,000s of small businesses and 100s of commercial banking relationships. This has led to now managing $5.7 trillion in client balances, loans, deposits, and investments across the consumer and wealth management client segments. In those areas, we saw flows of $58 billion in the past four quarters. Our emphasis on personalized financial solutions and superior customer service has strengthened customer loyalty, attracted new clients across all our businesses. Our focus on providing liquidity and risk management solutions to our institutional clients positions to continue to gain more share of the wallet as well. Second, we continue to deliver innovative digital solutions. One of the primary contributors of both attracting and retaining customers to our platforms is our digital banking capabilities for our clients across all the businesses. Our fully integrated consumer banking investment app drives the utility for our customers across their investment and consumer accounts. Our use of stats are strong proof points. Our second language capabilities in our consumer businesses further enhance our customers' capabilities. You can see the continued digital growth in the slides on pages 26, 28, and 30 in the appendix. A couple highlights. Our consumer mobile banking app now serves more than 47 million active users. They logged in 3.5 billion times this quarter. We also continue to see more sales through the use of our digital properties. Digital sales represented 53% of our total sales in the past quarter in our consumer businesses. 23 million consumers are now using Zelle. They send money on Zelle at nearly 2.5 times the rate they write checks. And, in fact, more Zelle transactions -- send transactions take place than a combination of customer ATM transactions, cash withdrawals, and tellers. Simply put, Zelle has become a dominant way to move money. In our wealth management business, we are seeing more banking accounts being opened to complement the investment business those clients do with us. Importantly, these clients are also recognizing the ease of our digital banking capability. 75% of our new accounts and our Merrill teammates were open digitally. 87% of our global banking clients also are digitally active. We have innovated and significantly streamlined service requests by enabling clients to directly initiate and track transaction inquiries within our awarded CashPro platform, using AI to accomplish that. Third, we continue to make core strategic investments in our businesses. We're not complacent with the success you see on this page. We continue to strategically invest in our core businesses. A few examples, while we have the leading retail deposit share in America, we continue to invest and have opened 11 new financial centers this quarter -- in this first-half of the year and renovated another 243. This is an investment in both our expansion markets and our growth markets. In wealth management, we continue to invest in our advisor development program. It's grown to 2,300 teammates, allowing us to continuously add more than -- teammates to our 18,000 strong best-in-class financial advisory force across all our wealth management businesses. We're also adding teams of experienced advisors strategically in areas across the country. In our banking teams, we continue to add to our regional investment banking team. We now have more than 200 regional bankers across the country to better serve our commercial clients, and they complement our industry coverage to our corporate clients. In our global markets business, we continue to extend balance sheet to our clients in adding expertise and talent to continue to lead our market share improvements seen over the last several years. We also have increased our technology initiatives and expect to spend nearly $4 billion on technology initiatives this year. We have focused projects around artificial intelligence enhancements with both clients and our teammates. A recent example of our use of AI is our advisor and client insights tool. We've delivered more than 6 million insights here today to our financial advisors, providing them proactive reasons to engage our clients. AI has moved from cost savings ideas to enhancing the quality of our customer interactions. Fourth, organic growth is driving integrated flows across our business. We invest heavily in each line of business that compete in the markets based on their particular customer segment. But importantly, we also invest across our lines of business to knit them together and gain market share in the local markets. It's a differentiated advantage for us, our banking leadership position across our businesses and our nationwide franchise. For example, we leverage our franchise by connecting business customers with wealth management teams. Our teams across all our businesses have made 4 million referrals to other businesses in the first six months of this year. Next, we drive efficiency and effectiveness, and that's through our operational excellence platform. We continue to invest heavily in the future of our franchise and growth, while we also have to manage expenses day-to-day. Our focus on operational excellence has enabled us to hold our expense growth up to 2% year-over-year, well below the inflation rates. We continue to work to achieve operating leverages as NII stabilizes and begins to grow again. As you look at it now, Alistair will explain later, a fair portion of the year-over-year increase in expense is due to the formulaic incentives of wealth management due to the peak growth of that business. And last, our capital strength allows us to deliver for all our stakeholders. Our capital remains strong as we held our CET1 ratio at 11.9% this quarter. We grew loans, increased our share repurchases to $3.5 billion and paid $1.9 billion in dividends. Average diluted shares dropped below 8 billion shares outstanding. In addition, we also announced our intent to increase our quarterly dividend 8% upon board approval. Note that with 11.9% CET1 ratio, we remain in a solid excess capital position, both above the current regulatory requirements and the increased requirement to 10.7% beginning in October as a result of the recent CCAR exam. Let's turn to slide four. A couple things to note here. First, we've noted for several quarters that the second quarter NII would be the trough for this rate cycle. We expect NII to grow in the third quarter and fourth quarter of this year. Alistair is going to provide you some points in detail about the path forward. One of the important contributors to that change is deposit behaviors of our customers. On slide four, you'll note that average deposits grew 2% year-over-year and increased modestly linked quarter. The second quarter, in reality, is typically a heavy outflow quarter. We have a lot of customers who pay a lot of taxes in that quarter. Quarter-over-quarter increases in rates paid continue to slow again this quarter across all businesses except for wealth management. And we show you that on this page, slide four, by line of business. While wealth business deposit rates have moved higher with continued rotation, we expect those rates to begin to stabilize and the rate of quarterly change to decrease going forward. Turning to slide five, in previous calls, many of you asked questions or commented upon the question about consumer net charge-offs and when would they stabilize in the second-half of 2024. That expectation we have remains unchanged as well. This quarter's net charge-offs were 59 basis points. And for context, this is a stabilization of the rate. I would just remind you that prior to this quarter, I have to go all the way back to 2014 to see a charge-off rate of that high. And that's near when we were still emerging from the financial crisis. On slide four, we highlight the 30 and 90-day-plus credit card delinquency trends, which showed delinquencies have plateaued for the second consecutive quarter. This should lead to stabilized net credit losses in credit card in the second-half of the year. At the bottom of the page, note a couple of facts. First, on the payment rates. This is the rate of paydown on balances in a given month remain 20% above index to the pre-pandemic levels, even while our card customers have plenty of capacity to borrow. And importantly, because we're relation-based businesses, look at the right-hand slide at the bottom of page five. There you can see our deposit investment balances of our customers, who also have a card with us, remain 25% above their pre-pandemic levels, illustrating continued health of these customers. So if you think about consumer credit, the card charge-offs drive it, and they flattened out in terms of delinquencies, and we expect an improvement in the second-half. With regard to commercial real estate, our usual CRA credit exposure slide is included in our appendix. We continue to aggressively work through our loans in our modest CRA office portfolio. We saw a decrease in all the categories, a decrease in reservable criticized loans, a decrease in NPLs, and a decrease in net charge-offs. This supports our previous expectation that net charge-offs in the second-half of 2024 will be lower than the first-half of 2024. Our second quarter performance highlights Bank of America's ability to generate strong, sustainable growth through a combination of customer-centric strategies, innovation, strategic investments, and a commitment to a strong balance of risk and reward. We call that responsible growth. We're confident that focused approach will continue to drive long-term success and create value for you, our shareholders. Now I will turn it to Alistair for additional results. Alastair Borthwick : Thank you, Brian, and I'm going to start on slide six of the earnings presentation. I'll touch on more highlights noted on slide six as we work through the material. I just want to say upfront that we delivered strong returns with return on average assets of 85 basis points and a return on tangible common equity of nearly 14%. So let's move to the balance sheet on slide seven, where you can see we ended the quarter at $3.26 trillion of total assets, relatively unchanged from the first quarter. And not much to note here apart from a mixed shift of lower securities balances, mostly offset by an increase in reverse repo and modest loan growth, as well as global markets client activity. On the funding side, deposits declined $36 billion on an ending basis, reflecting typical seasonal customer payments of income taxes. And as Brian noted, average deposits were still modestly higher. Liquidity remained strong with $909 billion of global liquidity sources that was flat compared to the first quarter. Shareholders' equity was also flat compared to Q1, as earnings were offset by $5.4 billion in capital distributed to shareholders and a $1.9 billion redemption of preferred stock in the quarter. The $5.4 billion of capital contributions included $1.9 billion in common dividends and the repurchase of $3.5 billion in shares. AOCI improved modestly in the quarter and tangible book value per share of $25.37 rose 9% from the second quarter of last year. In terms of regulatory capital, our CET1 level improved to $198 billion and the CET1 ratio was stable at 11.9%. This 11.9% ratio remained well above our current 10% requirement, as well as our new 10.7% requirement as of October 1, 2024. Risk-weighted assets increased modestly and that was driven by lending activity. Our supplemental leverage ratio was 6% versus our minimum requirement of 5% and that leaves plenty of capacity for balance sheet growth. And our $468 billion of TLAC means our total loss-absorbing capital ratio remains comfortably above our requirements. Brian already covered deposit trends, so let's turn the balance sheet focus to loans and we'll look at average balances on slide eight. You can see average loans in Q2 of $1.051 trillion. They improved 1% year-over-year, driven by 5% credit card growth and modest commercial growth. The modest improvement in overall commercial loans included a 2% increase in our domestic commercial loans and leases, partially offset by a 4% decline in commercial real estate. Middle market lending saw an uptick in the quarter, and we saw good demand in our wealth businesses from custom lending. These areas of growth were largely offset by continued paydowns from our larger corporate clients on interest rate sentiment. Consumer growth was driven by credit card borrowing, and while home lending balances were flattish, originations picked up a bit this quarter. Lastly, and on a positive note, loan spreads continued to widen. As we turn our focus then to NII performance and slide nine, note that we moved the slide we typically use to talk about excess deposits to the appendix on slide 22, so you can see that there. Our excess deposit levels above loans remained high at $850 billion and continue to be a good source of value for shareholders. 52% of our excess liquidity is now in short-dated cash and available for sale securities. The longer-dated, lower-yielding hold-to-maturity book continues to roll off, and we reinvested again this quarter in higher-yielding assets. The blended yield of cash and securities continued to improve in the quarter and is now 160 basis points above our deposit rate paid. Regarding NII, on a GAAP [Technical Difficulty] Operator : To all locations on hold. Please remain on line, we are experiencing a technical difficulty. Please remain on line. You will hear music for just a moment. Alastair Borthwick : [Technical Difficulty] will materialize. And this now includes three interest rate cuts, starting in September, another in November, and one more in December. And the waterfall shows an estimated impact of those rate cuts to our quarterly NII. The next couple of categories are a result of natural management of interest rate risk in a balance sheet mixed with fixed-rate assets and variable-rate assets. And our balance sheet is split roughly half and half. So we take in liquidity from customers that we use to fund our assets, and then we store excess liquidity in cash and securities. We have fixed assets that mature and pay down, and those supply cash that then gets put back to work on the balance sheet and reprices over time. And we have two basic categories of fixed assets that mature and pay off, and those are securities and loans. On securities, you can see we've got about $10 billion a quarter of cash coming off of our securities portfolio, and we gain roughly 300 basis points of improvement on those assets when we put that money back on the balance sheet. On loans, between resi, mortgage, and auto, we've got another roughly $10 billion, which reprices with a little less yield improvement than securities. And between the securities and loans, we expect a fixed-rate asset repricing adds about $300 million to our quarterly rate of NII as we get to the fourth quarter. On the variable rate asset side, and to protect from down moves in rates, we hedge some of that with cash flow swaps. And those typically roll off in any given quarter and get replaced over time. So included in the cash flow hedges is an impact of cessation of BSBY as an alternative rate. If you recall, we took a charge in the fourth quarter of \u201823. It was $1.6 billion, and we said that would come back to us through time. And beginning in November, we start to see the benefit coming back into NII. And in Q4, that's about $200 million. That Q4 partial quarter benefit will grow by a slightly smaller sequential NII benefit in Q1 \u201825. And then it begins to taper off heading into 2026. In addition, we've got about $150 billion of received fixed cash flow hedges, protecting us from short rate moves moving over. Most are hedging floating rate commercial loans. And the cost of those hedges is reported as contra revenue in commercial loan interest income. These hedges have a weighted average life of just over two years. And they've got an average fixed rate of approximately 250 basis points. So starting in the second-half of 2025, we begin to get some additional NII tailwind, because the cash flow hedges with lower fixed rate likes where we receive, those will begin to roll off, and will likely replace those at higher current market rates at the time. The actual size of the tailwind we'll get from the expiration of those swaps will obviously be highly dependent on the level and the shape of the yield curve at the time of those maturities. And that stretches out over the course of the next four years. Okay, a couple other points to make. You'll note we don't expect much movement around our modestly, liability sensitive global markets NII activity. And lastly, our forward view has an expectation of low-single-digit growth in loans, low-single-digit growth in deposits, with continued slowing of rate paid movement through the back half of 2024. And you can see our expectation of the combined impact here as well. This last element is the one that has the most potential variability. And obviously, it will depend upon actual deposit and loan growth, and pricing and rotation. Okay, let's turn to expense and we'll use slide 11 for the discussion. We reported $16.3 billion of expense this quarter. And that's more than $900 million lower than Q1, which included $700 million for the FDIC special assessment. Not including the FDIC assessment, expenses were lower than Q1 by $229 million, driven by seasonally lower payroll tax expense. Compared to Q2 \u201823, we're up less than 2%. And that increase is equal to the incentives paid for improved fee revenue. Incentives for our GWIN business alone are up $200 million year-over-year. And that's obviously an expense we're happy to pay when we have a 14% improvement in fees for assets under management. Our second quarter headcount number included welcoming a diverse class of nearly 2,000 summer interns we hope will join us over the course of the next year or two upon their graduation. And absent those interns, our headcount fell by nearly 2,000. In the third quarter, we expect to add approximately 2,500 college graduates for full time. More than -- and that's from more than 120,000 applications received, showing that we remain an employer of choice for talented young people. Expense levels for the rest of 2024 are expected to bounce around this second quarter level, given the higher fee revenue and investments made for growth. So let's now move to credit and we'll turn to slide 12. There was little change in our asset quality metrics this quarter. Provision expense was $1.5 billion. That was $189 million higher than Q1, driven by a smaller reserve release in Q2. Net charge offs of $1.5 billion were little changed, with a small increase in credit card, mostly offset by lower commercial real estate office charge offs. On a weighted basis, we remain reserved for an employment rate of nearly 5% by the end of 2025, compared to the most recent 4.1% rate reported. The net charge off ratio was 59 basis points, largely unchanged for Q1. On slide 13, we highlight more credit quality metrics for both our consumer and commercial portfolios. Consumer net charge-offs increased by a modest $31 million versus the first quarter from the flow-through of higher late-stage credit card delinquencies from Q1. Highlighting the change in direction of delinquencies, consumer 90-day-plus delinquencies declined in 2Q by $57 million. Commercial net charge-offs were relatively flat as lower commercial real estate losses were mostly offset by a small increase in other commercial loans. Our office losses went from $304 million in Q1 to $226 million in Q2. Other commercial real estate loan losses were simply one hotel. Okay, let's move to the various lines of business and some brief comments on their results, and I'll start on slide 14 with consumer banking. For the quarter, consumer earned $2.6 billion on continued strong organic growth, and reported earnings declined 9% year-over-year as revenue declined from lower deposit balances, compared to the second quarter of last year. Customer activity showed another strong quarter, net new checking growth, another strong period of card openings, and investment balances for consumer clients, which climbed 23% year-over-year to a new record $476 billion. That included 12 months of strong flows at $38 billion in addition to market appreciation over the time. As noted earlier, loans grew nicely year-over-year from credit card, as well as small business where we remained the industry leader. The team held expense flat year-over-year, reflecting good work with continued business investments for growth, offset by the operational excellence work to improve processes and move more of our transactions to digital. And as you can see on the appendix page 26, digital adoption and engagement continue to improve, and customer satisfaction scores remain near record levels, illustrating customer appreciation of our enhanced capabilities due to our continuous investment. Moving to wealth management on slide 15, we produced good results, and those included good organic client activity, market favorability, and strong AUM flows, and this quarter also saw good lending results. Our comprehensive suite of investment and advisory services, coupled with our commitment to personalized wealth management planning and solutions, has enabled us to meet the diverse needs and aspirations of our clients. Net income rose 5% from the second quarter of last year to a little more than $1 billion. In Q2, we reported revenue of $5.6 billion, growing 6% over the prior year. As Brian noted, a strong 14% growth in fee revenue from investment and brokerage services overcame the NII headwind. Expense growth reflects the fee growth and other investments for future. The business had a 25% margin, and it generated a strong return on capital of more than 22%. Average loans were up 2% year-over-year, driven by strong growth we're seeing in custom lending and a pickup in mortgage lending. Both Merrill and the Private Bank continue to see good organic growth, and they produced strong assets under management flows of $58 billion since last year's second quarter, which reflects a mix of new client money, as well as existing clients putting more of their money to work. I also want to highlight the continued digital momentum in this business, and you can find that on slide 28. On slide 16, we turn to Global Banking results. And here, the business produced earnings of $2.1 billion, down 20% year-over-year, as improved investment banking fees and treasury services revenue were overcome by lower net interest income and higher provision expense. Revenue declined 6%, driven by the impact of interest rates and deposit rotation. The diversified revenue across products and regions reflects the strength of our Global Banking franchise. In our GTS business, fees for managing the cash of clients offsets a lot of the NII pressure from higher rates, and clients are accessing the capital markets for their capital needs instead of borrowing. Investment banking had a strong quarter, growing fees 29% year-over-year to nearly $1.6 billion, led by debt capital markets fees, mostly in leveraged finance and investment grade. And we finished the quarter strong, maintaining our number three investment banking fee position globally. A solid start to 2024 has left us in a good position, with top three rankings now in North America, Latin America, and EMEA, and number six in APAC. And we're seeing strong performance in important industry groups as well. An increase in provision expense from last year was driven by the commercial real estate net charge-offs I discussed earlier, and expense increased 3% year-over-year, including continued investment in the business. Switching to Global Markets on Slide 17, I'll focus my comments on results, excluding DVA as I normally do. The team had another terrific quarter as we generated good revenue growth and achieved operating leverage and continued to deliver a solid return on capital. Earnings of $1.4 billion grew 19% year-over-year, and return on average allocated capital was 13%. Revenue, and again, this is ex-DVA, improved 10% from the second quarter of 2023. Focusing on sales and trading, ex-DVA, revenue improved 7% year-over-year to $4.7 billion, and that's the highest second quarter in over a decade. FICC was down 1%, while equities increased 20% compared to Q2 '23. FICC revenues remained strong, and versus Q2 '23, they were modestly lower, driven by a weaker macro trading quarter in FX and rates, and that was largely offset by better commodities and mortgage trading. Equities was driven by strong trading results in derivatives and cash equities. Year-over-year expenses were up 4% on revenue improvement and continued investment in the business. Finally, on Slide 18, all other shows a loss of $0.3 billion, and that was little changed year-over-year, as lower expense was offset by lower provision costs as a result of reserve changes. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 9%, and excluding discrete items and the tax credits related to investments in renewable energy and affordable housing, the effective tax rate would have been 25%. And with that, I think we'll stop there, and we'll jump into questions. Lee McEntire : All right, Alistair, Brian, I just wanted to -- I did hear some feedback that maybe the audio from the call got interrupted for a moment. So at the point at which it got interrupted, I just want to reiterate a couple of points that Alistair was making. If you go back to slide nine, where I think we lost the audio, was where we started beginning a discussion about the performance from Q1 to Q2 of net interest income. That was driven by higher funding costs and the rotation of deposits seeking higher yield alternatives. And while higher again in Q2, both the rotation and the rate paid increases did continue to slow down. On the slide 10, I think the only points that I would make that Alistair began to discuss there was, we are just reiterating our expectation that quarter two would be the bottom for the NII in the rate cycle that we have been in. And our trajectory remains the same, the belief that our NII will begin to rise in Q3 compared to Q2 and then rise again in Q4. We provided the range of expectations that Alistair covered. And we expect Q4 NII to be around the $14.5 billion level, plus or minus. That would be approximately 4% to 5% higher than this quarter's NII. And he began that discussion by making sure that you know that we pick up an extra day of net interest income in the Q3, providing about $125 million of additional NII that also carries through into Q4. You see that on the slide. It also assumes that the current forward curve will materialize. That says that interest rate cuts will start in September. We will expect another one in November and December in the curve. And the waterfall includes an estimated impact of those rates to quarterly net interest income. And so then we started the discussion. He began the discussion on the fixed asset repricing, which then I think is where the audio picked back up again. And so we're happy to answer some questions on that. I know you'll have questions, but just wanted to recover that point, those points for you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Glenn Schorr of Evercore. Brian Moynihan : Good morning, Glenn. Glenn Schorr : Hi, thanks very much. Hello there. And definitely appreciate slide 10 a lot. I know you would have given us the 2025 NII guide if you wanted to give us one, so feel free to give that if you want, but that's not my question. My question is, given all the pieces of the puzzle that you gave us expectations for modest loan and deposit growth and slowing deposit-seeking behavior, if you get that 4% pickup from 2Q to 4Q this year that you're expecting, right now or at least recently, consensus had NII looking flattish with that fourth quarter number, and that doesn't make a lot of sense given all the pieces. So maybe if you can just comment directionally if you don't want to give the number of, does it make sense to you that we'd collectively be expecting flat NII with your higher fourth quarter number? Alastair Borthwick : So, Glenn, you're right. We're probably not going to give guidance around 2025 for all the reasons that you would expect. What we're trying to do here is reinforce for everyone what we've been saying from the beginning of the year, and that is we think Q2 is the trough, and we believe from this point we're in a good position to grow. Now, when you look at some of the elements of this bridge, you'll draw your own conclusions with respect to fixed-rate asset pricing is going to persist for some period of time, and you'll be able to draw your own conclusions, but I just want to point out we've been pretty clear on our guidance for Q1 and Q2. We've always felt like this would be the trough. We feel like Q3 and Q4 are likely to be better. You can see our work here. We've laid it all out. Nothing's really changed in terms of that. And the most important thing I think for everybody here is we feel like 2024 is a really foundational year. It's this twist period where we just got to get through the last of the deposit rotation, and we're establishing a foundation for growth from here, so that's what we're trying to convey. Glenn Schorr : Maybe I could just ask a follow-up on deposits within the wealth business. You have $4 trillion of client assets. I'm curious if you break out the split between brokerage and advisory accounts. Do you hear me okay? I'm hearing tons of feedback. Sorry, okay so $4 trillion in client assets -- great $4 trillion in client asset in wealth. I'm curious if you can give us the split between brokerage and advisory. And the reason I'm asking is, I'm curious how you've been handling rate paid on cash and advisory accounts and whether we should expect any behavioral changes following the recent wealth news. Thanks a lot. Sorry for the feedback. Alastair Borthwick : Look, Glenn, I'm not sure that distinction would be the distinction I'd look to. We've gone through a massive change in cash infused in the economy and withdrawn now under monetary policy, and so as we stabilize, our instructions to our team are to grow our deposit base a little bit faster than economy. That means you have to price across the board to achieve that. And what -- if you look at the slide four or five where I showed you sort of the change, what you see is the wealth management business takes a little bit longer because those clients have more investment cash with us, not what you're thinking investment accounts puts in their money, how they think about cash, they don't need for daily cash flow, and they move that around. That largely is over. And if you look in the last four or six weeks, we're seeing those deposits in that business bounce around the $280 billion level, not a lot of movement. And it'll keep moving in and out depending on customers paying down their income taxes, taking more risk in the market and all those things, but the deposit pricing changes that we made to ensure that they were at a platform they could grow, having been as high as $350 billion down to $280 billion were made in the quarter and all through the P&L. Glenn Schorr : Okay, fair [Technical Difficulty] on advisory. Thanks. Brian Moynihan : Sure. Next question. Operator : We'll take our next question from Jim Mitchell of Seaport Global. Jim Mitchell : Hey, good morning. Maybe just a quick follow-up, and I don't need to beat a dead horse on NII, but can we just -- can you just help us think through the puts and takes on, you have rate cuts at the end of the year. Forward curve implies more next year. As that cumulative impact starts to hit next year. I guess, what gives you confidence that this is sort of a trough? What are all the puts and takes that we should think about in how we model the NII for next year when we think about the forward curve and that impact? Alastair Borthwick : Jim, I think this bridge probably is all the right inputs for any given year. I mean, we've chosen to do it for 2024. We've already -- we've always resisted going out too far for the very simple reason that there's so many variables and they start to multiply with one another. If you think about even the rate cut one here we're using the three cuts, September, November, December. If I did this as of Wednesday of last week, there would have been two. Earlier in the year, there were six. So, since we don't know what that path looks like, it's very challenging then to provide guidance for '25 at this stage. What we're laying out here is, these are the component parts. We're going to get some benefit from fixed rate asset pricing over time. We're going to get some benefit in the immediate term from the BSBY cessation and that leading back into the P&L. As that rolls off, we'll get benefit from cash flow hedges repricing. And then we use the forward curve same as you do for the rate cuts. We benefit a little bit from global markets liability sensitivity. And then that final piece is the piece that we're trying to drive in terms of organic growth. We're trying to drive this loan growth, we're trying to drive the deposit growth. And as Brian pointed out, it's been a pretty unusual period in history, where we've had an enormous change in the rate structure and in the fiscal stimulus and the effects now fading away to something more normal. But that last box will come down to your assumptions versus our assumptions. And we will update you as we go through the next couple quarters, and we'll give you a better sense towards the end of the year. Jim Mitchell : Okay, that's all fair. And maybe just on the growth piece, maybe deposits seem to have bottomed for you guys in the second quarter of last year, you've had good growth, I think Brian pointed out, even with the tax headwind this quarter, you grew sequentially. So good performance, but still pretty modest. How are you thinking about the growth trajectory from here, I guess, as we think about, does it accelerate with rate cuts in your view? What are the dynamics are you thinking about that's returning to the historical kind of mid-single-digit deposit growth within BofA and the industry? Alastair Borthwick : Well, I think Brian covered slide four, that top left chart gives a sense for what's going on with the growth, that's average growth over time there. We've had four quarters in a row, so we feel good about that part. Q2 does tend to be a slower quarter just with all the tax payments. So we think deposits will do better over time, particularly as we get past peak Fed funds. We feel like the pricing and rotation, you can sort of see it in our numbers, they're slowing. So we're getting towards the end there. We're getting towards the end of QT. So we're not quite finished on all of those things yet. I'd be careful about getting too excited about deposit growth, but we feel like we're doing okay so far, we just got to keep driving that. Jim Mitchell : Okay, thanks for taking my questions. Operator : We'll take our next question from Mike Mayo of Wells Fargo Securities. Mike Mayo : Hi, I'll start with a simple question. You mentioned loan spreads have improved. Why is that? Where is that? Do you expect that to continue? Alastair Borthwick : Loan spreads have improved for us, Mike, over the course of the past I think it's now eight or nine quarters. It's primarily in the commercial businesses. And it's largely because we have to price the balance sheet for the returns that our shareholders expect. And that's true, I think, for the industry. And we've been quite purposeful in that regard. So we've tried to balance price spread and growth over the course of time, but it's primarily a commercial phenomenon at this point. And I would expect that to continue for the foreseeable future, but it's a competitive environment, we've got to see. Mike Mayo : Okay. You gave us slide 10, a lot of details there. You talked about September rate cuts, the fixed asset repricing, securities repricing, loans repricing, mortgage and auto, swaps maturing, November, we see fixed cash swaps and whole litany of stuff. But I think when you put it all together, what it's led to is a net interest margin of only 1.93%. In fact, I think your yield on your assets is below Fed funds right now. So would you agree that you're under-earning with that NIM of 1.93%? And I know I've asked this question before, but you always have to mark-to-market. What is a normal NIM? I mean, you were 2.5% in 2017, you were 3% in 2004. And I know the composition has changed and everything, but what's a normal NIM? And what do you think is a normal return on tangible common equity through the cycle? Thanks. Alastair Borthwick : So I'd say right now in terms of the 1.93%, we feel like we are under earning. We feel like that number is going to go up over time. It'll go up as net interest income goes up. But additionally, I think the balance sheet is likely to stay kind of flattish here. So the numerator is going to grow, the denominator is going to stay pretty tight here. So we think we're under-earning there. We think through a cycle, we got to get back to a more normal number like 2.30-ish over time. That takes a while. It's a grind, Mike, quarter-after-quarter, so that's where we're headed. And in terms of return on allocated capital, right now we're right around that 14%. We want to be 15% or higher for our shareholder. A lot of it is because we've accrued an awful lot of capital over the time -- over the course of time in advance of any potential capital changes. And the other final thing I'll just remind you is, we're a little different than some of the regional banks in that we've got an enormous global markets business. And that obviously makes an impact on the headline NIM number. Mike Mayo : Okay. And then just, I wasn't clear, you said net charge off in the second half should be less than the first half. And I wasn't sure if that related to cards or I wasn't sure what you meant by charge off. Brian Moynihan : Mike, that was me. And basically what I'm saying is you plateaued in terms of the delinquencies, which means the second-half is pretty well determined, as you know, because it's just a march from [36 to 90] (ph) to 180. And it'll be -- the charge off rate will be flattish. We're kind of back to normal 3.80% or so. We underwrite to actually have a higher charge off rate, quite frankly, in that intolerance, but that 3.80% is kind of where we see it since 3.80%. Mike Mayo : Okay, so credit card charge off should flatten or decline in the second-half relative to the first-half? Brian Moynihan : Exactly. Yes, remember, if you think about all the charge offs, that's not -- that's the dominant part of it on the consumer side by a lot. And then the commercial, we spoke to the question of CRE office, which has been dropped quarter to quarter. We expect the second-half to be better also. Mike Mayo : All right. Thank you. Brian Moynihan : Yes. Operator : We'll take our next question from Steven Chubak of Wolfe Research. Steven Chubak : Hi, good morning. Alastair Borthwick : Good morning, Steve. Steven Chubak : Good morning, guys. So I wanted to ask just on -- just building on some of the NIM questions from earlier, a lot of that's been focused on asset repricing, both loans and securities. I was hoping you could speak to the opportunity to potentially optimize some of your higher cost funding. And just given multiple sources of NIM improvement, looking beyond \u201824, how should we think about the pace of NIM build as we -- I know it's a longer timeline to get to the 2.30 to 2.40, but just how to think about the expectations around the NIM trajectory beyond \u201824? Alastair Borthwick : Well, your first point is a question of can we pay down some of the higher cost securities? The answer to that is yes. And that would be an expectation of ours as part of this. We've got some shorter dated CDs that can roll off. We can replace those or not. We have shorter dated debt. We've taken our long-term debt footprint down as we've continued to build the strength of the company. So there's a lot of different ways. It doesn't have to be securities reinvestment. It can be paying down higher cost liabilities as well. So we've got a lot of different ways that we can use, quote, the reinvestment, if you like, around the fixed rate. And then what was the second -- the second question was over what time period we expect to build? Steven Chubak : It's really about the NIM trajectory beyond \u201824. Alastair Borthwick : Yes. So, look, we're obviously on it right now. We feel like this is the trough. We're trying to build it from here. We'll make meaningful strides on that through 2025. That's where we're going. Steven Chubak : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Alastair Borthwick : Welcome. Operator : We'll take our next question from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Hi. Good morning. Alastair Borthwick : Good morning, Betsy. Brian Moynihan : Good morning, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : So, yes, another question on NII. Alastair, I did -- I think, hear you correctly when you said that as you go into the second-half of \u201825, there's going to be incremental benefits coming from swap roll-offs. Did I hear that right? Alastair Borthwick : Yes, that's correct. Second-half '25. So as we get closer, we'll be able to give you some kind of bridge like this that allows you to see what that looks like. But it's just -- it's a year out right now. Betsy Graseck : Yes, for sure. But I'm just wondering, is there anything that's -- like, I guess what I just would like to understand a little better is how the swap book is impacting slide 10. And then is it gradual into the second-half of '25 or is it a switch on in 3Q? Just understand how the swap book is playing into this thing. Alastair Borthwick : Yes. The -- yes. So the part that's important for slide 10 around the second half of this year is just the BSBY piece. It's not from cash flow swaps. Any cash flow swaps we have that roll off in the course of the next 12 months really, they're all kind of current coupon-ish, because anything that we did there was to do with LIBOR cessation or whatever. And so, they all got re-coupons. So I wouldn't worry about that. In the second-half and onwards, some of the older, longer-dated things, they've got the lower coupons. So that's when you know the BSBY number over time will disappear, but in the second half of '25, the cash flow number will begin to appear. So -- and we'll give you a sense for what that looks like over time, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : Okay, got it. And then on the far right-hand side of slide 10, you've got the yellow box, $50 million to $200 million. Could you just give us a sense as to what's the inputs to the $50 versus the $200, just so we can be able to track it as we go through the rest of the next two quarters? Alastair Borthwick : Yes. We're essentially using four variables. We're thinking, what will the loan growth be. What will the deposit growth look like. What will be the rotation between non-interest bearing and interest-bearing, and what will be any pricing changes we need to make, right? Then rotation pricing are pretty closely interlinked, that you could even call them the same thing. If you use more conservative numbers, you get towards the lower end. If you use slightly more constructive numbers, you get towards the higher. I think the point we're trying to convey is this last part, this yellow box is always the unknowable at the beginning of the quarter, where we're projecting. The pieces in the green, we kind of feel like we know what those look like. That's pretty predictable at this point, but we've got a little more certainty around that. So, the teams, we got 213,000 people, who are working really hard to try and make that dotted yellow box at the higher end. But obviously, it depends on our assumptions and it depends on our actions. Betsy Graseck : Super. Thank you so much for the color. Operator : We'll take our next question from Erika Najarian of UBS. Erika Najarian : Hi, good morning. Just my first question is trying to square, what you're telling us on the net interest income trajectory in the setup versus your disclosure. So, Alastair, you told us about, as a response to Glenn's question, the benefit from fixed asset repricing, cash flow hedges repricing in the second-half of '25. And when I look at table 40 from your queue, in both a parallel shift and a steepener scenario, down 100 is negative to net interest income? Is it because this is a 12-month look and like you pointed out, in the second-half of '25, you have underwater cash flow hedges that are rolling off. In other words, as we go through 2025, do you get less asset-sensitive? And additionally, what is the notional on those cash flow hedges that you're talking about? Alastair Borthwick : Yes. So the asset sensitivity that we disclose is meant to give a sense for what happens if nothing changes, it's totally static. So that's one difference. Number two, it's off of the future curve. So it's a 100 above whatever or below whatever the future curve is. So, I think it's a really helpful thing for sort of short-term moves and rates. Like take, for example, that orange box on page 10, it's helpful for something like that, but it's less helpful in terms of a predictor of where 2025 NII would be, because there's so many other inputs, Erika, over time. Erika Najarian : And just what's the notional of the cash flow hedges that you're referring to? Alastair Borthwick : Over time? Let's say, about $150 billion -- about $150 million. Erika Najarian : And how much of that starts rolling off in the second-half of 2025? Alastair Borthwick : Well, I think about it like this, you can almost think about it like it's like $10 billion or so every quarter. It's just that the ones that roll off for the first -- next 12-months, they're all kind of current coupons, so they won't really have any impact. Once you get into the second-half of 2025, they're a little bit lower rated. So that's when you begin to get some benefit there. And then I think probably Lee can give you more of the details following. Erika Najarian : Got it. And if I could just slide in one more question on the normalized NIM, Q3 and Q4 clearly is much higher than where you are now. Alastair, you mentioned we should assume a flattish balance sheet, but I think I had conversations with the company before in that half of that path between 19-ish to [2.3 to 2.4] (ph) has to do with balance sheet efficiency. And I'm wondering if you could carry out the balance sheet efficiency with and keep your balance sheet flattish? In other words, you know, obviously what the market is going to do is take your earning assets today and you know, apply two, three, five and say, okay, over time, whether it's \u201826 or \u201827, this is what BofA can earn under a normalized curve? I'm wondering if that's the right math to do, or should we expect some shrinkage of the balance sheet if you can -- that's part of the path for? Alastair Borthwick : Yes. I think what will happen is the underlying growth of the company will still be there, but we have some things that we know, just like Steve asked that question, is there any higher rate, shorter-dated stuff you'd like to pay off? Yes, there will be overtime. So I think we've got some ability to almost like self-fund the first $100 billion, $150 billion of growth in terms of earning assets. So that's why we're saying that'll keep the denominator down while we're growing the numerator. Erika Najarian : Okay, thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Ken Usdin of Jefferies. Ken Usdin : Hey, thanks. Good morning. Hey, Alastair, I just wanted to ask you a little bit more on the securities portfolio side, because you also have $180 billion or so of pay-fixed swaps on the AFS book. And so, we know about the HFS -- HTM maturity schedule, but how do you look at that AFS book and how much are those pay-fixed swaps currently in the money and kind of like how you're just thinking about that side of the portfolio as well? Thanks. Alastair Borthwick : Yes. Just remember, those are received fixed. So remember that there -- remember that is when we put the AFS in our portfolio, it's so that we've got a group of securities that are sitting there. They're typically treasuries. We swap them to floating, so that they look like they're cash as far as we're concerned. We don't have to worry about -- in fact, then to regulatory capital flowing through. And they just to us, they just look like cash equivalents. So that's how we think about it, Ken. Ken Usdin : Okay. And then just how do you manage that going forward with regards to, like the rate forecasts? Do those come off as the securities book matures or? Alastair Borthwick : Well, I mean, it's less of an interest rate call for us. It's more of going back to this concept of we've got $1.9 trillion of deposits and we've got $1.05 trillion of loans. So we've got $850 billion of excess. So when the excess comes in, we can do a variety of different things. We'd love to put it in loans, but that's always our first -- that's our first love. But in the absence of that, we're going to put it in cash or we're going to put it in available for sale, probably swap to floating for the most part. And we can choose to put things in hold to maturity if we choose to. But obviously, right now, we feel like we want hold the maturity just continuing to pay down. That's what's been happening over the course of the past 11 quarters. We're just going to keep going with that. So no particular changes to our philosophy around available for sale. Ken Usdin : Okay. And a quick one on expenses. I believe you said that costs are kind of hang in here at around the $16.3 that was reported. And so just kind of any color on puts and takes here, just is that better kind of revenue-related comp against your ongoing efficiencies? And just how do you think about longer-term expense growth again? Thank you. Brian Moynihan : Sure, Ken. If it -- I think honestly, the second quarter is sort of emblematic if you think about last year's second quarter. And this year's second quarter, we went from -- we went up by $300 billion -- $300 million, excuse me. As Alastair said, $200 million was just wealth management incentive comp and other growth was really other incentive comp. So the idea, the pressures we face now are really more due to fee growth in the businesses, which typically have a tighter correlation between fees and expenses and incentive comp related to those fees. So that -- as Alastair said, that's not a -- that's a good expense growth is what you want. It does grow and it grows at a good rate. Headcount is basically been bounced around relatively flat. We're 212 million this quarter and even adding a bunch of summer teammates. We were 215 last year. This quarter, the same summer teammates included. So managing headcount, redeploying people. We have the huge -- the cleanup stuff going on. We have the new initiatives going on, or freeing up work and moving it over. So we feel good about managing the company and that's against inflation rate wages at 3% or 5% going on inflation in all the services we buy in the third-party markets, obviously, that the world experiences. So we feel good about how we're managing expenses. The key is pretty simple. As you -- all the revenue side equation that, yes, Alastair has been talking about their colleagues on NII and stuff is that lifts and expenses stay relatively flat, you start moving towards positive operating leverage. We were minus 1% or something like that this quarter, kind of hanging in there. And we'll expect that to go back to the five-year track we had all the way up until the pandemic hit and things got thrown in the sun. Q \u2013 Ken Usdin : Thanks, Brian. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Gerard Cassidy of RBC. Q \u2013 Gerard Cassidy : Hi, Brian. Hi, Alastair. Brian Moynihan : Hi, Gerard. Alastair Borthwick : Hi, there. Gerard Cassidy : Brian, you talked -- and Alastair, both of you talked about the excess deposits. I think it was Slide 22 you pointed to. Can you share with us as you go forward and assuming the Federal Reserve does cut interest rates, I know you put, I think, free Fed fund rate cuts in your Slide 10. But as we go out into the end of '25, the forward curve is calling for obviously more rate cuts. Could you tell us how you expect to price your deposits as rates continue to follow with this excess deposit level? Can you be more aggressive in lowering your deposit costs? Brian Moynihan : Yes. I think that's very business and more importantly, customer-specific views, Gerard. So we think of our deposit strategies in the context of how our customers utilize our services. And so, if you think about the parts that priced up in Global Banking or the investment-related cash in the Consumer business and Wealth Management, that will come back down as rates come, because the short-term equivalents come down, some is absolutely mechanical because it's actually priced to meet a money market fund equivalent that will happen. And so, yes, I think if you think about us being all in, if you look on that slide at 203 basis points, there'll be some pickup as rates come down in those higher things. The zero interest balance accounts are low-interest checking. You know, they don't really move because there's zero interest or low interest, so they'll be kind of static, but they're still extremely valuable in the current context. So when you think of all the consumer, I think 60 odd basis-points or something, that's driven by the fact that we have $40-odd million transactional primary checking accounts that is growing at $1 million a year, meant, multiple years in a row, $900,000 a million a year that are maturing from $3,000 up to $7,000 or $8,000 in balances as people mature the relationship with us, that's where the tremendous value in the deposit base this company goes. And so if you think about $1.91 trillion having grown $100 billion almost from the trough, you think about it growing linked-quarter, multiple quarters in a row, you think about even as we look now to buy the balances above that amount. Yes, that -- those are good dynamics. So we think about it, but it will move. But if you remember, part of our deposit pricing is never going to move to zero. Gerard Cassidy : Right, right. No, no doubt. And those are the golden deposits. And one other question on slide 10 and also I think if I recall your first quarter queue, you guys indicated you were asset sensitive. I would assume that this slide 10 also shows that with the three rate cuts, Alastair, what would it take to move to a more neutral position on the balance sheet or even a liability-sensitive position should the Fed really get into a rate-cutting environment? Alastair Borthwick : Yes. So this is -- this shows that we're asset sensitive. That's why the red box obviously is bigger than the green box. It's the market specifically that's liability sensitive. So we're still asset-sensitive, Gerard. What it would take for us is either we can have a lot more rotation into interest-bearing or we could buy some short-dated duration, fixed-rate. So those are the two alternatives. And if you look at the course of time, if you were to go back to our queues over time, you'd see that we've become less and less rate-sensitive overtime. We've really narrowed the corridor of whether rates go up by 100 or down by 100, what could that outcome look like? Narrowed that pretty substantially over time because we're trying to lock in rates here, recognizing that NII is up $4 billion or $5 billion over the course of the past several years per quarter. Brian Moynihan : Yes. The last thing I'd say, Gerard, for a person who's been around this business as many years as you have, this has been a very abnormal rate environment for the last 15-years or so. And if you get to where you have a one Fed funds rate 3.5, which is what our experts predict, it sort of stops out at the ability to bring the asset sensitivity tighter and tighter is there because you actually have room to move down without hitting zero floors and stuff. So there's -- and so stability during time periods of which the rate environment doesn't flip around. And then secondly, a higher nominal rate environment allow you to manage to that outcome because part of the other outcome for us is just as rate -- the rate structure is nominally very low is the zero floors kick-in and that creates a amount of sensitivity that over time will go away if rate structure is higher. That makes sense to you? Gerard Cassidy : Yes. No, it does. Thank you. And just Brian or Alastair, one last quick question. I noticed in slide 25, your home equity loan balance has actually increased. I think that's the first time in maybe over two years or three years. Was there a new program or what are you seeing that drives that? And that -- and should that or can that continue as we go forward into '25? Thank you. Brian Moynihan : Yes, I think it just reflects that the people have locked in low-rate loans and now that they want to borrow. It's an expensive view because they've got a fixed-rate mortgage loan and they've got a home equity sitting on top of why wouldn't they use it. I like it for it was only two years. It's been four years or five years since that balance went from $30 billion started declining, so it's good to see. I'll note at the bottom of that page, if you look at year-over-year mortgage production $5.7 billion and $5.9 billion and you look at home equity line production, which is new originations in the boxes, solid. But it is nice to finally see that the actual balances have stabilized and we'll see -- they're kind of flattish, they're not really growing, but it's nice to see them not just keep coming down and hopefully, they'll start to be utilized. Our expectation would be, they will be as consumers over time want to take out part of the equity in their home at a rate that is reasonable, but doesn't require to refinance the whole first. Gerard Cassidy : Great. Thank you, again, Brian. Operator : We'll take our next question from Vivek Juneja of JPMorgan. Vivek Juneja : Hi, thanks for the questions. Just a little color on non-interest-bearing deposits. When you look at an average basis, the decline has clearly slowed sharply. Period end was down at a faster rate. Is that just the noise around end of 1Q? Or what are you seeing as you look sort of month-by-month? Is that truly slowing or yes -- and talk to it a little bit by customer segment, if you can, please? Alastair Borthwick : Yes. I think, Vivek, you're catching two things. First one is it is slowing, that rotation is slowing and we would expect that because at the end of the day, this is mostly cash in motion, it's transactional accounts, that's why it's non-interest bearing. And the answer why it's a little different this quarter is because of the seasonality of tax payments. For anyone who has a big tax payment due, they frequently just allow it to, they may pull it out of their brokerage account, put it into their -- they may put it into their non-interest-bearing and then they're wiring it out from there. So that's, again, an example of money in motion, but that's what's going on this quarter. Vivek Juneja : A quick one, Visa B derivative gains, did the -- did you have anything in your equity derivatives trading revenue this quarter? Alastair Borthwick : Nothing to highlight, nothing to note. That's a position we sold years ago and anything that's happened with Visa would just unwind on the balance sheet. We've recycled it, so it shouldn't have any impact to revenue. Vivek Juneja : Thank you. Operator : We'll take a question from Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank. Brian Moynihan : Good morning, Matt. Matt O'Connor: Good morning. How are you guys thinking about kind of targeted capital levels going forward? Obviously, we're still waiting for final rules. Maybe there's a little more volatility in your SCB than you would have thought, but you still got a nice buffer? And then I guess one last piece I was thinking is the remixing of the balance sheet that's been commented kind of throughout this call over time probably causes a little creep in RWAs, right, like loans higher than, say, securities. So lots of excess capital, but some puts and takes and how are you thinking about it between now and when we get final guidelines? Brian Moynihan : The first thought, I think we always want to use the capital to grow the business. So if we need to use it to support RWA growth for loans or something, that's a good outcome and that's what we want to do first. Second, we maintain the 11.9% quarter-to-quarter with a little bit RWA increase, I think that would be emblematic. And we bought $3.5 billion, paid out $1.9 billion in dividends. So you'd expect that kind of to continue on in terms of that basic idea of we don't need a lot of capital to grow, because the RWA demands are met with a fairly straightforward amount. We're earning a nice amount of dollars and we'll deploy it back in the dividend and the buybacks. Well, our job is to maintain -- our view is we will maintain a 50 basis point type of management buffer to whatever the requirements are. The volatility, well, there's a whole different discussion on that in terms of the wisdom of that. But the reality is the volatility is absorbable, because you have time to plan into it and get done within a race we've seen. So whether we agree with the volatility or not, we've easily absorbed it and the new rule is coming out. We'll see what happens and we'll adjust. But just think of this as basically a requirement of 10.7 under the new SCB plus 50 is 11.2. Maybe you get a little tighter if you feel you got great insight to what happens next year. And then I think the finalization of all the three will come through and we'll see what that is and see how that all correlates to the various aspects. But we feel good about where we are and expect that all current earnings are basically available to support the growth we're talking about in the current economic environment. That's relatively modest need, but really the rest of it just goes plowing back to you. Matt O'Connor: Okay. And then just to summarize that, I mean, do you think about bringing down the 11.9 to 11.2 kind of in the near term or to make it obvious, like, wait -- that's a little bit more theoretical and wait for the capital rules to play out? Brian Moynihan : I think we just -- we need to see how the next 60, 90, 120 days play out. We heard a lot of discussion about the timing of a re-proposal or not, et cetera. So we had a lot of flexibility and -- but we continue to focus on shareholder value creation and all of that. But I think we're in a critical spot for the industry in terms of learning the outcome of a lot of these things over the next short period of time here. Matt O'Connor: Okay. Thank you. Operator : That concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I'd be happy to return the call to Brian Moynihan for closing comments. Brian Moynihan : Thank you, operator. Thank all of you for joining us today. Obviously, a lot of focus on NII, and we gave you the Slide 10 to give you the bridge. Alistair answered a lot of the questions, Lee's here to answer it. The key is to understand what's driving that, which is deposit performance, which is stabilized and starting to grow for like six quarters in a row now, loan growth very low, but just staying positive. Those are going to drive the value of this franchise, and that's going to grow with buyer customers. That's coupled with strong fee performance this quarter in terms of wealth management fees, investment banking fees, consumer fees, even growing global payment services fees and of course, the great work done by our markets team. So that leveled with flattish expenses, gives us a chance to start driving operating leverage again in the company. And that generates a lot of earnings, a lot of excess capital, and we put that back in your hands. So thank you for your time and attention. We look forward to talking next quarter. Operator : This does conclude today's Bank of America earnings announcement. You may now disconnect your lines. And everyone, have a great day.",

Later, you will have the opportunity to ask questions during the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please note this call may be recorded. I will be standing by if you should need any assistance. It is my pleasure to turn the program over to Lee McEntire. Lee McEntire : Good morning. Welcome, and thank you for joining the call to review our third quarter results. Our earnings release documents are available on the Investor Relations section of the bankofamerica.com website. They include the earnings presentation that we'll make reference to during this call. I hope everyone's had a chance to review those documents. Our CEO, Brian Moynihan, will make some opening comments before Alastair Borthwick, our CFO, discusses the details of the quarter. Let me just remind you that we may make forward-looking statements and refer to non-GAAP financial measures during the call. Forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause our actual results to materially differ from expectations are detailed in our earnings materials and our SEC filings that are available on the website. Information about non-GAAP financial measures, including reconciliations to U.S. GAAP can also be found in our earnings materials that are available on the website. So with that, Brian, take it away. Brian Moynihan : Thank you, Lee, and good morning, and thank all of you for joining us for our discussion of our third quarter results. Bank of America continued to demonstrate strength this quarter in an economy that continued to be stable, albeit with slower growth and falling inflation. So many of you asked me from time-to-time what do we see in our own customer -- consumer customer base. As we talked about many times, our consumer payments is an indicator of activity. Those payments were up 4% to 5% year-over-year for the quarter in the total money those consumers moved in the economy. The pace of year-to-year money movement has been steady since late summer this year. After having fallen in the spring and early summer. This growth in consumer payments continues into October. This activity is consistent with how customers are spending money in the 2016 to 2019 timeframe. When the economy was growing, inflation was under control. This report is not meant to gainsay that consumers are worried of the cost of living, worried about higher rates and other matters. But overall activity is fine, unemployment is low and wage growth is steady, both of which bode well for the consumer overall and for consumer asset quality. With respect to what we see in our commercial businesses, it is consistent with a lower growth economy. Line of credit usage rates remain lower than pre-pandemic levels. This does not surprise us what with the dramatic increase in the cost of borrowing for small and medium-sized businesses. They aren't being indolent, they want to grow. They are simply being more careful and worry a final demand will hold. Therefore, they are being cost conscious across the board. So how did Bank of America do against this backdrop? At Bank of America, our commitment to responsible growth remains unwavering, and this quarter is another illustration of that. We grew, we did it the right way. In the third quarter, Bank of America generated $25.5 billion in revenue and earned $6.9 billion in net income after tax. Year-to-date, we've generated net income of just over $20 billion. Four quarters ago, we called that a bottom would occur in our net interest income in the second quarter of 2024. Even with a rate environment that has bounced around quite a bit since we said that we got it right. As we expected then, NII indeed troughed in the quarter two. NII grew 2% this quarter and Alastair will note later, we expect NII to grow again in quarter four, even as the market expects two more rate cuts in quarter four. This quarter, we saw a healthy revenue growth in our wealth and investment management business and in our global markets businesses. We returned 5.6 billion of capital to shareholders while also supporting the needs of our clients. So with that brief overview, let's dive into Slide 2. Earnings per share came in at $0.81 this quarter at $25.5 billion in revenue we grew modestly from the third quarter, '23 as improvement in noninterest income more than offset a year-over-year decline in net interest income. Fees grew 5% year-over-year and represented 45% of total revenue. The strong year-over-year fee performance was led by a 15% improvement in investment in brokerage services, mostly in our global wealth management business. We also grew investment banking fees 18% year-over-year sales and trading revenue increased 12% year-over-year and aggregate, these market related revenue streams rose an impressive 13% year-over-year. Our total expense in the company increased 4%. You can attribute most of the year-over-year expense growth to these market related areas. Overall, a good job by the team. On asset quality a few quarters ago we told you that consumer credit losses would go down this quarter, given delinquency trends we had seen at the time. We also told you that office losses would be lower. Both of these proved true again this quarter. Good asset quality resulted in net charge-off in provision expense for this quarter at $1.5 billion, which was unchanged from last quarter. Our performance is partly attributable to the diversity and balance of the company. A little more than half our earnings come from our consumer and GWIM businesses serving people and the other half come through from our Global Banking and Markets businesses serving companies and institutional investors. So let's turn to see how we grew organically this quarter. We are now on Slide 3. Our organic growth has been driven by a continued focus on customers and client experience throughout all our businesses. Consumer leads the way delivering solid organic growth with high quality accounts engaged clients. For the 23rd consecutive quarter, we added significant net new consumer checking accounts and expanded our customer base and market share. We added 360,000 net new checking accounts this quarter, which brings our first nine months of '24 to more than 880,000 net new checking accounts. In wealth management, we added another 5,500 net new relationships this quarter. In our commercial businesses, we added hundreds of small business and commercial banking relationships. Also note that we saw a strong organic growth of investment balances with banking customers and growth in banking products for our investment clients in our GWIM business. This has led us to now manage $5.9 trillion in client balances of loans, deposits and investments across the consumer and wealth management clients. We saw flows of $62 billion into those businesses in the past four quarters. In our Global Banking business, we saw loan demand start to pick up late in the quarter. We again ranked third in the logic IB fees we received and have a solid pipeline. Our global transaction services platform continues to grow around the world and showed strong deposit growth for our commercial businesses over the last year and a quarter. This quarter, global markets saw continued momentum. Global markets recorded the 10th consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth in sales and trading. Investments we've made in this business and the intensity of the teams has enabled a 35% improvement in sales and trading revenue in the past three years. Good work by Jimmy DeMare and the team. Our customers and clients continue to want more from us, especially when it comes to our digital capabilities. So let's discuss this on Slide 4. Slide 4 highlights this continued success across our digital platforms. As usual, we include our disclosures on digital stats across the business, which we believe lead the industry. I commend you the pages in the appendix, which give you more granular disclosure for each of the businesses' digital activities. Our fully integrated consumer banking investment application drives the utility for our customers across GWIM and consumer. The usage stats you see are strong proof points. Our second language capabilities also enhance the customer's experience. We have grown to more than 48 million active digital users and those digital users logged in more than 3.6 billion times this quarter. We also continue to see more sales through their digital properties. Digital sales represented 54% of our total consumer sales this quarter. Note that it simply takes both high-touch and high-tech to drive continued growth with individual clients across the wealth spectrum in America. Erica, our AI enabled virtual assistant reached 2.4 billion client interactions since its launch and Zelle showed continued user and usage increases. In our wealth management business, we continue to see full relationships increase with both investing and banking relationships being open. 75% of new accounts in Merrill were opened digitally whether they were banking accounts or investment accounts. This enables more efficient customer coverage for our advisory teams. Finally, 87% of our Global Banking relationship clients are digitally active. We have innovated and significantly streamlined service requests by enabling clients to directly initiate and track inquiries within our award winning cash flow platform. As a result, app sign-ins for these clients increased nearly 80% in just the last 24-months. In summary, the economic environment remains solid. Issues remain out there to external factors that could affect our business and the economy generally. We still see great opportunities for continued growth across all our businesses. We are focused on driving market share in all our businesses, investing in technology to further enhance the customer experience and continue to increase our efficiency. With NII now growing and complementing our fee growth along with our continued solid expense discipline, we expect to return to operating leverage as we move through the quarters in 2025. With that, I'll turn to Alastair for additional details. Alastair Borthwick : Thank you, Brian, and I'm starting on Slide 5 of the earnings presentation. We'll touch on more highlights noted here as we work through the material, and I'd just add that we delivered solid returns with a return on average assets of 83 basis points and return on tangible common equity of 12.8%. So let's move to the balance sheet on Slide 6, where you can see that the balance sheet ended the quarter at $3.3 trillion of total assets, up $66 billion from the second quarter, as global markets client demands expanded and commercial loans grew $16 billion in the quarter. Otherwise in the quarter, the investments of our excess liquidity saw a $10 billion reduction in hold to maturity securities, and the combination of shorter-term liquidity investments of cash and available for sale securities were relatively flat for the second quarter. On the funding side, global markets grew to support balance sheet needs of our clients and total deposits grew $20 billion on an ending basis. It's noteworthy that our average deposits are now up for the fifth consecutive quarter. Liquidity remains strong with $947 billion of global liquidity sources, and that was up $38 billion compared to the second quarter. Shareholders' equity was up $2.6 billion, with common equity up $4.6 billion and a preferred redemption driving a $2 billion decline in preferred equity. The increase income and equity compared to Q2, included $5.6 billion in capital returned to shareholders, partially offsetting our earnings, and it included an improvement in AOCI driven by an improvement from cash flow hedges given the drop in long-term rates in the quarter. $5.6 billion in capital distributions includes $2 billion in common dividends and the repurchase of $3.5 billion in shares. Tangible book value per share of $26.25 rose 10% from the third quarter of '23. And turning to regulatory capital, our CET1 level improved to $200 billion and the CET1 ratio was 11.8%. And that remains well above our new 10.7% requirement as of October 1. Risk weighted assets increased modestly, driven by both lending activity and global markets needs to support clients and our supplemental leverage ratio was 5.9% compared to the minimum requirement of 5%, which leaves plenty of capacity for balance sheet growth. Our $463 billion of total loss-absorbing capital means our TLAC ratio remains comfortably above our requirements. So let's dig a little deeper on deposits and the growth from the second quarter using Slide 7. Here, we show you deposits and rates by line of business. Average deposits grew $45 billion, or 2% year-over-year, and they increased modestly linked-quarter. Notably, quarter-over-quarter increases in rates paid continue to slow again this quarter, rising 7 basis points to 210 basis points. Consumer Banking increased modestly, driven by product mix and higher rate product offerings. And Global Banking rate paid increased modestly driven by growth in interest bearing balances. It's worth noting that wealth management declined a basis point. We acted quickly following the September 50 basis point rate cut in our wealth business and our Global Banking business, and since late in the quarter, only a small portion of those cuts are reflected. Total rate paid for all deposits from these actions is expected to fall below 2% later in October, as the fuller effect of the pass-throughs occur. Let's turn to loans by looking at average balances on Slide 8. Loans in Q3 of $1.06 trillion improved 1% year-over-year driven by solid commercial loan growth as well as credit card and vehicle loans. Overall, commercial loans grew 2% year-over-year. And importantly, this included a drop in commercial real estate loans of 6%. Commercial loans, excluding commercial real estate, grew 3% year-over-year and were up 6% annualized from the Q2. Consumer banking loan growth was driven by credit card, small business and vehicle borrowing, and the overall consumer growth was muted by a decline in mortgage balances as pay downs exceeded originations in a higher rate environment. Let's turn our focus to NII performance and Slide 9. So note that our trended investment of excess deposit slide is in our appendix on Page 21. Deposit levels were $855 billion in excess of loans at the end of Q3 and continue to be a good source of value for shareholders. Nearly $625 billion or 52% of our excess liquidity is in short dated cash and AFS securities. The longer dated lower yielding hold to maturity book continues to roll-off, and we reinvest that in higher yielding assets. The blended yield of cash and securities on Page 21 remains well above our deposit rate paid. So going back to Slide 9, regarding NII on a GAAP, non-FTE basis, NII in Q3 was $14 billion and on a fully tax equivalent basis, NII was $14.1 billion. On our Q3 earnings call last year, we first provided our expectation that the Q2 would be the trough and then we would begin to grow in the Q3 of '24, marking an inflection point for NII. And that's what you see this quarter. NII increased by $252 million from the Q2 driven by a number of factors. Global Markets activity and pricing, fixed asset repricing and one extra day all benefited NII, while higher funding costs partially offset those benefits. A 50 basis point rate cut in September also negatively impacted NII. With regard to a forward view of NII, there are obviously several variables at play in the Q4, and we still expect Q4 NII to grow, and we expect it to be $14.3 billion or more on a fully tax equivalent basis. Now we note the following assumptions. First, we assume that the forward curve on October 10, is the one that materializes, so that includes a 25 basis point cut in November and another 25 basis points in December. We also assumed very modest balance increases in both loans and deposits in Q4, building off the activity seen in Q3. Last quarter, we told you we expect about $20 billion in the aggregate of fixed rate loans and securities to reprice on a quarterly basis, and those are expected to reprice into higher yielding assets and provide a benefit to NII for many periods ahead. And as described previously, we expect to see roughly $200 million benefit in Q4 from the BSBY alternative rate transition. So we think this sets us up well for 2025. With regard to interest rate sensitivity on a dynamic deposit basis, we provide a 12-month change in NII for an instantaneous shift above or below the forward curve. On that basis, a 100 basis point increase would benefit NII by $1.8 billion, while a decrease of 100 basis points would decrease NII over the next 12 months by $2.7 billion. Okay, let's now turn to expense and we'll use Slide 10 for the discussion. We reported $16.5 billion in expense this quarter, up 1% from the second quarter, driven by the revenue improvement in three primary areas that Brian noted earlier. Investment banking, investment broke - and brokerage fees and sales and trading revenue all have more activity and incentive variability than other revenues, and they were up 3% in aggregate versus the second quarter and up 13% year-over-year. In Q3, our headcount of 213,000 was up a little more than 1000, and this quarter we saw the departure of roughly 2,000 summer interns and we welcomed roughly 2500 college graduates from the nearly 120,000 applications received. Regarding a forward view in Q4, we don't expect much change in our headcount, and with continued investments we expect expense to be in line with Q3 at $16.5 billion. As we look into 2025, with an expected return of NII growth and through our expense discipline, we expect a return to operating leverage, an improvement in our efficiency ratio. Let's turn to credit on Slide 11. And the good news is there's not a lot to report here compared to the second quarter. Net charge-offs of $1.5 billion were flat compared to Q2. We've seen consumer losses in a pretty tight range for a few quarters now. Outside of that, we saw lower losses from office exposure and otherwise we had two somewhat unrelated commercial losses. The net charge off ratio was 58 basis points, down one basis point from Q2. Provision expense was unchanged from Q2 at $1.5 billion as reserve levels remain constant. And with regard to reserve levels on a weighted basis, we remain reserved for an unemployment rate of 5% by the end of 2025 compared to the most recent 4.1% rate reported. On Slide 12, we highlight the credit quality metrics for both our consumer and commercial portfolios, and there's nothing really noteworthy to highlight on this page. So let's move to the various lines of business and some brief comments on their results, starting on Slide 13 with consumer banking. Consumer banking continues to lead the company in organic growth, and this included another strong quarter of net new checking growth, another strong period of card openings and investment balances for consumer clients, which climbed 28% year-over-year to a record $497 billion. It also included 12-months of strong flows at $29 billion in addition to market appreciation. As noted earlier, loans grew nicely year-over-year from credit card and vehicle as well as small business, where we remain the industry leader. One highlight to note, our Practice Solutions Lending Group for doctors and dentists and related professionals saw loans grow 11% year-over-year. All of this organic growth helped to drive $2.7 billion in net income in Q3. So reported earnings remained strong, declining 6% year-over-year as revenue declined from lower NII, partially offset by higher card income. With the trajectory shifting in NII, we should see earnings in this business begin to shift as well. Expense rose 5% as we continued our business investments. And those investments included those in our people, including the announcement of moving our minimum wage to $24 per hour and that raises the minimum annualized salary for our associates to nearly $50,000. As you can see on the appendix Page 25, digital adoption and engagement continue to improve and customer satisfaction scores remain near record levels illustrating the appreciation of enhanced capabilities from our continuous investments. Bank of America's 23 million Zelle users are up 10% in the past 12-months and their volume usage is now up more than 20%. Customers are now using Zelle at nearly 3x the rate they're writing checks, and Zelle usage has meaningfully surpassed the combination of checks written and ATM withdrawals. Moving to Wealth Management on Slide 14. We produced good results, reflecting healthy organic growth and client activity with increased banking activities of our clients and the impacts of increased market levels together with strong assets under management flows. With a continued increase in banking product usage from our investing clients, the diversity of our revenue base continues to improve. More than 60% of our wealth clients now have banking products with us and 30% of our revenue is now in net interest income to complement the fees earned in our advice model. Net income rose from the third quarter '23 to $1.1 billion this year. In Q3, we reported revenue of nearly $5.8 billion growing 8% over the prior year, led by 14% growth in asset management fees that Brian highlighted earlier. Expenses growth reflects the fee growth and other investments for our future growth as we continue to grow our advisor force through hiring of both experienced advisors and graduates from our training program. We welcomed 5,500 Merrill and Private Bank net new households this quarter and more than 1/3 of those Merrill openings were driven by graduates from our training program. The business had a 25% margin and generated a strong return on capital of 23%. Average loans were up 3% year-over-year, driven by growth in custom lending and a pickup in mortgage lending. Both Merrill and the Private Bank continue to see healthy organic growth, producing strong assets under management flows of $65 billion year-over-year, which reflects a good mix of new client money as well as existing clients putting money to work. We should also highlight the continued digital momentum that you'll find on Slide 27. As an example, three quarters of Merrill Bank and Investment accounts were opened digitally this quarter. On Slide 15, you see Global Banking results. This business produced earnings of $1.9 billion down 26% year-over-year as improved investment banking fees and treasury services revenue were overcome by lower net interest income and higher provision expense. Revenue declined 6%, driven by the impact of interest rates and deposit rotation. In our global treasury services business, fees for managing the cash of clients continue to offset some of the NII pressure from higher rates. Investment banking had a strong quarter, growing fees 18% year-over-year to $1.4 billion, led by debt capital markets fees, mostly in leveraged finance and investment grade. We finished the quarter strong, maintaining our number three investment banking fee position. What began as a slow quarter this summer gained some momentum through September and the pipeline looking forward looks solid. An increase in provision expense from last year was driven by the previously noted commercial and CRE losses. Expense increased 7% year-over-year, including continued investments in the business, particularly around technology. Switching to global markets on Slide 16. I\u2019ll focus comments on results excluding DVA as we normally do and the team continued their impressive streak of strong revenue and earnings performance. They achieved operating leverage and continued to deliver good return on capital. Earnings of $1.6 billion grew 23% year-over-year and return on average allocated capital was 14%. Revenue again, ex-DVA improved 14% from the third quarter of last year as both sales and trading and investment banking fees for institutional clients improved nicely year-over-year. Focusing on sales & trading, ex-DVA revenue improved 12% year-over-year to $4.9 billion. FICC increased 8% while equities increased 18% compared to the third quarter of '23. FICC revenues remained strong growing over both the prior year and the second quarter, driven by momentum in currencies trading. Equities had a record third quarter driven by strong trading performance in derivatives and cash. Year-over-year expenses were up 6% on revenue improvement and our continued investment in the business. Finally, on Slide 17, all other shows a loss of $295 million. Revenue was lower and included a charge to other income of roughly 200 million related to Visa's increase in its litigation escrow account. The decline in expense was driven by reduced costs of a liquidating business and lower legal expense. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 6% and excluding discrete items and the tax credits related to investments in renewable energy and affordable housing, the effective tax rate would have been approximately 24%. So that's where I'll stop, and with that we'll open it up for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Jim Mitchell of Seaport Global. Jim Mitchell : Hi, good morning. I guess I'll ask the NII question. Alastair, you talked about still feel comfortable troughing in the second quarter, poised to grow. So can you maybe give us a little bit more on - based on the forward curve, any kind of rough thinking on how NII, the trajectory from here beyond 4Q? And what kind of growth you may be thinking about in '25? Just any kind of bigger than a bread box conversation would be helpful. Alastair Borthwick : I think if we went back to three quarters ago, we sort of saw this trough appearing in the second quarter. And we felt like as the deposits were beginning to find a floor, we'd be in a position where we could begin to see NII growth. So obviously, that happened in Q3. And at this point, we feel like we're in a good position to do that again in Q4. We'll provide guidance, I think, for 2025 when we get back together again a quarter from now. Part of the reason we try not to do it 15 months in advance is because an awful lot moves with the rate curve. Remember, this year, at one point, we had six cuts another point, we had one cut. And even this past quarter, I think the market was surprised with an extra cut. What we're focused on then is just driving the underlying organic growth. So deposit growth, we're getting to a point now we've had five quarters in a row. Global Banking is back to normal seasonality. Wealth is flattening out. And Consumer is slowing and is in a place now where we think we're pretty close to finding that floor. So deposits in a good place, the rotation is slowing. We've got a little pickup in loan growth this past quarter, that's good. We've got the fixed rate asset repricing over time from which we'll benefit, and we've got some cash flow swaps resetting as well. So look, we're in a position where we're we believe we're going to grow NII again in the Q4. That's going to set us up, I think, quite well in terms of 2025. And importantly, we've acted fast with that first couple of rate cuts, so feel like we've put ourselves in a good position to grow from here. Jim Mitchell : Okay. That's helpful. And maybe just a follow-up on the deposit question. You guys had really strong growth in net new checking accounts, but consumer deposits still shrinking a little bit. Do you see any change in behavior since the rate cuts? Or how are you thinking about consumer deposit growth and wealth too? I guess we're seeing commercial growth, but sort of those other pieces on the retail side that have yet to sort of inflect, how are you thinking about that? Brian Moynihan : If you look across the last several weeks, the wealth management has basically been flat at that $280-odd billion level, Jim. And the consumer business bounces around, it will move $10 billion on a payday to give you a sense. But basically, the major moves are over and we're now about to around [9.35 to 9.40] on a given day. Importantly, the non-interest bearing piece going back to your generation new checking accounts seems to be stable. Much of the movement in the consumer business writ large has been for more interest rate sensitive clients with higher balances having moved and you're seeing that also slow. So we feel good about the stability of consumer at this point. And we can the deposits new accounts we're putting on today are the future of the franchise and that's what we keep building towards. So we're investing to generate those accounts that are primary accounts in the household and start with an average balance of $5,000 to $6,000 and move up to $7,000, $8,000, $9,000 over time. So feel good about it. One thing, Jim, just as you think about it, remember that we're sitting with consumer, we want to basically $750 billion in balances to the $940 billion level now, which is a significant difference in the earnings power of that business. Operator : We'll take our next question from Gerard Cassidy of RBC. We'll move next to Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Just to follow-up on this last thread of questions. Two things, one, the deposits, how much do you feel that the rate environment has impacted you in terms of the deposit growth that you've generated here and the degree of shrinkage rate that you've seen in some of the businesses? Is it rate driven, do you think? Brian Moynihan : I guess, Betsy. In the end of the day, remember that we've grown deposits for four straight quarters. What is rate driven is at the margins consumer customers that have $300,000, $500,000 have moved, have less than their deposit accounts. Honestly, the pre-pandemic, when the aggregate hole is up. So think about that. The constant customers that have been with us since then, so. And so the movement now is just pumping around based on seasonal flows of people paying taxes and people having spent money in the summer and paying down the bills from that and things like that. So we feel there's stability on the consumer side, stability on the wealth management side, including the movement of the higher end balances in the market. And a lot of that pricing on both those businesses adjusts automatically given the rate cut. And then on commercial balances, that's just evidence of the buildup of cash and corporate balance sheets and the activity levels of those customers. So we feel good across the board, and basically for several quarters in a row, we continue to grow the balances. The rate impacts really the higher end balances because remember, noninterest bearing and the consumers and low interest cost checking is driving a lot of the value and is a stable balance. Betsy Graseck : Right. And I know last quarter we were talking a lot about the sweeps and that whole pricing dynamic. Anything this quarter to say about that, reflecting on how you indicated in the slide, you're at 3.13%. It came down one basis point. I mean, it's like de minimis, right? So just the underlying question here is, are we past this whole sweep thing? Brian Moynihan : We've fully affected that through our custom basis. If that's a question asked. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And then the other question I had just was on the global banking. Alistair, you mentioned that corporate loan demand picked up late in the quarter. Maybe, you could give us some color on what's driving that. Is that mainly a function of the M&A picking up and the legs that you see to that demand would be really helpful to understand. Alastair Borthwick : Yes. So look, we've obviously seen pretty modest loan growth over the course of the past year. And it's modest loan growth that we've put in our forward NII guidance, but we were pleased to see a little bit more loan growth at the end of the quarter there. But that's why you see the balances up a little more end of period than perhaps the prior quarter and the last two quarters have been better than the previous quarters. So I don't know if that's early to call it a streak, but we're obviously pleased to see it. It's been pretty consistent across our small business, our business banking, our commercial banking clients. And I'd say we're not really seeing revolver utilization picking up yet. Probably, too early for that. Rates haven't come down that much or hadn't come down till really late in the quarter. So that potentially is a place for some upside in loan growth over time, but we haven't put that in our guidance at this stage. Operator : We'll take our next question from Glenn Schorr of Evercore. Glenn Schorr : Hi. Thank you. One quick follow-up on the NII front. I'm just curious, current duration of the securities portfolio and maybe a fixed and floating mix split, how you're thinking about that short duration as the forward curve starts to play out? Alastair Borthwick : Yes. So not a great deal of change, Glenn, for us in terms of the securities portfolio from what we said before. Obviously, the hold to maturity continues to run-off. I think it's now 13 quarters in a row, another $9 billion or so this quarter, which allows us to reinvest at higher yields. So that remains basically our first thought with respect to the investment strategy is just allow that to continue rolling down. And we're going to continue to prioritize supporting loan growth for our clients. And you can sort of see that HTM run-off over time, funding the loans growth that we've had over time. Then whatever's left over from deposits growing, we're normally putting into cash and cash equivalents or we're paying down expensive short-term liabilities. So if you look, you'd see that we've allowed about $15 billion or so of Institutional CDs to roll-off this quarter. And at the margin, we're taking a little bit of 1-year to 3-year fixed rate, maybe $10 billion or $20 billion in the last couple of quarters. But remember, we're trying to balance capital, liquidity, earnings and it's less about a rate view and it's more about just how the portfolio composition is changing over time. Glenn Schorr : Fair. Good color. I appreciate it. Wanted to maybe get a little bit more color. In the opening remarks, you mentioned the 10th straight quarter of quarter-on-quarter improvements in markets revenue. It's clear to see. Can you remind us exactly where you've been investing the lion's share of both people and balance sheet? And is that an ongoing process that we can obviously, we can't get a quarter every single quarter, but meaning, is this an ongoing capital effort to continue to boost results across markets? Alastair Borthwick : Yes. Well, look, we pointed out before and I think you see it again in our results this quarter. If you look at the organic growth highlights on Page 3, you'll see pretty good growth in each of our four big segments. Markets is no different in that regard relative to the other three and that we continue to invest in that business. I wouldn't pick out any particular area in Fixed Income or Equities for people investments. I think as Jimmy DeMare has highlighted, it's about for us filling gaps with existing clients and making sure we're there for them over time. So, we've added people across the various businesses. And then with respect to balance sheet, it's a little bit of RWAs, as Brian highlighted. It's a little bit of liquidity, allowing us to support the financing businesses. And I'd say we're benefiting from the fact that we've got a leading sales and trading franchise in each of the major elements of fixed income and equities that allows us to capture the benefits of having a diversified business with an organic growth strategy. Brian Moynihan : I think, Glenn, it's if you've been following our company for a long time and it's been 5, 6, 7 years where we started saying our position was set in the business, so we could start to grow keeping it balanced to the overall company. So that $800 billion to $900 billion of balance sheet in the market every day in the security with Jim and the team, they do a great job turning it over, managing the risk well of ours, well managed, you can see the no trading losses for many, many quarters in a row or one maybe. And so the way they're running it this long-term investment in this business requires investment around data, controls, measurement, financial reports nonfinancial reports, trade reports billions of trades a day reported. So it's a business where we think we have a very good position because of talent and the team does a good job, but it's not something we decided to do yesterday, it's about a long-term build that we've been building and growing and keeping a balance in the rest of the company, so and it continues to do good job. Operator : We'll take our next question from Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank. Matt O'Connor: Good morning, guys. I was wondering if you could talk about the outlook for share buyback. You did $3.5 million this quarter, obviously, generate a lot of capital has excess capital and sort of the outlook for loan growth is for some, but not at times, yes. Alastair Borthwick : No change to the capital strategy. Obviously, what's become very clear over the course of the past year is we've got the capital. So we built the capital over time to make sure that we were in a good position for Basel III final as originally proposed if it were put together today. And we have the time to build more over time because after dividend, you're talking about 30 basis points of capital generation every quarter. So we're waiting at this point to see the final rules as they come out. That's going to allow us to give you a much more precise answer over time. And the waterfall of priority remains exactly the same. It's number one, we got to support the clients. You saw that last quarter with the loan growth. That's always going to be our priority to support the clients, invest in the future of the business. Number two, we want to maintain and grow the dividend over time. We've added another 8% to the dividend this quarter and we want to make sure that we're in a great place to hurdle the regulatory minimum. So we feel good there. And then number three, we'll use what's left to return it to you, the shareholder. This quarter, that's another $3.5 billion. That's on top of the $3.5 million last quarter. So we're in a good position, I think, to support the future growth of the company and to continue to buy back shares over time. Matt O'Connor: Okay. And then just a different topic. You guys have talked about this concept of the normalized net interest margin of about 2.3%, now a couple of few years. Any updates on the timing of that? And then I think a lot of that is being driven by the fixed rate asset repricing. But how the lower its impact. Can you reach that level with a curve, for example? Alastair Borthwick : Yes. Well, look, the most important thing is we've got to get back to growing NII and we've been saying that now for three quarters believing that Q2 would be the trough. So we demonstrated the growth this quarter. We're in a good position to do it again next quarter. And we're on the path. We're poised to improve with NII from here. It's a grind every quarter. We've got to continue to grow the deposits. We've got to grow the loans. We've got to make sure that we think about pricing across the board. You are right to highlight we've got some attractive fixed rate asset repricing over time. We've got some reinvestment over time. And then obviously, we have to watch what goes on with the rate curve when this is a surprise like an extra 25 basis points that will flow through the entire fourth quarter, it might set us back a few weeks. But we just keep doing what we're doing. The organic growth is going to fuel the net interest income growth over time. And then NII will be an output and NII will remain our focus. Operator : We'll take our next question from Mike Mayo of Wells Fargo. Mike Mayo : I guess I'm asking the same question each quarter, but it's because the efficiency ratio seems to be getting worse. So reconciling Slide 4 with Slide 10, once again Slide 4 is your digital adoption slide, which shows 75% to 90% adoption in all of your lines of business and the trends are all getting better, so much more of a digital company. And then we look at Slide 10 and your efficiency ratio is 65% versus 64% last quarter versus 63% a year ago with non-comp expense up this quarter. So when we get back to those days when we count the number of quarters of consecutive positive operating leverage and kind of what's the disconnect here? Alastair Borthwick : Yes. Okay. So look, that's what we're focused on is getting back to that operating leverage, Mike. The pressure right now is coming largely from incentive comp related to the fee businesses. So think about sales and trading up 12%, investment banking up 18%, asset management up 14%. If you look at Wealth Management alone, we're talking about $200 million there just in that segment alone. So that's good investment and it's good return. I think if you strip that out, you see we're doing pretty well in an inflationary environment. We expect good fees from here. We expect the good expense that comes with that. And then it's about managing the rest. It's about operational excellence. It's about the digital. And as the NII shines through together with the fees and as the credit costs continue to normalize, we think we're in a good position to deliver operating leverage again. So we're looking forward to getting back to that period, and it's just about grinding out NII growth at this point. Mike Mayo : And when do you think the NII shining through will help that inflection? Is this a fourth quarter event? Is it next year? And can you give us a sneak preview for next year on what you're thinking just because it's been a little bit of a slog admittedly with the headwind from NII? Alastair Borthwick : Yes. Well, look, I think, again, this is one of those things where we got to see the deposits turn around in all of the businesses and we got to make sure that we're we've got the NII trajectory. But we kind of feel like that's going to be a 2025 operating leverage question, and we'll be able to update you, I think, with some precision as we get into the fourth quarter. Some of that's going to depend on the rate curve. We just and we'll play it by year as we go through. Operator : We'll take our next question from Vivek Juneja of JP Morgan. Vivek Juneja : Alastair, just wanted to go through the waterfall slide you had in the Q2 deck or NII. Obviously, you've got the day count and you've talked about the business hedge benefit coming on. Can you talk through the other pieces that you had on that slide since the slide was not this quarter? Alastair Borthwick : Yes. I think if you were to look we haven't updated it here because we're trying to get the 6 month forward view back at the time, and it was just helpful to do it that way. Now we're just giving the 3 months, we just figured we would give you the overall guidance. You're going to see the same component parts, Vivek, as we laid out there. So largely speaking, I'd say Q3 laid out the way that we thought it would and Q4 is setting up pretty much the same way also. We're going to get some benefit from the BSBY transition feeding back into the P&L. We're going to get some benefit from the fixed rate assets repricing over time. Some of that comes from things like mortgage, residential mortgage on our books, some of it comes from CVL. Some will come from HTM securities rolling off and reinvestment and we'll get some benefit from cash flow swaps. So that remains something that's sort of underlying all of the quarters going forward. And then the remaining piece is the part that we work so hard on. It's the growing deposits, growing low in since the organic growth showing forward and coming through in the numbers versus what happens with the rate curve. So I think as we get together in Q4, we'll probably give you a pretty good sense for what that looks like as it goes through 2025. Vivek Juneja : And Alastair, what about the two pieces? So you have had $225 million negative impact from rate cuts, obviously, more there and at the Global Markets NII. Any color on those two components? Alastair Borthwick : I'd say on the rate cuts, if you were to go back to when we provided Q3 guidance at the time we said one cut in September, one in October, one in November. And as it turns out, we all know that there were two cuts in September. That extra cut flows all the way through the fourth quarter. It's not just two weeks in the quarter or six weeks since the full quarter. So that's an additional headwind, if you like. So that obviously hurts overall. Global Markets is liability sensitive and they've continued to grow their loans. So I think if the rate cuts hurt us a little bit more in that original waterfall, you get a little bit of that back in Global Markets NII. So that probably answers those two elements. Operator : We'll take our next question from Sharon Leung of Wolfe Research. Steven Chubak : I'm calling in for Steven Chubak. Just on the security side, I know last quarter, you had laid out the repricing tailwind of about 300 basis points on securities, a little bit less on the loan side. Can you just give us an update on what those figures fit today? Alastair Borthwick : Yes. I'd say I just used probably 250 on the securities, probably 250 on the mortgages, probably 100 on the CVL, that probably gets you in the right ballpark shared. Steven Chubak : Perfect. And then just another quick follow-up on the securities portfolio. I know you guys are seeing some repricing tailwinds there, but have you ever given any thought on like doing a bigger repositioning action just because the market seems to be responding favorably to some similar actions of some of your peers? Alastair Borthwick : So at this stage, we don't see any need for that. Remember, most of our securities in the available for sale. We've got those held at this point in treasury swap to floating. And we feel like if you look at the NII sensitivity of the company over time, it's come down with the composition of our portfolio. So we feel like we're in a good position at this point to grow NII, grow earnings and we obviously start with a very good base of liquidity and capital. So no plans to reposition any at this point. Operator : We'll take our next question from Erika Najarian of UBS. Erika Najarian : I appreciate that you want to wait until January, Alastair, to give us NII update given how much is changing or how much has been changing in the curve. So maybe I'm going to ask this this way. You've talked about hedges in the past in terms of the sensitivity of your floating rate loans, specifically in commercial. As we think about forecasting for whatever rate curve turns out and we think about your floating rate loans ex card, should we assume a similar sensitivity or on the way down is on the way up excluding BSBY? Or will the hedges, essentially give you some floor and that your sensitivity to repricing going forward, again, ex BSBY is not as significant as it was on the way up? Alastair Borthwick : Yes. So I think it's okay to start with the same sensitivity on the way down as up because the company is largely speaking positioned in the same way. At the same time, you put your finger on it, we are going to benefit from repricings over time. And we mentioned last quarter and we've talked about already on this call the fact that we've got the various securities and the various new originations that replace those loans that are maturing. So that remains the case. And then we've got some cash flow swaps, a number of them are pointed against the commercial. And as we particularly as we get into the third quarter and fourth quarter of '25, you you'll see a benefit in commercial yields there because those ones are at lower rates and they will be repriced in Q3 and Q4. So a little bit of cushion there. That's one of the reasons that as we look forward into NII, we can sort of see how this repricing that's taking place remember, we're coming off of a period now with a long period, 15 years, of a very, very low set of yields. And we're coming back now to something where you can really see the full value of our deposit base. And it takes a while. It's quarter-by-quarter. We just got to let it develop over time. Erika Najarian : And my follow-up question is, clearly, you have one of the best views on deposit behavior in the US. And it's been so long since we've seen a neutral rate that's not zero. I guess it\u2019s a two part question. The first is, should we similarly assume the same ability to recapture, on deposit repricing on the way down as it was on the way up in terms of the same deposit beta? And as we think about 2025 that may have better loan growth, where do you think if we if our neutral rate is 2.75%, 3%, where does Bank of America's natural deposit costs fall relative to that? Brian Moynihan : Erika, I think you have much discussion over the last couple of years about betas and everything. But if you look where we sort of stand at the end of Q3, the difference between fed funds and the total interest bearing cost of our deposits is around 250 basis points, almost 260 basis points. If you think if you looked at Q2 in '19 when the fed funds hit the highest rate in the last cycle, that difference was 160 basis points, 170 basis points. So there's a fund what you're pointing out, leave aside betas and everything else, there's a fundamental difference of 100 basis points in spread against the interest bearing side and we take the noninterest bearing piece that obviously has a bigger impact. So this will settle in, but you are right for the -- and you've been around this industry for a long time. So if you go back and think about when the Fed's funds rate was sustained in the 2.75%, 3%, 3.25% level, this industry was able to make more money due to the extra value of relative to the last 15 years of the noninterest-bearing deposits in the consumer businesses and the small business in the core commercial business and wealth management business. So we feel good about positioning. We feel good about our deposit makeup, which is driven by core operating activity, the primary household and the consumer side the operating accounts and the businesses, the small businesses and even the wealth management. So see you will see more value. I'm confident and that's what we're looking forward to as the rate structure settles in. And so the key to your point, is not the path of '25 of whether the cuts come in one quarter or another quarter. The key that I think is different is the blue-chip economists, your economists, I'm sure and our economists they all predict that we'll end up with a terminal rate at a 3% level as opposed to the past cycles where we didn't ever get there and rates were starting to be cut at the end [19]. Operator : And we'll take a follow-up question from Gerard Cassidy of RBC. Gerard Cassidy : I apologize for missing that earlier queue. Alastair, you touched on the Basel in one of your comments regarding how you're good position from your capital standpoint from the original proposal. Can you give us any color on what you guys have seen from that presentation that Vice Chair Bar gave earlier in the quarter, what your views are -- where you might come in? I think they said there was an average increase of capital for the group of about 9% and how you might stack up against that? Brian Moynihan : Yes. I'm not sure we have enough detail, Gerard, to give you a specific at this point. When the reproposal comes out, what we're told is it will not only be about it repropose the whole entire picture, including the changes outlined by Chair Bar speech, but you could take up for granted that, that was more favorable than the original proposal. So therefore, we'll benefit from it. And once we see something that's a little more detail, we might be able to give you a better estimate, but it's favorable to us. Gerard Cassidy : I see. And Brian, do you think that could step up your activity of returning more capital as it comes in better than expected, you would take that as an opportunity maybe to return more capital to shareholders? Brian Moynihan : In the end of the day, we have excess capital based on the estimates of the old one. So yes, it would at the margin. But remember that at the end of the day, Gerard, we are sending capital back to shareholders because of the fact that the franchise generates activity without using a ton of capital and grows its loans, in deposits, the earnings, et cetera. So we will continue to be discipline with the capital and the capital return, and we'll continue to return more of it if more is available, we're sitting with a fair amount of excess over the current set of rules. And if a new set of rules are more favorable than the original proposal that would set us up better, no question. Gerard Cassidy : Great. And then just as a follow-up, you guys have been building out your obviously branch banking system throughout the country in markets in which you don't have a big presence. Can you just give us an update on how that is progressing? And what are you seeing that makes you -- because you've got great consumer numbers, you got great read on your customers. What really makes you guys excited that this is really the way to go, a combination of the digital and these branches? Brian Moynihan : Well, I think if we look at markets, we just celebrated 10 years in Denver from the first opening, which is the first among the first five markets we went after. And so if you look at this market, as I always look at the FDIC data and you kind of look at it last couple of years, it's kind of chopped up because of the stimulus and everything. But you see continued progress by us in all these markets moving from nowhere to into the 10th, 7th, 8th and we keep building that out. What that does is we believe in high touch, high-tech across all individuals and even small businesses and even a little bit in the middle market. And what we mean by that is for even wealthy customers, there are times when they need to utilize a branch. And if you have no branch in Denver or Columbus or Indianapolis or Minneapolis or etcetera, it's a little hard for them to get the full experience. So, we've done that. Now, as we think about it, we had extreme discipline. We're going after this to build out markets to a level we feel comfortable that we have the market covered. And so, instead of putting one in every place, we're trying to build out a network in a place like Columbus where I think we have 15, 20 branches now. And that allows us to build the business. We already have a major Merrill presence there. We already had commercial banking presence there. This allows us to build underneath it. And so that's why you're seeing our deposits in those branches push past $100 million per branch, which is much different than we see in others doing it because of density and capacity and the digital and the prior customer base for lack of a better term that we now can get more from. So, the team is doing a good job. We expect you have to go down both paths, but at the end of the day, we're trying to get coverage in the top markets across the country so that we cover the American population in an efficient and effective way. And the truth of the matter is even though we're 54% sales across all the businesses in consumer all different types of products, a lot of the checking sales only digital are about in the 30s as opposed to the 50s, which means people still like to walk in a branch and start a relationship and that's why we're there. Operator : And this does conclude today's Q&A. I'd like to return the call to Brian Moynihan for closing comments. Brian Moynihan : Thank all of you for joining us. We operated well in the quarter delivering $6.9 billion of earnings after tax, $0.81 a share. As we told you, we continue to see good health in asset quality overall and good spending behavior by the consumers consistent with a solid economy. We told you a couple of things in the past that NII would hit an inflection point in the second quarter. It's done that. We told you that we continue to see the ability to drive operating leverage in the future. Now we can see as NIA starts to pick up and that will drive the efficiency ratio and operating leverage. We continue to grow organically across the board and we continue to return capital to you as we did $3.5 billion this quarter. So, thank you and look forward to talking next quarter. Operator : This does conclude today's Bank of America earnings announcement. You may now disconnect your lines and everyone have a great day.",

Later, you will have the opportunity to ask questions during the question-and-answer session. Please note today\u2019s call will be recorded. And I will be standing by should need any assistance. It is my pleasure to turn the conference over to Lee McEntire. You may begin. Lee McEntire : Good morning. Thank you. Welcome, and thank you for -- coming to the call to discuss our fourth quarter results. Our earnings release documents are available on the Investor Relations section of the bankofamerica.com website. And they include the earnings presentation that we'll make reference to during this call. I hope everyone's had a chance to review the documents. Our CEO, Brian Moynihan, will make some opening comments before Alastair Borthwick, our CFO, discusses the details of the quarter. Let me just remind before we start that we may make forward-looking statements and refer to non-GAAP financial measures during the call. Forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and the assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause our actual results to materially differ from expectations are detailed in the earnings materials and the SEC filings available on the website. Information about non-GAAP financial measures, including reconciliations to U.S. GAAP can also be found in our earnings materials that are available on the website. So with that, I'm happy to turn the call over to Brian. Brian Moynihan : So good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Before we begin today, I just want to express our deep concern for our communities, clients, and teammates impacted by the California wildfires. Our top priority, of course, is ensuring the safety and welfare of our team and helping our clients and customers. Our imperturbable Market President Raul Anaya is leading our team out there. We have teams on the ground assisting in any way we can and are monitoring of the situation to extend support and resources. So far, we have activated our Client Assistance Program, donated $1 million in disaster relief to the American Red Cross, additional contributions to the L.A. Food Bank and the L.A. Chamber of Commerce Small Business Efforts. With that, let's turn to earnings starting on page two of the presentation. This morning, we reported $6.7 billion in net income, that is $0.82 in EPS for the fourth quarter. That was a solid finish to another good year at Bank of America. We grew revenue on a year-over-year basis in every category in quarter four. We saw good loan and deposit growth, and Alastair is going to walk you through some of the details of the quarter in a moment, but I want to thank our team for another great year. For the full-year of 2024, we generated $102 billion of revenue and reported net income of $27.1 billion of EPS of $3.21. We produced 83 basis points return on assets and 13% return on tangible common equity. We generated these results working from a strong balance sheet that allowed us to support clients and economies continue to grow. The economy appears to be now settled into a 2% to 3% GDP-type growth environment. It has healthy employment levels in the resilient consumer. The immensity of the American consumer can be seen in our data. So far in the first two weeks in January, they're spending money at 4% to 5% clip over last year, similar to what they did in the fourth quarter. In our business side, the clients are profitable, they're liquid, and seeing good productivity. We ended the year with $953 billion in liquidity. We also ended with $201 billion of regulatory CET1 capital and a CET1 ratio of 11.9%, leaving us nearly 115 basis points of excess capital as we begin 2025. For Bank of America, the year was characterized by a few important highlights that played out as expected and were consistent with our communications to you throughout the year. First, we saw net interest income bottom out at $13.9 billion on an FTE basis in the second quarter of 2024. We ended the year with a fourth quarter on the same FTE basis at $14.5 billion, then that was a bit better than we expected. This obviously provides a great starting point for 2025, and based on the assumptions Alastair is going to discuss a little later, we should report record NII in 2025. So how did we do that? We drove organic growth in all the businesses, and that we have highlighted on Slide 3. We saw continued growth in net new checking, new households, new companies, and commercial banking growth in our institutional markets business. This organic activity enabled us to grow loans and deposits at a pace we believe is to be ahead of our industry average and our peers. A key for us, obviously, is a growth in our deposit franchise. If you look at Slide 4, you can see we've now grown deposits for six consecutive quarters. In the most recent quarter, we saw growth in consumer balances and stability around non-interest-bearing balances across all the businesses. We continued to price in a disciplined manner, and rates paid moved lower this quarter across the board. Overall, rate paid on deposits moved from 210 basis points in the third quarter to 194 basis points this quarter. And we're lower in the fourth quarter, we're lower in every business segment. On the loan side, consumer loans grew in every category-linked quarter. Commercial loan demand continued to build off the strengths we saw in the third quarter of 2024, and commercial loans grew 5% year-over-year for the fourth quarter, and a much faster annualized pace when comparing the third quarter to the fourth quarter of 2024. So back to Slide 3. In our wealth management business, we added 24,000 new households in 2024. We ended the year with $6 trillion in total client balances that we manage for people in America across our global wealth and consumer businesses. Our consumer investments team, what we call Merrill Edge, crossed a new milestone this quarter and now sits in excess of $518 billion in balances. Investment banking gained share of industry revenue in 2024. Our sales and trading team put up the 11th straight quarter of year-over-year revenue growth and achieved a new full-year record of nearly $19 billion in revenue. As the quality stabilized and remained strong, with net charge-offs declining modestly from third quarter. Early in the year, we highlighted that our expectation on consumer credit is that they would stabilize to normal level. And on commercial office losses, they would trend down during the year. We saw both those trends continue into quarter four. On the expense side, we continue to invest in our franchise. And even though spending increases in brand, people, and technology, and strong fee growth, which drove incentive and transaction processing costs higher, we managed to create operating leverage in the fourth quarter. Our digitalization and engagement expanded across all our businesses. We saw more than 14 billion logins to our digital platforms in 2024. Our Erica capability surpassed 2.5 billion interactions from its inception. And our CashPro app surpassed $1 trillion in payments made through the app in 2024. It's also worth noting that digital sales in our consumer product areas crossed 60% in the fourth quarter again. You can see all these trends in our industry-leading digital disclosure on Slides 26, 28, and 30 in the appendix. All the success in balance sheet straights allowed us to deliver more capital back to our shareholders. We returned $21 billion of capital to the shareholders in 2024, which was 75% more than 2023 and included an 8% increase in the common dividend. So in summary, for both the fourth quarter and for the year, we enjoyed good profitability, we drove healthy returns, we saw good organic client activity across all the businesses, we continue to manage the risk well and increase the capital delivered back to our shareholders. And we positioned ourselves well for growth in 2025. I want to again thank my team for continuing to drive another year of responsible growth. And with that, I'll turn it over to Alastair. Alastair Borthwick : Thank you, Brian. And I'm going to start on Slide 5 of the earnings presentation, because it will provide just a little more context on the quarter. For the fourth quarter, as Brian noted, we reported $6.7 billion in net income or $0.82 per share. And before we talk about comparisons between periods, I just need to remind you that our fourth quarter 2023 GAAP net income number included two notable items. In the fourth quarter of \u201823, first, we recorded $2.1 billion of pre-tax expense for the special assessment by the FDIC to the industry to recover losses from the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, and that reduced EPS last year by $0.20. Second, we recorded a negative pre-tax impact to our market-making revenue of approximately $1.6 billion related to the cessation of BSBY as an alternative rate, and that reduced earnings per share last year by $0.15. So when you adjust for the large FDIC assessment and the BSBY cessation charge, fourth quarter \u201823 net income was $5.9 billion or $0.70 per share. On Slide 6, we note some of the highlights of the quarter and we reported revenue of $25.5 billion on a fully taxable equivalent basis, up 15% from the fourth quarter of \u201823. And if you exclude the fourth quarter \u201823 BSBY cessation charge, our revenues grew 8% year-over-year. As Brian said, all the revenue items are showing improvement year-over-year. NII grew 3%. Investment banking grew 44%. This quarter, our $4 billion of sales and trading revenue marked a fourth quarter record, and it grew 10% from the year ago period. And investment brokerage fees rose 21%, with both assets under management flows and market levels contributing nicely to the growth. Our card income and service charges grew 7%. Non-interest expense was $16.8 billion and was up when adjusted for the FDIC special assessment driven by incentives paid for the strong revenue growth as Brian noted and the related activity costs that comes with that. Expense also included additional investments in people, technology, and brand with some major partnerships announced recently. And it included what we expect to be the peak in quarterly costs associated with enhancing our compliance costs and controls. The good news is we created operating leverage in the quarter. Provision expense for the quarter was $1.5 billion and was consistent with the previous two quarters. And lastly, returns in the fourth quarter were 80 basis points of ROA and 13% return on tangible common equity. Back to the balance sheet on Slide 7. We ended the quarter at $3.26 trillion of total assets, down $63 billion from the third quarter, driven by seasonally lower levels of client activity in global markets, while loans across the businesses grew $20 billion in the quarter. Otherwise in the quarter, the investments of our excess liquidity saw a $9 billion reduction in hold to maturity securities. And at the same time, the combination of shorter-term liquidity investments of cash and available for sale securities increased $28 billion. On the funding side, total deposits grew $35 billion on an ending basis as both interest bearing and non-interest bearing grew. Long-term debt fell $14 billion driven by net redemptions and valuations, and global markets funding declined in line with assets. Liquidity remains strong with $953 billion of global liquidity sources. That is up modestly compared to the third quarter, even as we paid down some debt and retired some preferreds. Shareholders' equity was flat at around $295 billion. And within all of that, we returned $5.5 billion of capital back to shareholders with $2 billion in common dividends paid and the repurchase of $3.5 billion in shares this quarter. Tangible book value per share of $26.58 rose 9% from the fourth quarter last year. Turning to regulatory capital, our CET1 level improved to $201 billion and the CET1 ratio rose to 11.9%, remaining well above our new 10.7% requirement. Risk-weighted assets increased modestly as increases in loans were mostly offset by lower RWA supporting our global markets client activity. Our supplementary leverage ratio was 5.9% versus a minimum requirement of 5%, which leaves some capacity for balance sheet growth, and our $460 billion of total loss absorbing capital means our TLAC ratio remains comfortably above our requirements. Let's turn to Slide 8. We can go a little deeper on loans by looking at average balances. And loans in the fourth quarter of $1.08 trillion improved 3% year-over-year, driven by solid commercial loan growth. Overall, commercial loans grew 5% year-over-year. And importantly, this included an 8% drop in commercial real estate loans. Commercial loans excluding commercial real estate grew 7% year-over-year, and the consumer loans grew modestly both linked quarter and year-over-year. As Brian said, on a linked quarter basis, every category of consumer lending grew, and you can see that at the bottom of Slide 8. If we turn our focus to NII performance and use Slide 9, regarding NII on a GAAP, non-fully taxable equivalent basis, NII in Q4 was $14.4 billion. And on a fully taxable equivalent basis, NII was $14.5 billion. Several quarters ago, we signaled our expectation that NII would trough in the second quarter of 2024 and begin to grow from there. And this represents now our second quarter of NII growth. And we expect that growth to continue in 2025. In fact, if you look at the two quarters after the inflection point, NII is already growing at a 5% rate. Fourth quarter NII on a fully taxable equivalent basis increased by $399 million from the third quarter, driven by a number of factors. First, it was led by improvement in deposits across the businesses. And even as deposit balances increased linked quarter, our interest expense on those deposits declined by $600 million. Loan growth and fixed rate asset repricing also benefited us again this quarter. With regard to a forward view, interest rate expectations continue to drive volatility and predictability, but we'll provide some thoughts for future NII. We expect to start the year in the first quarter with NII modestly higher than the fourth. Remember that the first quarter has two fewer days of interest and that's roughly the equivalent of about $250 million of NII equivalent. So even with that, we expect to grow modestly. Then we expect that growth to increase through the year to the point where it could be 6% to 7% higher in 2025 than 2024. We expect to exit the year at least $1 billion higher in the fourth quarter and that would put us in a range of $15.5 billion to $15.7 billion on a fully taxable equivalent basis, and that's obviously significantly higher than the Q2 '24 trough of $13.9 billion. I have to note the following assumptions. First, we assume that the current forward curve materializes. And while the interest rate curve has changed significantly over a fairly short period of time, as of the 10 of January, the curve was expecting only one rate cut in 2025 that may come in May or June. Based on our more recent growth experienced, we're assuming loan and deposit growth in 2025 that's higher than 2024, and more consistent with growth in a 2% to 3% GDP environment. The other elements of anticipated growth in NII expected are the benefits of asset repricing as fixed rate securities and loans and swaps roll off and those get repriced at higher rates. And those themes all remain consistent with our prior conversations with you in the last several earnings calls. With regard to interest rate sensitivity, on a dynamic deposit basis, we provide a 12-month change in NII for an instantaneous shift in the curve, above or below the forward curve. And on that basis, a 100 basis point increase would benefit NII by roughly $1 billion, while a decrease of 100 basis points would decrease NII over the next 12 months by $2.3 billion. Lastly, note that our slide showing the trended investment of excess deposits is in our appendix. It's on page 21. Deposit levels grew to $870 billion over loans at the end of Q4, and that's an incredible source of value for shareholders. And $649 billion, or 54% of our excess liquidity, is now in short-dated cash and available for sale securities. The longer-dated lower-yielding hold-to-maturity book continues to roll off, and we continue to reinvest in higher-yielding assets. Okay. Let's now turn to expense, and we'll use Slide 10 for the discussion. We reported $16.8 billion in expense this quarter. And the fourth quarter of '23 included the large FDIC special assessment charge and excluding that, expense increased. The increased expense from prior periods was driven by a number of factors and was partially offset by a roughly $300 million release of prior period accruals for the FDIC special assessment. Let's talk about the drivers of the expense. First, in regard to revenue, our markets-related businesses of investment banking, investment in Brokerage and Sales & Trading, those were up 20% year-over-year. Incentives for the firm were up 15% versus the fourth quarter of '23 and were in large part related to these market-related revenue streams. On investments that we made, we added bankers and advisers across most of our businesses in 2024, and we also increased investments in our brand with significant sponsorships like the Masters in FIFA to name a few. And we increased our investments around technology as well as financial centers. This quarter alone, we added 17 financial centers with nine of those in our new expansion markets. We're a growth company, and we continue to invest in our future. As far as head count goes, we've managed our head count carefully, and we've held it fairly flat through the 4 quarters of 2024 at around 213,000 people. Lastly, we incurred additional costs to accelerate work on compliance and controls. As you likely saw in late December, the OCC issued a compliance consent order to Bank of America, and that's a result of exams done more than a year ago. This orders about correcting or enhancing certain deficiencies in some aspects of our processes that existed at the time. The order doesn't limit any of our growth plans and the order acknowledges we began taking corrective actions before the order was announced. And as a result of the work in process, we increased our resources substantially in the second-half of 2024 and those costs are already embedded in our quarterly run rate. Okay. Let's go back to expense and how to think about a forward view. First, most importantly, we remain focused on growing the company and driving operating leverage. Second, we expect the first quarter to include some normal seasonal elevation and we believe this amount will be roughly $600 million to $700 million, primarily for payroll tax expense. So we think $17.6 billion is a good number to expect for Q1 and before seasonally declining in Q2. And that's all part of our expectation that expense should be roughly 2% to 3% higher in 2025, compared to 2024. Let's now move to credit and turn to Slide 11, where you can see net charge-offs of a little less than $1.5 billion, improving modestly compared to Q3. That's the fourth quarter now that net charge-offs are around $1.5 billion. We've seen consumer losses in a pretty stable range of $1 billion to $1.1 billion over those past few quarters. And on the commercial side, we saw losses of $359 million, which is down from the third quarter, driven by the continued decline in commercial real estate office losses. Net charge-off ratio this quarter was 54 basis points, down 4 basis points from the third quarter. We don't see overall net charge-offs or the related ratio changing much in 2025, without much change in current GDP or the employment environment, we expect the net charge-off ratio to be in the range of 50 to 60 basis points of loans for 2025. Q4 provision expense was $90 million lower than Q3 at $1.5 billion as reserve levels remain constant. And as it relates to reserve levels on a weighted basis, where reserved for an unemployment rate a little below 5% by the end of 2025, and that compares to the most recent 4.1% rate reported. On Slide 12, we highlight the credit quality metrics for both consumer and commercial portfolios. And there's nothing really noteworthy here that I want to highlight on this page. So let's move to the various lines of business starting on Slide 13 with Consumer Banking. That business made nearly $11 billion or 40% of the company's earnings in 2024. In the fourth quarter, Consumer Banking generated $10.6 billion in revenue and $2.8 billion in net income. Both grew modestly from the fourth quarter of '23 as fee improvement for card and service charges is now being complemented by the growth in NII. Consumer Banking continued to deliver strong organic growth with high-quality accounts and engage clients and they achieved a new record of client experience scores in December. The organic growth activity noted on Slide 3 includes more than 200,000 net new checking accounts, which now takes us to six years' worth of quarter-after-quarter growth. And we show another strong period of card openings and investment account growth. Investment balances grew 22% to $518 billion with full year flows of $25 billion and market improvement throughout the year. Expense rose 8% as we continued investments in our business. The biggest story in consumer this quarter is deposits because these are the most valuable deposits in the franchise. And in the last six months, we believe we've seen the floor begin to form after several periods of slowing decline. Consumer Banking deposits appear to have bottomed in mid-August at around $928 billion and ended the year at $952 billion on an ending basis. Looking at averages, you can see then the deposits grew $4 billion from the third quarter to $942 billion, all while our rate paid declined to 64 basis points. Finally, as you can see in the appendix, page 26, digital adoption and engagement continue to improve and customer satisfaction scores rose to record levels, illustrating our client appreciation of enhanced capabilities from these investments. On Slide 14, we move to Wealth Management, where the business had a very profitable year, generating $4.2 billion in earnings from nearly $23 billion in revenue. In 2024, our Merrill Lynch and Private Bank advisers added another 24,000 net new relationships. And the professionalism of these teams earned them numerous best-in-class industry rankings as you can see on Slide 27 in the appendix. With a continued increase in banking product usage from our investing clients, the diversity of revenue in the wealth business continues to improve. The number of GWIM clients that now have banking products with us continues to grow. And at this point, it represents more than 60% of our clients. Importantly, about 30% of our revenue remains in net interest income, which complements the fees earned in our advice model and those have also grown. Net income rose 15% from the fourth quarter of '23 to nearly $1.2 billion. In the fourth quarter, we reported revenue of $6 billion, growing 15% over the prior year and led by 23% growth in asset management fees. While expenses were up year-over-year, they grew slower than revenue creating the operating leverage in the business. Business had a 26% pretax margin and generated a strong return on capital of 25%. Average loans were up 4%, driven by growth in custom lending, securities-based lending and a pickup in mortgage lending. Deposits grew 2% from the third quarter, and the teams were quite disciplined on pricing of those deposits. Both Merrill and the Private Bank continued to see strong organic growth. And that helped to produce excellent asset under management flows of $79 billion this year, reflecting a good mix of new client money, as well as existing clients putting money to work. We also want to draw your attention to the continued digital momentum that you'll find on Slide 28. Because, for example, three quarters of Merrill bank and brokerage accounts were opened digitally this quarter. Slide 15 shows the Global Banking results and this business generating $8.1 billion or 30% of the company's earnings in 2024, and it continues to be the most efficient business in the company at less than 50% efficiency ratio. The business saw a nice rebound in investment banking fees in 2024, which we expect to continue in 2025. In Q4, Global Banking produced earnings of $2.1 billion. Pretax pre-provision results were flat year-over-year as improved investment banking fees offset lower NII and higher expense. The total earnings were down 13% year-over-year, driven by higher provision expense that came as a result of prior period reserve release. Investment banking fees were $1.7 billion in Q4, growing 44% year-over-year. This was led by mergers and acquisitions. We also saw strength across debt capital markets fees mostly in leverage finance and in equity capital markets fees and we finished the year strong, maintaining our number three investment banking fee position. The fourth quarter saw a strong momentum as the election results provided a lift to sentiment for a more pro-business climate and expectations for more deals to be completed. Expense in this business increased 6% year-over-year, driven by the 13% growth in non-interest income and continued investments in people and technology. The balance sheet saw good client activity, and it was muted somewhat by the strength of the U.S. dollar. Year-over-year flatness in Global Banking loans includes this foreign exchange impact and a $6 billion decline in commercial real estate from paydowns. Otherwise, loans in Global Banking were up 2%. Deposits have been growing for many quarters now with our commercial and corporate clients. And total global banking deposits are now up 10% year-over-year, reaching a new record. So we're seeing strong growth across all the categories from our corporate and commercial clients all the way from the larger end the business banking on the lower end. And we also saw a 10% growth in our international deposits. Turning to Global Markets on Slide 16, I want to focus my comments on results excluding DVA as we normally do. Our team continued their impressive streak of strong revenue and earnings performance. They achieved operating leverage, and they continue to deliver a good return on capital. For the year, record sales and trading results of nearly $19 billion grew 7% from 2023 and they've been growing consistently now on a year-over-year basis for almost three years. This led to $5.7 billion in full-year profits and represents more than 20% of the company's full-year results. In the fourth quarter, earnings of $955 million grew 30% year-over-year. Revenue and again, this is ex DVA, improved 15% from the fourth quarter of '23, as both Sales & Trading and Investment Banking fees improved nicely year-over-year. Focusing on sales and trading ex DVA, revenue improved 10% year-over-year to $4.1 billion. This is the first time we've recorded more than $4 billion in our Q4 results and it included Q4 records for both FICC and Equities. FICC grew 13%, while equities improved 6%, compared to the fourth quarter '23. FICC benefited from tighter credit spreads as well as increased volatility in interest rates, while equities benefited from increased activity around the U.S. election. Year-over-year expenses were up 7% on revenue improvement and our continued investment in the business. And then on Slide 17, you can see all other with a loss of $407 million in the fourth quarter. We spoke earlier about the fourth quarter \u201823 charges for BSBY and the FDIC special assessment charge. Their reversal impacts the comparisons on revenue, expense and net income in this segment. Otherwise, there really isn't anything significant to report here. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 6%, and excluding discrete items and the tax credits related to investments in renewable energy and affordable housing, the effective tax rate would have been approximately 26%. Looking forward, we expect the tax rate for 2025 to be in a range of 11% to 13%. And this just includes our expectation for higher expected earnings in 2025 and relatively stable tax credits. Finally, this quarter, on page 18, we thought it was important to summarize some of the guidance points we talked through this morning, and we hope you'll find this page helpful. So in summary, we're looking for a strong growth in NII, and we'll look to both continue important investments in the franchise and drive operating leverage as we grow throughout the year. We aren't expecting much movement around credit based on a pretty solid economic outlook. And we remain with a very strong balance sheet with excess capital that we can deploy to grow the business and deliver back to shareholders as appropriate. So with that, I'll stop there. I thank everybody, and we'll open it up for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Steven Chubak : Hi, good morning, Brian. Good morning, Alastair. Brian Moynihan : Good morning. Steven Chubak : So wanted to start off, Alastair, with maybe unpacking some of the drivers of the NII growth in '25. How much of the build that you're guiding to is attributable to loan growth versus some rate or repricing tailwinds, runoff of legacy swaps, what have you? And does that acceleration in NII you cited for the second-half continue into '26 given some of those tailwinds should remain in place beyond '25? Alastair Borthwick : Well, first of all, I admire you asking about '26. I'm always reluctant to talk about the back half of '25. So I'll leave '26 for another time. But we don't have a whole lot of news, Stephen, relative to what we talked about in the prior quarters. We're obviously pointing right now to deposit growth in particular because it's beginning to get back to something more normal. There was a period there where deposit balances were declining as people got back to something more normal in their accounts. But we're highlighting here consumer found its floor in August, wealth found its floor in July. And that's giving some support then as we grow deposits. That's helping us with the NII growth. So that hasn't changed. It's just that now we've got successive quarters of growth that we can actually point to. The loan growth that you asked about is interesting in that -- there were several quarters there where we were bouncing around flattish on loans. In Q2, we added $9 billion of loans. In Q3, we added $19 billion. In Q4, we added $20 billion. So the loan growth has picked up a little bit. We can sort of see a little more optimism with clients, a little more activity, a little more demand from clients for loan growth. So those two things, a little more confidence around deposit growth, a little more confidence around loan growth, those obviously compound through the course of the year. So that will help us in the back half of '25. And then as you pointed out, we're still a beneficiary of the fixed asset repricing. That comes from some of the old loans that are on our books that come off in 2025 and we reprice. And then we've got some cash flow swaps that also will mature through the course of the year. So that's what leads us to this idea of we think the NII growth will accelerate to 6% to 7% and for the full-year. So a little bit of it -- a little bit faster in the back half of the year, we kind of just see that, but that's what gives us the confidence on NII. Steven Chubak : That's great, Alastair. And maybe a follow-up for Brian. Just at a recent conference, you spoke about the expectation of delivering 200 bps of sustainable operating leverage, laying out an algorithm where revenues grew 4% to 5%, expenses grow 2% to 3%. What gives you confidence in that ability to deliver that level of top line growth on a sustainable basis? Just want to unpack that a little bit further. Brian Moynihan : So I think what gives us confidence, we have periods with stable rate environment, a stable economy, growing at a slower rate than it is now. And having produced that for five years in a row, I think it was by quarters or something like that. And so it's not something we haven't done. But if you think about the current environment, what's driving is different. Our revenue growth is growing at twice that rate plus and the expense growth is growing close to that number. But when you get to higher growth rates, especially where it's coming from Wealth Management business, market-based business, businesses in investment banking, it attaches a higher sort of instantaneous expense. And yet it still produces even a little bit of operating leverage at a higher growth rate, a good after-tax, a good EPS result, a good net operating income results. So there's different times, different models. This is a model where revenue is growing faster than it might grow all the time in more normalized environments, but the business is coming from are those businesses which have the quickest move relative to expense. Giving you an example of that of the normalized last year's expense and think about our expectations from '23 to '24 and you look at the growth rate, a big part of the growth rate in expense about 45% to 50% of it is the incentives to the wealth management teammates, which is a good thing. And so that means revenue is growing, and we're taking about half of that in. And if you look at the other pieces added to that. So Steven, it's simply put, we did it before. We know we can do it. You can see underlying setup. And as you see NII kick in the consumer business, which is more incrementally profitable because of NII, you see that kick in and you see the expense base there flattening out. And you see the revenue base of the company broaden out, you'll see that we'll get back to the operating leverage that we expected, albeit it may be a little slower year-over-year growth rate unless you're going to tell the market, it's going to go up 25%, 30% every year and drive the wealth management. When that slows down to a more normal growth rate that will slow down its expense growth rate also, therefore, you'll see the opening up at that level. So it's not something we make up. It's something we put in our operating principles and it's something we have done a lot of quarters, but we have to sort of get the stability in the relative business position. Steven Chubak : That's great color. Thanks so much for taking my questions. Brian Moynihan : And Steve, the easiest thing to think about is headcount. At the end of the day, our costs are all people, and that's been relatively stable, and that will start to flow through because during the course of last year, we basically kept the head count relatively stable. We had some offbeat expenses that we had to deal with, but now we're sort of settling into that 213,000 level people with the takeout on stuff through operating excellence and putting in on stuff into quiet coverage, expanding our pipes to draw more marketing, more client coverage, more technology investment. So we always are shifting expenses, and that's how we make that operating leverage happen. Steven Chubak : That's a really good point. Thanks for the additional headcount nugget, Brian. Much appreciated. Operator : We'll move next to John McDonald with Truist Securities. Your line is open. John McDonald : Hi, good morning. Wanted to ask as a first question, just a follow-up to Steve's NII questioning. Alastair, is the deposit growth in the model that you've laid out the year being used to pay down more expensive funding? You've talked about the ability to kind of self-fund balance sheet growth. And then also, is there any sense of the yield pickup you get on the swap roll off and replacement that you could give us kind of ballpark on? Brian Moynihan : John, before Alastair starts, I welcome back from the cold to be able to be back in coverage and covering our company, and it's always good to know that you're going to consistently ask about NII, but I'll turn it to Alastair to give you that. John McDonald : Thanks, Brian. You got to be typecast. Alastair Borthwick : There you go. So I think your first question was if we get the deposit growth we anticipate, do we think we'll use some of that to pay off some of the higher cost liabilities on the balance sheet? The answer is yes. That's consistent with what we said in prior calls. We've done that. If you look at the other institutional CDs, you'll see they came down by another $7 billion this quarter. So as we grow the really high-quality parts of the deposit franchise that allows us to take those down. And that's one of the things that's going to help grow net interest yield on an ongoing basis. It's not NII accretive necessarily, but it helps us with net interest yield. So that remains a part of the strategy, John, you'll see that continue. As it relates to the cash flow swaps and how those reprice? No, we typically don't lay out the table of what we've got on and how it reprices over time, but it is embedded in our guidance. So each quarter, when I give you guidance for the next quarter, that will incorporate what we know is coming off on the cash flow swaps and how that does. The other fixed rate assets you can kind of see in our supplemental information just based on the originations of resi mortgage, the originations of auto loans. And every time, obviously, we're booking new residential mortgage and old residential mortgages coming off, we're picking up 250 basis points every time there. So you can see that happening each time you pick up the supplemental. We just don't tend to disclose the cash flow swaps. So I will do that for you each quarter as we go through the year. John McDonald : Okay. And then just to switch topics so Brian doesn't make fun of me. Brian Moynihan : That's all right, John. That's all right, John. Just kidding. John McDonald : Now in terms of capital, how are you thinking about the CET1 target and the buffer that feels appropriate in this environment? And how does that play into your thinking on buybacks? Brian Moynihan : So I think we bought $3.5 billion this quarter. We'd expect to continue to step back at the highest levels, we are in the money, we pay the dividend, we invest in the growth of the business, and then we use the rest of buyback stock. That was $3.5 billion in the past couple of quarters. So at this earnings rate, that seems level that makes sense. We're 11.9, we think at a 10.7 requirement, a buffer of 11 -- 50, that's 11.2. Obviously, there's going to be some sort of changes in the capital rules, and we'll have to settle it after we see that, and we hope some relief in the volatility of the CCAR outcomes, because remember that last year, we jumped quite a bit without a lot of correlation to the actual risk of the company and stuff. So we'll -- hopefully, we'll see that settle back in. John McDonald : Okay. Does that leave you towards a mid-teens ROTCE target, Brian, as NIM normalizes and capital normalizes? Brian Moynihan : Yes. I think the capital normalization will be more sort of holding that capital to grow through it and not have to retain more capital for growth, frankly, if there's math that helps us favor it. But the NIM is probably more critical to move the yield from sub-2% this quarter -- 2% this quarter to 10-plus at the end of the fourth quarter and then moving from there. That, as you know, is -- all that flows the bottom line. So we'll continue to drive the RTC back up as -- if you look back in the areas where there was any front-end. Fed funds was 2%. We were running a couple of hundred basis points more. It's the huge zero interest deposit base, especially in consumer and low interest deposit base that provides a lot of leverage. So that will be a driver. The capital return would help some, but I think that will be more complex based on all the different rules and what happens. John McDonald : Got it. Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Your line is open. Glenn Schorr : Hi, thanks very much. I have a relative question on trading. I know how impossible it is to predict really the environment. But you took share in investment banking, and you've invested and gotten benefits from that. You have invested in trading. So maybe it's a weird question because you just put up record revenues in FICC and equities, as you mentioned. But when we see good environments like this, some companies tend to really blow out numbers. You guys have zero loss days, tend to blow out numbers. Is that a comment about gaps in the business mix that you'd like to invest more and fill in? Is that a comment about risk tolerance? I'm just curious how to think about it on a relative basis? Brian Moynihan : I think you have to back up -- Jim Demar and the team are driving the business, 11 straight quarters of year-over-year growth. Frankly, I'm not sure any other company comes close to matching that. So other people have more volatile up and down in your prospecting. But over a course of time, we just want us to keep walking up the ladder and they've done a great job of doing that, continuing to drive the business. In fact, if you look at year-over-year comparisons because your point was obviously something we asked ourselves, we looked at the last 48 hours, here 24 hours, basically, a lot of people in the same range as opposed to fourth quarter where some people's last year's fourth quarter was down a lot in the prior year. Ours was more stable. And I think last year's fourth quarter was one of the highest fourth quarters we ever had. And then we put another 10% plus growth on top of it. So think of us as being that business that just is imperturbable, just keeps commonly growing forward and driving itself up without having maybe some of that more traditional trading house up and down. Not because we're not good at. They're very good at it, not because they aren't getting share because, frankly, if you look at the last three or four years, I continue to gain share, it's just we have a little less volatility in principal activity on a given day. Glenn Schorr : Okay. I appreciate that. This might be a simple follow-up, but on your comments when talking about credit and reserves, you reserve for unemployment a little bit below 5%. We're 4.1% now. I think that's the way this cycle has played out, I think that's typical BofA conservatism. I think that's the accounting. But I guess my question is your reserves will be fine, your P&L will be fine, but if that plays out, does that completely change how we're thinking about the pickup in consumer spending, overall loan growth, things like that? Because that is -- we're talking about just the next four quarters? Brian Moynihan : Yes. This is where you got, Glenn, you got to kind of get away from reserve setting methodologies versus what we really believe is from our research team and your research team, your economics research team would tell you. Our core assumption is the GDP grows in the low 2s this year. The unemployment stays between 4.1% and I think -- maybe gets up to 4.3%, something like that. So this is literally a weighting of a base case, which would match that in an adverse case and some other cases just in the way we build methodologies for the reserves because you're reserving for uncertain future, and that's how it has it. I don't take it as a thought that we really believe we're going to see 4.8% unemployment in the next four quarters. And so\u2026 Glenn Schorr : Well, I hope with that all I want to appreciate that. Brian Moynihan : Yes, thanks, good Operator : We'll move next to Erika Najarian with UBS. Your line is open. Erika Najarian : Yes, hi. Good afternoon, about to be good afternoon. My first question, just as a follow-up. Brian, I think I heard you say in response to John's question that you think the exit rate, net interest margin will be 2.1%, I think in 4Q '25, I just wanted to confirm that I heard that correctly. And underneath that, Alastair, could you talk about the repricing or down deposit beta dynamics that you would assume to get to that net interest margin? Brian Moynihan : Yes. So the simple answer is you've stated what I stated to John, but I'll let Alastair answer the second part of the question. Alastair Borthwick : So generally, Erika, we're obviously following the Fed rate cuts just repricing things accordingly. There are I think two things going on right now that are interesting. The first one is, generally speaking, in the commercial businesses with the higher-end deposits. We're typically following the rate cuts and just going down 25 basis points. Obviously, at the other extreme on the noninterest-bearing, there's nothing we can do with that. It's already noninterest bearing. But we're following the Fed cuts, we're moving the rates with discipline accordingly. And then the second thing that's going on is there was some rotation going on over the course of the past 2 years, where there have been a lot of things going from noninterest-bearing into interest-bearing across the different parts of our businesses. That has slowed significantly. So you look at, for example, consumer noninterest-bearing, that seems to have bottomed out in February of last year, and the noninterest-bearing balances are growing now again. So that rotation is slowing also. Both of those things are factoring into our guidance. Brian Moynihan : Yes. So Erika, if you look at the interesting part, that's gone on in the last couple of quarters just from a deposit behavior. If you look at our accounts that were here prior to the pandemic to now, you saw a run-up and then you saw a little depletion and it's basically stabilized at a level. But if you look at it in the aggregate, all the depletion is actually driven by the highest balance accounts, like 250, 500 average balances million and the others are still multiples of where they were before, that's been going on, and they've been growing, and they're growing 9% year-over-year in the lower balance accounts as people make more money in store more cash and have cash flow. So if you think about what had happened is our average balance count was around 7,000, went up to 11,000, and now it's basically stable at 9,000 checking accounts, and that's kind of -- and you can grow out from there. That is very valuable because checking is either zero or very low interest. And so it's where the growth we see coming as deposits grow in consumer that helps produce irrespective of the market dynamics or the higher at the market price deposits where you see the impact of the deposit franchise coming through. So consumer being down 1 basis point quarter-to-quarter doesn't sound like a lot, but you got to remember a lot of the stuff, it doesn't really price but are they growing that stuff? And each $10 billion of growth in that area is very important to us. Erika Najarian : Got it. That's very helpful. And just as a follow-up, both you and Alastair have during -- over the course of 2024, started introducing the concept of a normalized net interest margin of 2.3%. With the neutral rate maybe around 4%, does -- can BMA get there more quickly, particularly given the deposit dynamics that you mentioned, Brian? I guess I'm trying to -- we're just trying to figure out, you guys did introduce the concept of normalized NIM. So I'm not trying to seek out guidance in terms of '26 or '27 or whatever, but you had to have told us that for a reason. And I'm just wondering if the forward curve or what the dynamics are that would lay out the path to achieve that over the medium term? Brian Moynihan : If the Fed funds rate stays higher, we'll get there faster. Simple because that's obvious because the sheer volume of loans. So if we were sitting here in the October, I think when we're talking about that, the amount of rate cuts was still, I don't know how many more -- 3 or 4 more than we've had so far, and now we're down to 1. So as it stays at a higher nominal rate, you'll see this adjustment come through. There are two caveats at. One is we're carrying a larger markets balance sheet, which, by definition, is a little less robust in that area. And then secondly, we're carrying a lot of low -- a lot of excess liquidity just because we're running that down as Alastair said. So during -- you have the buildup after -- during the pandemic, we built up a lot of term financing and running off. So all that will help us. But it will go faster than we'd otherwise say mid last year to now just because the nominal rate environment stays higher. Erika Najarian : Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open. Mike Mayo : Hi, so you kind of upped your NII guide for the next several quarters. And this was the first question asked. But how much is short rate? How much is long rate? But most importantly, how much of this is a little bit more states in the yield curve? And what part of the yield curve is most important for that? And what's the sensitivity for every 10 basis points of additional steepness that add how much NII are bumping along those lines? Thanks. Alastair Borthwick : So Mike, it's still the short term that drives probably 90% of the sensitivity around NII. Because if you think about it, we just don't have enough fixed rate assets repricing to really drive NII. In any given quarter, you've got a few billion of resi mortgage, a few billion of CVL repricing, let's call that 10 to 12. You've got $8 billion to $10 billion of hold to maturity securities repricing. But that's in the context of a $3.3 trillion balance sheet. So it's still the short-term that drives most of the NII. So when Brian says, obviously, we're helped by the fact that there might be two or three rate cuts less than they were previously. That's obviously helpful. But the big thing is always for us in terms of year-over-year growth, it's always about deposit growth and loan growth. The fixed rate asset repricing is turbo charges a little bit at the margin but it's about deposit and loan growth, and those are the important ones. And getting back to growth now in each of our businesses, gives us a stronger foundation, leading into 2025, than we had this year when we still had at the beginning of the year, consumer coming down wealth coming down. Now that they found the floor is slightly different. Mike Mayo : Got it. And then a big picture question. Brian, with the new incoming administration and a different tone as it relates to bank regulation. In fact, the incoming Treasury Secretary said he would like to reinvigorate, thanks. So if you were talk to them and maybe their listening, what would you like to see changed as it relates to bank regulation? And then a specific question, I know it's going to be tough. If you give me any sense would be great. But your CET1 ratio, if you didn't have gold plating, if you had a level playing field, if you took out some of the extraneous operating risk penalty, how much would your CET1 ratio increase in that sort of world? Brian Moynihan : So Mike, I think your second question brings up. The places that our industry, our company have been advocating heavily is that we've had a little bit of a situation from the pre-pandemic to-post pandemic where you've seen capital -- required capital go up nominally 10%, 15%, 20%. And not a big change in the risk of the companies. And that is to all the mathematics behind all the counting, right? And so we're saying, oh, well, wait, we aren't indexing the G-SIB. So therefore, our relative size economy isn't growing as fast as it was intended to be indexed on that basis, isn't there. You've had, as you said, sort of accretion of sort of methodologies that keep pulling more in, including the stress test volatility that we've all pointed out to them. And then -- and the last point you make it is if you look at this concept of Basel III making equivalent around the world is completely off in a different world because we're using advanced -- excuse me, the rest of the world is using advanced. We're using standardized gold plate or whatever you want to talk about, it's just apples and oranges. And so I would never think that we go -- and we ever got to Europe, our numbers would be probably a big -- a lot higher, but that's not going to happen because just we're going to have -- we as a society have a more conservatively capitalized industry. So I think it's simply put if they were to take into account our clear statement -- our clear advocacy about as an industry about index take the volatility out of CCAR, how can it change so much in the relatively same scenario. And also, behind the scenes, all the changes in accounting, not a counting, but accounting for risk you're increasing capital requirements and without an explicit decision to do so. And we think that, that would be worth probably 100 basis points or so. If you really sat back and thought about it, how do you get there, Mike? Think about our volatility in CCAR outcomes, I think we went from we want to buy, I don't know, 50, 70 basis points last year, whatever it was. The risk of the company didn't change. As a matter of fact, it probably went down, honestly. And so that's what we're working on. So we want to see that. And then in a day-to-day supervision, we just want to see people focused on safety and soundness and good management and making sure there's the regular agencies cooperate on things like BSA and AML and things that -- everybody is all over the place, and the industry is trying to sort it out in the middle. And we've given precise points to look at, and we'll see what happens. Mike Mayo : All right, great. Thank you. Operator : We'll move next to Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global Securities. Your line is open. Jim Mitchell : Hey, good afternoon. Maybe just dialing in on the deposit growth, you clearly have been outperforming the peer group. But maybe just want to focus on consumer for a second. You generated 1.1 million of net new checking accounts, which seems best among peers. I think that's showing up in better consumer deposit growth in 4Q. So, what do you think you're doing differently that's generating that kind of consistent success in adding new accounts? Brian Moynihan : Look, at the end of the day, our brand is best received. You know, in terms of our scores, our customer service capabilities are scoring at the highest they've ever come. The fairness of our account structures, the transparency, the digital capabilities, it's just winning in the market. It's in a billion net new checking accounts and not -- you know, 92%, 90%, whatever they are, are primary. They start with an average balance of 2,000 to 3,000. They move to, you know, 6,000, 7,000 over the course of, you know, six months. This is just a great job done by Dean Athanasia and Aron Levine and Holly O'Neill that run this business for us, just continue to drive it. Then, on top of that, we've layered in ways with various business lines to help generate accounts. So, our work we do with companies to offer our best products and services as a benefit to their employees helps us generate some extra growth. Our ability to do business around college campuses, which is not huge for, you know, this quarter's growth. But because we're generating the amount of openings at twice the rate of young people exist in society for our customers five years ago, five years later the people are out working and they're great customers. So, it's a whole bunch of things. So, it's relentless and sustainable, you know, and yet, we still have lots of ways to grow. And we weren't in -- you know, we just entered a lot of markets over the last five years, you know, Denver, Cleveland, Columbus, Cincinnati, Indianapolis, Minneapolis, Milwaukee now, Lexington, etc. That's one way. And then, if you think about in wealth management teammates -- and Katy Knox and Lindsay and Eric do a great job there, but we have a lot of room to go where we continue to outfit those clients with a full range of services at Bank of America. And even Merrill Edge has a lot going on there. So, there's a fair amount of deposits that come from our Merrill Edge originations, which are 300,000 accounts year over year. And, you know, those are all $100,000 starting accounts, not $3,000. Jim Mitchell : Right. That all makes sense. And then, maybe pivoting on the expense side, the guidance of 2% to 3% growth, you know, it's kind of a pretty decent step-down for what we saw in the back half of the year. So, what areas do you see sort of slowing on the expense side given the, you know, your optimism on organic growth? How do you kind of decelerate the expense growth in '25? Brian Moynihan : I think three key things. One is if we get the year-over-year growth in the markets-related businesses, you know, in the high double digits, you know, 20% growth, you know, that expense guidance might be a little tight. But again, you would cheer for that. So, this is assuming a 5% to 6% growth in the S&P type of numbers. So, that takes some of the growth pressure off. The aggregate numbers are, you know, locked in at a high level and growing from there. And then, the second thing is, frankly, just getting, you know, a lot of this work behind us, and some of the remediation and look-backs and things are all completed and behind us. And then, you know, third is just keeping the head count and continuing to focus on OpEx and generating capabilities. And so, you know, as we stepped into some of these national brand campaigns around some of the major properties we've affiliated with -- most recently, yesterday, the U.S. Soccer, including men's and women's teams, FIFA, the Masters, these are all things we're paying by just driving other efficiencies. So, from a company that, you know, for years has gone down in expenses, the idea of growing 2.3 is not that hard a concept, albeit the growth in the back half of this year was a big -- you know, driven by the incentive explosion that happened, you know, because of the explosion of markets. You know, when they took off, our teammates did a great job of capturing revenue and incentives on. Jim Mitchell : Okay. Yes, no, that's fair. Thank you very much. Operator : We'll move next to Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Vivek Juneja : Hi. I have two separate questions. First one, with expenses, just want to clarify to the last question, Brian, what you said. So, what are you assuming for incentive comp in '25 in your guidance? Is it flat year on year? Are you assuming some increase? Any color on that? Brian Moynihan : It would grow -- it would grow with the markets and stuff that we have other efficiencies and offsets under that growth. Vivek Juneja : Okay. Second one, I guess, I can't leave you disappointed. I must -- given you and Alastair love NII, so let me ask a little nitty question on that. BSBY hedges, since those started to accrete this quarter, how much was the benefit this quarter? And what is the cadence of that as we look out over '25? Alastair Borthwick : So, we think about the BSBY accreting back into the P&L, kind of like the same way we do with the other cash flow swaps, Vivek. So, I'd say a couple hundred this quarter. And then, when we give you the guidance with all the cash flow swaps, it's all included in there. So, when I say that we think this year, Q1, should be up modestly, that is after the 250 million of day count adjustment. And it's including deposit growth, loan growth, and all the cash flow swap activity. Vivek Juneja : Okay. So, that's 200, a couple of hundred million. That -- probably, given that it's a 1.6 billion to be recovered over a couple of years, that should continue at this pace all through '25 then, right, at least that particular item? Alastair Borthwick : Most of it will take place in 2025. It sort of burns back into the P&L. And then there'll be a little bit in 2026 and a tiny bit in '27. Vivek Juneja : And then, sorry, if I may, another one. Brian, to your comment on capital, you said you want to keep a 50 basis-point buffer, your CET1 for 11.9; 50 basis points, 11.2. Is there a plan to go down to the 11.2 at some point and, therefore, step up your buybacks, or what's the thinking there? Brian Moynihan : I wouldn't assume that we're going to take it down through, you know, buybacks in your modeling. It's got to be there to support growth. But, Vivek, the simple answer, we've got to get a set of rules that could move in around on us. And once we get them, then we can give you better guidance on that. Because, you know, it's just hard to estimate when, you know, you could have more excess if they -- you know, what I -- we, as industry, expect them to do, and then we have a different conversation. Right now, we'll probably grow part of that away through the good work of our team in terms of loan growth. And in the markets business, we continue to invest in that business. So -- you know, so don't expect us to deplete that ratio down, you know, quickly. But -- you know, but I'm holding my right to change that if we get the capital level straight down to the new rules. Vivek Juneja : That makes sense. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Brian Moynihan : Hey, Matt. Matt O'Connor: Hi. Thanks for taking my question here toward the end. Just if there was some relief on capital, are there areas that you would incrementally lean into? Obviously, without knowing all the rules, it's hard to know for sure. But just are there areas that you're like, you know, if you have that extra 100 basis clients, or if it's 50, or 150, you would do a little bit more in some areas than you have been. Brian Moynihan : Yes. None of our businesses are constrained because of, you know, capital. So, if the consumer team had, you know, more credit card loan growth that was based on what they think the right risk balance is and getting paid for it, etc., that's gone on. You saw us just grow balances last quarter out of loans or whatever. And so, I think it -- you know, I don't see that. Wealth management, obviously, not much of a RWA user in a lot of ways. And then, you know, the real question is -- in a global banking business, again, if they get strong loan growth there's nothing that we're slowing it down. In the markets business, we continue to drive the capital up, being the lowest return on equity business we have. We have to be a little careful that we don't do it. But Jim and the team had done a great job. And we've -- basically, the balance sheet is $300 billion larger than it was four, five years ago. And they've grown -- you know, we've grown through the G-SIBs, as you know, from 2.5 to 3, and, you know, we'll keep probably growing through those and that we use some. But it's not like we'd say you can't have it because of capital. It's really just running the company and keeping the balance and the overall management of the risk and where we want to take risk and how we do it. You know, and then, frankly, it's -- you know, they come up with business plans that we've never had to say we don't have enough capital to do that. That's not the issue. Matt O'Connor: And I guess, so depending on how the capital rules are tweaked, it could make some businesses just more profitable, right? Even though you have enough capital to put to those businesses, if the returns aren't making your hurdles -- you know, maybe it could with some tweaks. You know, I've heard some of your peers talk about equity prime brokerage as one area that could have higher returns if capital requirements are reduced. Again, we don't know exactly how it's going to play out, but do you envision any kind of changes to how you evaluate businesses? Thank you. Brian Moynihan : Yeah, I think it won't change how we evaluate businesses because regulatory capital is only one of the ways we look at it. We look at the risk and sort of market-based capital and other things. But it could take the sort of, for lack of a better term, a little bit of the penalty to some of these businesses down some. But you also have to remember the ROA and the mix of businesses, and there's another side to this because we have 6%, you know, tangible common equity, and we got to produce returns on that, and low ROA of businesses affect that. So, there are things that will favor it under regulatory capital but not favor it under sort of market-based disciplines. So, we work through all that. I don't expect to see change in how we do it, but also don't think that any of our businesses are constrained because we're not having capital. So, if Jim and the team have a chance to go prime brokerage and make it work, in our company, we can have other businesses which have very high ROAs to make up for it. In some other companies, it'd be more important for them because they don't have those other businesses, you know, in relative size in the markets business. Matt O'Connor: Okay. Thank you. That was helpful. Operator : We'll move next to Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Your line is open. Gerard Cassidy : Hi, Brian. Hi, Alastair. Brian Moynihan : Hi, Gerard. Alastair Borthwick : Hi, Gerard. Gerard Cassidy : Brian, hey, we've talked about this in the past and also with you, Alastair. Obviously, credit quality for you and your peers has been -- is very strong. And in view of the rate cycle we just came through, where we went from zero to plus 5% at the short end of the curve and really never soar a surge in charge-offs due to rates going up that much, when you guys look at credit quality, is it due to better underwriting standards, or sticking to your underwriting standards, or is it your customers themselves because we all went through the pandemic? Are just much stronger balance sheets more resilient? What would you account for, so far, that this credit cycle has been fairly benign for you and your peers? Alastair Borthwick : Yeah, look, it's definitely been benign. I think one thing that hasn't changed -- our underwriting strategy, our standards, our risk appetite, our client selection, those really haven't changed, Gerard. But I think you're right. Things are obviously different than 2019. 2019, we didn't have this rate structure. So, that's a little bit harder at the margin for the consumer. At the same time, the consumer is stronger. We can see that in the deposit balances. We can see it right now in the consumer spending in the 3% to 4% range. We can see it in the balances being elevated over five years ago. We can see it in the unemployment level, the income level, home prices, wealth effects. So, look, 2019 was freakishly low in terms of like a historical norm. But things have settled in here. We sort of said a year ago, we thought they would plateau right around where we are. We're glad to see three or four quarters now with some stability. It feels pretty good on the consumer side. It feels very good still on the commercial side. So, that's why we're sort of laying out. Our expectation is unless there's a big change in the economy, we think we're going to be around in this 50 to 60 basis points over the course of the next year or so. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And then, as a follow-up, you know, I share your optimism on the outlook for the economy and many of your peers in the capital markets business. I think many investors do. What are the risks? I mean, when you guys sit down at night and, you know, everything's going well, what do you talk about as what curveballs do we have to watch out for? Is it a rate environment that changes quickly without anybody really expecting it? Is it complacency? What are some of the risks that you guys think about? Brian Moynihan : Well, you have wars and hopefully a resolution of one that's just happening as we speak. But we have wars, you have trade wars, etc., that bothers. You have the availability of resource around the world, whether it's physical resource or human resource, to do work and shortage of that because unemployment rates in a lot of countries are pretty low. And so, can you get the productivity to keep growing the economy? You know, but -- all the usual things. But if you think about it, you know, Gerard, just to be clear, we've seen a 15-year run, you know, from after the pandemic -- excuse me, after the global financial crisis or more, year run, where you've seen constantly improving, you know, credit statistics that then interrupted in the pandemic a little bit and then because of the stimulus dropped down again and now it's back to normal. But that's a long-term trend. So, it's not complacency. It's just that how much leverage is building up in the system that there'll be difficulties with, either at the household level, at the corporate, at the company level. And then, you know, a lot of it's outside the banking system. So, we worry about that and how it reverberates into the banking system because just leverage that exists out there at higher levels than we traditionally have given. And the banking system still affect us because that means if people can't carry it, they'll be restructuring the companies and bankruptcies and things like that, which are going on today, but they're going on a level which is very manageable. So, we worry about all those things and, you know, the federal debt levels and the pinch that will come out of state and federal spending that they need to slow down the growth. All those things are factors which we think about. And the way we manage the company is to run it so that, given those events, we can continue to operate. And that's why the stress testing, quite frankly, is a good thing because it makes you think about the parade of horribles happening, even though they don't happen, and make sure that you are positioned to survive them. And, you know, if you said to -- the question Alastair answered, one of the big impacts across time here in the banking industry is because the top 30 institutions are doing stress testing, which assumes that you're wrong in your underwriting and the economy goes, you know, from 4% unemployment to 10% employment overnight -- unemployment overnight. You know, think about the impact of that on bringing the underwriting narrower so that you can afford that capital that you have to hold for that outcome even though that outcome hasn't occurred. That's going across a big portion of the banking industry. So, I just think it's more fundamentally structured, but leverage is going to be the issue. It always is, and you're always trying to find the P, Where is the excess leverage, and how do you make sure you're avoiding it? Gerard Cassidy : No, that's very helpful. Thank you. And, Alastair, I liked your comment about when you were talking about the 17 financial centers that you're a growth company. Hopefully, that will be reflected in the P/E shortly. Alastair Borthwick : Well, there's plenty of room on the P/E multiple, but I'll let you work on that, Gerard. You work on the E part. Gerard Cassidy : Okay. Fair enough. Thank you, gentlemen. Alastair Borthwick : Thank you. Operator : And we'll take our final question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Betsy Graseck : Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks so much for taking my question. So, Brian, here's the question. You know, small business optimism is up, and you've got a flat curve at the front end. And so, I'm kind of wondering how that feeds into C&I demand. And I'm wondering what your conversations with not only small business, mid-business, corporates, it'd be really interesting to hear how you think they're preparing for this change. Thank you. Brian Moynihan : Sure, Betsy. So, small business -- small medium-sized businesses -- so in our business banking category in our -- so we have small business, business bank, and we have, you know, global commercial banking, and think middle market. Across that environment, the draw rates and lines of credit stuff are still much lower than they were in a pre-pandemic and things like that and to hire some more people when the payroll dynamics of that, whatever it is. And they might permanently finance that, but immediately, they use lines. And the draw rates, you know, 400 basis points over where it normally runs, so to speak, which means that they're drawing at less rate. And that probably means they're doing a little less. And so, we haven't seen that move a lot. That's a to-come in terms of loan growth, as Alastair mentioned earlier. But their optimism has changed, and you saw that -- you know, and that's really around the other things. When you talk to our small business customers, and we made these points to, you know, people in Washington is the over -- you know, the regulation, the impact, the hard -- it's hard to do business, hard to get things done, you know, the rules coming out, they don't have the big, you know, staffs that, you know, we do and other companies do that can deal with all that. And so, it all confuses, it slows them down, it makes them hesitate. Their belief is that that's change. And that's why you see the optimism come up. And then, we got to translate that optimism into activity. And then, you'll see the long growth come. But I think it's a quick change, and it's based on their view of how easy it will be for them to get things done, both at the both at a state and federal level. Betsy Graseck : Yeah, I'm just looking at you or Bank of America is one of the few that actually has small business loan growth year on year. And I know a lot of that came a couple quarters ago. But with this very sharp increase in small business optimism, I would think that could potentially be something you could benefit from. Brian Moynihan : No -- no question. And so -- but the real dollar volume of benefits going to be, you know, the small business loans I think grew -- you know, have been growing quarter after quarter, year over year for a good chunk of time now. And, you know, we feel good about that. But the dollar volume change in the middle market business from a little more drawing on the lines consistent to what people have done before is a lot of loan balances. There's $200 billion of balances in that business, so it doesn't take a lot to kick it up. Betsy Graseck : Right. I got that. Brian Moynihan : So, I think, look, we're the largest lender to small business, and those customers tell us they're optimistic and they see forward. And the issues were, I did -- \"I couldn't get enough people.\" And that's something we've got to be careful of. \"The regulations were hurting me.\" And then the interest rates -- and the interest rates coming down a little bit helps them. And the other two, the strong belief is that'll be more readily available. Betsy Graseck : Thanks so much. Appreciate it. Operator : And it does appear that there are no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn it back to Brian for any additional or closing remarks. Brian Moynihan : Sure. Well, thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We finished 2024 with good momentum as we enter '25. The economy is resilient and healthy. The consumers continue to spend a solid and healthy rate. The employment levels are strong. The asset quality we can see is very good. Our loans have now grown for several quarters in a row here. Deposits have grown for 6 straight quarters. The rate environment continues to be constructive. And then the added value in the last couple of quarters is the fee business have come on strong, given the extra market activity. All that sets us up well for 2025. Thank you for your support. We look forward to talking to you next time. Operator : This does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time, and have a wonderful afternoon.",
