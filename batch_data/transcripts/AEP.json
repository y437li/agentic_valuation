Fleishman \u2013 Wolfe Research LLC Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the American Electric Power First Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session; instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded. Your hosting speaker Bette Jo Rozsa. Please go ahead. Bette Jo Rozsa : Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the first quarter 2014 earnings webcast of American Electric Power. Our earnings release, presentation slides and related financial information are available on our website at aep.com. Today, we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors. Joining me this morning for opening remarks are Nick Akins, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Tierney, our Chief Financial Officer. We will take your questions following their remarks. I will now turn the call over to Nick. Nicholas K. Akins: .: And second I would maintain that the cause of the initiatives previously implemented by the company, regarding improved capital allocation to transmission in the operating companies focused on process improvement activity, such as lean in our power plants and wires business and the development of our unregulated generation business. We would not have been successful in capturing the value of the off-system sales benefits from the extreme weather and market conditions as a result of the polar vortex. I can give you several instances that it was impaired that the cultural initiatives that have \u2013 and still the teamwork and ingenuity paid off to ensure our generation was available to the benefit of our shareholders and our customer. Before Brian and I get into the details of the quarter, let me go over the headlines for the quarter and for the reminder of the year. AEP earnings for the first quarter both GAAP and operating came in at a $1.15 per share compared with $0.75 GAAP and $0.80 per share operating for first quarter 2013. Because of the strong results, and after review of cash flow and earnings metrics for the reminder of the year, we are increasing our 2014 guidance for 320 to 340 per share to 335 to 355 per share. We are reaffirming guidance for 2015 and 2016 in the 4% to 6% earnings growth rate based upon the original guidance given in 2013. We will continue to monitor the fundamentals in particular, load and energy markets along with the progress of our previously announced initiatives to announce any further guidance detailed during the EEI financial conference in the fall. Additionally, as we mentioned to you in our last earnings call, if we were to get ahead from a cash and earnings perspective we would reinvest from cash flows and retained earnings and more transmission and move projects from 2015 and 2016 into 2014 to elevate pressures that exists in those later years. Because of the excellent operations of our plants and continued focus for our employees regarding continuous improvement we are able to do just that. Consequently, AEP will invest $200 million more in the transmission projects that was identified in the green area of my second most favored graph, a transmission graph that you\u2019ve all seen previously and we will also move $60 million to $70 million of 2015, 2016 spending end of this year. There is still a lot more work to be done because we are not counting on increased load or capacity market revenues that\u2019s not the way we are running our business. I\u2019ve said before our business is now an optimization business and one in which we continually adjust the changing conditions to ensure discipline and execution, that drives consistency for our share holders and value for our customers. Even though we now have the wins that are back somewhat because of first quarter results, our focus will not change. We will continue our capital allocation approach defined earlier, thoughtful prioritization and control of O&M expenses, continued development of our unregulated business and the continuous improvement and cultural initiatives. The implementation of lean activities and other continuous improvement initiatives continue to produce expected results and we are pleased with the progress our employees continue to make in this regard. This effort will not slowdown because this now engrained in our decision making and how we do business and this progress will not be jeopardized because we all know that one quarter does not make a year and it certainly doesn\u2019t make three years. On the regulatory front we have filed the PSO rate requesting $45 million of additional revenue focused on infrastructure and AMR meter investments as well as SPP related transmission charges. Interveners have filed testimony asking for varying levels of reductions and hearings are set for June and we expect an order by the end of the year. We have filed in West Virginia and FERC to allow the transfer of half of Mitchell Plant to Wheeling power to provide needed capacity and energy to serve Wheeling customer load. Hearings are set in August in West Virginia and the FERC case commoning period ends in May. So everything is on track with the remaining Mitchell transfer. We have also filed in Virginia for the biannual rate review, while we are not asking for a rate increase because our ROEs within the statutory bandwidth, we are seeking some rate adjustments within customer classes and a requested ROE of 10.52%. Hearings for this case have been set for September. I would also like to point out the progress that has been made with the capacity construct within PJM. The FERC has agreed with PJM on many of the capacity auction adjustments that AEP support as well to enable the recognition of the value of steel in the ground generating assets within PJMs footprint. These changes were not completely adequate, our moves in the right directions and not only enable a more balanced portfolio of resources, but also maintain the integrity and reliability of the grid particularly at times of extreme stress being such as with the polar vortex. Just as in this side I had previously reported 89% of coal units slated for retirement in mid 2015 ran during the polar vortex that is also true for the quarter. But another interesting titbit is that these units ran at substantial 46% capacity factor during the quarter. So the need for this coal capacity was not just an abrasion, but an integral part of the maintaining comfort for our customers during the extreme cold weather. The capacity market changes are important because this capacity construct also defines the revenues and price signals for investment as well as the bandwidth around the volatility of energy prices. Wind energy prices move as high as $1,800 megawatt an hour, this should be an indication that capacity markets are not operating properly. This is bad for investment resources, ultimately bad for the reliability of the grid and certainly bad for the customers in the end. We are also pleased that Congress in now getting involved with hearings in the house and senate to shed some light on the confluence of pending an existing EPA rules, electricity and natural gas coordination, physical and cyber security issues related to the grid, and capacity market issues. All of which impact the resiliency of our country\u2019s electric supply to fuel the needs of our customers and the economy. Now, after my favorite graph, which I typically call the equalizer graph on page \u2013 this is page four of the presentation. We will go through and set through some of the stage that they were looking at here. As far as overall looks like were 9.9% and that\u2019s close to the 10%, we expect that to improve. We\u2019ve got from an Ohio power perspective, I know it's showing 13.1%, but that includes some non-recurring items particularly in seed adjustments and transmission through related cost. That will bring that down to that \u2013 below that 12% allowed to return threshold with the seed test, so that\u2019s going to come down. APCo continues to improve, we \u2013 and certainly two jurisdictions there from the Virginia standpoint were in good shape, I talked about that earlier. For West Virginia we will plan to file a rate case this year because of the returns there in that jurisdiction. We have current ROE range of 10% to 10.9% in West Virginia, but we\u2019re certainly underperforming there from an ROE perspective. So we will file a rate case there.  : PSO is in the midst of a rate case as I mentioned earlier, so we expect that outcome by the end of the year. So that will be an opportunity for us as well. SWEPCo continues to have the issue of the part of the capacity of Turk that was slated for Arkansas and they continue to work on ways which to deal with that situation and other areas like transmission cost and other measures to improve the ROE there. So we expect that to come up. AEP Texas includes a securitization, so it always showing high that the 13.7%, but also has considerable customer growth, so it just staying there pretty steady. And then AEP Transco , Holdco we continue to invest heavily in that area, so you will see the return there show up lower than what actually is the authorized and actual returns there in that part of the business. So and we intentionally will drive more investment in that area is evidenced by the $200 million I talked about earlier. So but that\u2019s a good story and we will continue to do that. So it really shows that the benefits of been able to properly allocate capital and work on the operating company side of things to ensure that we are improving from an ROE perspective. So we feel pretty good about where we said from a regulated results perspective, they are all strong and that provides the foundation for our business. So after an excellent quarter as we look at the reminder of 2014 and into 2015 and 2016 we\u2019ll be looking for following sensitivity is in our modeling in earnings to expectation. First, the continued weather adjusted effects on load forecast in each customer category which Brian will talk about little bit later, energy prices with the peer would be increasing but not clear given the lack of long-term liquidity in the market shale gas related growth in the service territory which Brian will cover in detail, continued progress on process improvement initiatives which continue to move forward in the company in a very positive way. Additional transmission capital allocation opportunities that may exist, rate related activities as we mentioned earlier and certainly the unregulated business from the cost side and the revenue side. I'm reminded of an old adage that says that is better to be lucky than good, we at AEP believe there is much more desirable to be good and lucky I know you Pittsburgh Penguin fans checks blue being one of the them may not like this. But I recently attended the most recent Columbus Blue Jackets Pittsburgh Penguin playoff hockey game. Columbus initially had trouble controlling the puck and quickly fell behind in the first period by 3 score and look like it was going to be a long night. But was focused on the fundamentals with discipline and execution scored a goal in each period we won the game in over time. In the old adage good speaks of the fundamentals and lucky speaks of a free option that cannot occur if the fundamentals were not present AEP is focusing on the fundamentals and the rest will take care of itself that\u2019s the story of the first quarter of 2014. Over to you Brian. Brian X. Tierney: Thank you, Nick. And good morning everyone, on Slide 5 you\u2019ll see our comparison of 2014 results to 2013 bisegment for the quarter. As we announced last fall at the EEI Conference we have adjusted our earnings presentation to align with our big business segments following our corporate structuring. The segment reporting detail for the first quarter of 2014 and pro forma for 2013 can be found in the supplemental information package posted on our website and in the 10-Q that we plan to file later today, the recently completed corporate separation provided the occasion for us to define segments with make our reporting simpler and more transparent. For the company overall operating earnings for the first quarter were $560 million or $1.15 per share up $0.35 per share compared to the $387 million or $0.80 per share recorded last year. Generally the year-over-year improvement was realized across all segments and was driven by new rates that reflected our increased customer focus investment strong generation performance that captured high prices for wholesale power and high weather related retail sales. With that as an overview let me step you through the major earnings drivers bisegment on Slide 6. Earnings for the vertically integrated segment were $0.57 per share up $0.16 per share compared to the first quarter of 2013 significant drivers include customer focus investment and our utilities that resulted in rate changes across many of our jurisdictions adding $0.08 per share for the quarter. In addition the effect of extreme weather winter temperatures improved earnings by $0.07 per share heating degree days were 25% higher in the East and 30% higher in the West when compared to last year. Higher wholesale power prices and strong performance by our generation group bolstered off-system sales which benefited shareholders and customers the higher off-system sales improved earnings for this segment by a $0.11 per share while customers across several of our jurisdictions were realized $74 million through margin sharing mechanisms the year-over-year increase in retail and wholesale margins were partially offset by higher O&M, depreciation and other items. The increase in O&M adversely affected the quarterly comparison by $0.03 per share due to a favorable insurance settlement recorded in 2013 and higher employee related costs, somewhat offset by lower storm expenses. The higher depreciation expense resulted from increased investment in plant reducing earnings by $0.02 per share. Finally, other items in total were off by $0.05 per share, primarily due to higher cost from PJM that we\u2019re not covered through regulatory tracking mechanisms. The transmission and distribution utility segment results were also higher than last year by $0.02 per share driven by positive rate changes and extreme weather in Texas. The Transmission Holdco segment continues to grow adding $0.02 per share for the quarter, reflecting our continued significant investment in this area. From March of last year to March of this year, this segments net plant grew by nearly $1 billion an increase of 99%. The Generation and Marketing segment had a strong quarter adding $0.15 per share to our quarterly comparison. This segment benefited from the strong performance of its generation fleet and commercial organization as well as higher wholesale power prices. I will discuss this in more detail in the next slide. AEP river operations continue to rebound from the recent drought conditions adding $0.01 per share. Finally, corporate and other results were half a penny per share due to lower interest income at the parent. In summary, our earnings performance was strong, largely due to the affects of positive rate adjustments strong generation and commercial performance during periods of high prices and weather related improvements in retail sales. Turning to Slide 7, let\u2019s take look at AEP generation resources. This competitive generation business was a driver behind the positive quarterly results for the Generation and Marketing segment. The extreme temperatures and energy consumption during the quarter, significantly impacted energy pricing, for the quarter, AEP GEN HUB, Day-Ahead prices for around the clock power settled to 100% higher than they did year-ago. Henry Hub natural gas prices were 45% higher. In the phase of these extremes, our competitive generation team and the commercial organization we have built around it performed exceptionally well. Volumes for this fleet were up 22% and capacity factors were up 10%. The competitive generation fleet has about 2,500 megawatts of capacity that will retire by next summer. Approximately 1,800 megawatts of that capacity operated during the first quarter, those units experienced a capacity factor up 52%. On the right of the slide, you will see the percentage of sales by channel. The data shows that about 69% of generation resources sales had a hedge in the first quarter and about 31% were exposed to short-term or spot pricing. This allowed the commercial and generation teams to capture higher margins, as their output was needed to meet demand during high price periods. We view our competitive retail business has a positive margin hedge for our competitive generation, this business performed well during the first quarter. Now, turn to Slide 8, we will see our usual detail on normalized load. We are repeating the format we introduced last quarter that shows the industrial and total retail sales trends adjusted to reflect the loss of the Ormets load. On the bottom right quadrant, you can see that for the quarter weather normalized total load was up 1.5% compared to last year. Excluding Ormet, our normalized total retail sales were up 3.2%. On the bottom left of the slide, you can see that while a reported industrial sales growth was down 2.9% for the quarter, we continue to see steady improvement despite the loss of Ormet. Excluding Ormet from the comparison, our industrial sales were 2.2% higher for the quarter, in fact eight of our top ten industrial sectors showed positive growth compared to last year. The two sectors with declining industrial sales for the quarter were Primary Metals which was influenced by the shutdown of Ormet and mining expect for oil and gas with the shale gas revolution and increasing environmental regulations adversely impacted demand for coal. Residential sales shown in the upper left quadrant were up 4.4% for the quarter. We did see some improvement in our residential customer accounts, but most of the increase in residential sales was due to higher average usage. Finally, in the upper right quadrant, you can see the commercial sales increased 2.9% for the quarter. We saw customer growth in the commercial class of eight tenth of a percent and higher growth in average usage. Commercial sales growth was the strongest in the western footprint, where we also saw the strongest growth in employment. While we are happy to see increased volumes in our residential and commercial classes. We have concerns that our traditional weather normalization models do not fully capture the change in consumers\u2019 behavior during extreme weather events as was the case this winter. Now, I\u2019d like to take a few minutes to describe the most recent economic activity within AEP service territory. On Slide nine, you will see that we are introducing a few new charts to give you some perspective on how the economy within AEP service territory compares to what you may have read about within U.S. First looking at GDP for the quarter, you can see that estimated growth for AEP continues to outpace that of the U.S. at 3% and 2.7% respectively. The chart on the upper right shows that GDP in our western service area continues to outperform the U.S. and our eastern service territory. The bottom left chart displays employment growth within AEPs footprint compared to the U.S. For the quarter employment growth for AEP service area was up 1.4% compared to 1.7% for the U.S. Growth in employment trends tend to lead growth in retail sales and that has proven true for AEP this quarter. Finally, turning to the chart on the bottom right it is clear that the job market in our western footprint is consistently stronger than the U.S. than our eastern footprint. Even though U.S. employment growth moderated somewhat in Q1 compared to Q4 of last year, we saw continued improvement in employment growth in both the eastern and western parts of our service territory over the past two quarters. The last thing I want to discuss about load growth for the quarter is on Slide 10. As I had mentioned on previous calls, we are seeing quite a bit of growth related to shale gas activity. AEP is fortunate to have a number of major shale regions located within our service territory. The top chart illustrates the distinction that we are seeing in industrial sales growth between major shale regions as compared to non-shale regions. While we are seeing improving trends in both areas, the contrast in significant. For our shale counties excluding Ormet, industrial sales were up almost 30% in the first quarter, while industrial sales in non-shale counties were down four tenth of a percent. This is significant for AEP because 17% of our industrial sales are located in shale rich geographies. The bottom chart shows the industrial growth by major shale region. As you can see the most significant growth over the past two quarters has occurred in the Utica area in Ohio and the Permian Basin in Texas. We have already seen significant industrial sales growth around the Eagle Ford area in Texas, and the Marcellus Shale in West Virginia dating back to 2012. We are projecting additional new loads to be added in all five of the listed shale regions over the next several years. Turning to Slide 11, let\u2019s review the financial health of the company. Our total debt to total capitalization is now 54.2%. Our credit metrics, FFO interest coverage, and FFO to debt are solidly in the BBB and Baa1 range at 4.9 times and 19.9% respectively. Our qualified pension funding stands at 99% and our other post-employment benefit obligations are more than fully funded at a 122% our liquidity stands at about $3 million and it\u2019s supported by two revolving credit facilities with tenders that extend into the summers of 2016 and 2017. On January 31 Moody\u2019s upgraded AEP Inc\u2019s senior unsecured rating and the ratings of six of our operating companies. In its release announcing the upgrades Moody\u2019s cited it\u2019s more favorable view of the credit supportiveness of the U.S. regulatory environment. Moody\u2019s also noted AEP\u2019s diversity of utility subsidiaries cash flows the company successfully executed corporate restructuring and its growing rate base. We have worked hard over the last several years to achieve the credit metrics and balance sheet demonstrated and balance sheet strength demonstrated here and is because of the strength that we\u2019re confident in funding the incremental transmission investment for this year that Nick mentioned earlier. Finally, let me summarize the quarter and where we go from here the first quarter was very strong from an earnings standpoint operationally and by what we\u2019re able to accomplish for our customers in spite of extremely cold temperatures our generation team was able to keep our units running and our transmission and distribution employees were able to deliver energy to our customers to keep people warm and to keep businesses running. We insulated our retail customers from much higher wholesale electricity prices due to the transition plan in Ohio we were able to deliver our Ohio standard service offer to customers savings of a $132 million relatively to PJM Day-ahead market pricing for the quarter. In addition to our Ohio customers regulated customers of our integrated utility businesses benefited from the off-system sales margins to the tune of $74 million, an increase of $57 million over the last year\u2019s first quarter. At the EEI Conference in November and on the last earnings call we talked about how we\u2019d fill the revenue GAAP\u2019s in 2015 and 2016 as our transition in Ohio comes to an end. At that time we identified three efforts, one continuos improvement including lean initiatives, two cost shifting out of 2015 and 2016 and three, funding our transmission investments above base allocations. In regards to the continuos improvement efforts employees have now completed lean initiatives at six of our generating plants with plants to complete an additional seven during 2014. On the distribution side of our business we have a total of 32 work districts, two of these districts have completed lean initiatives, five were on process now with an additional six more to be completed this year. In places were employees have engaged in lean practices we have identified cost savings to more efficient work practices and better utilization of the contractor workforce our transmission supply chain, procurement and corporate center organizations are engaged in similar programs demonstrating the continuos improvement and employee engagement are part of our culture. In regards to cost shifting we have identified between $60 million and $70 million in work that we\u2019ll accelerate into 2014 from 2015 and 2016 the financial results of the first quarter give us confidence at accelerating this work will benefit our customers this year and our shareholders in future years. In our Transmission Holdco segment we had identified a base level of capital investment that was part of our budget forecast as well as a high case for incremental capital investment, the strong first quarter results give us confidence that we can fund an incremental $140 million in Transmission Holdco business and an additional $60 million in operating company transmission spend, we intend to fund this investment from operating cash flows and retain earnings and do not plan to issue incremental debt to do so. This accelerated investment means that our transmission customers, will realize enhanced reliability sooner and our shareholders will realize higher returns. Finally, in addition to the activities mentioned about as Nick mentioned earlier, we are able to raise our earnings guidance for 2014 to a range of $3.35 per share to $3.55 per share. At this time, we are reaffirming our guidance for 2015 and 2016. As is our custom, we will likely present detailed guidance for future years, at the fall EEI Conference. With that said, the strong first quarter of this year has enabled us to execute against our plans with confidence and to deliver on our commitments to our customers and shareholders. I will now turn the call over to the operator, for your questions. Operator :  Thank you (Operator Instructions). First question from the line of Dan Eggers, Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Dan L. Eggers \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC : Hi, good morning guys. Unidentified Company Representative : Good morning, Dan. Dan L. Eggers \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC : A couple of your neighbors in Ohio have made announcements that they\u2019re looking next to their generation assets to a sales process. Can you just give an update on what your thought process is for your fleet and what bearing the first quarter may or may not have had on making that decision? Nicholas K. Akins:  Yes, I think our process is unchanged, we\u2019ve said earlier that, we are going to be focusing on producing value out of that piece of the business to position that business the best we can. To try to take some of the volatility out of business and certainly to do what we can from a cost stand point within that business. And Chuck and in his team are definitely working on all of those activity. So I\u2019d \u2013 the first quarter doesn\u2019t change our opinion of our look at that business one way or another. And I think that, as we go through the process we still have yet to see those per cursors that we talked about earlier, what happens to the capacity markets? Certainly what happens to the energy markets? What we can do with the cost structure of that business? And then how do we take the volatility of the business with not only the capacity markets, but the hedging activities that are occurring in the background relative to regulated generation. So we\u2019re still, that we\u2019re still on the same time schedule having the same discussions with our board as we go through this process and we will continue that and make decisions later on in this year and the next year. Dan L. Eggers \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC : And I guess Nick one of the ideas if you find people who would sign longer-term contracts and be interested in staying in those assets. With the first quarter volatility kind of timing market conditions, Are you having a change in tone in those conversations at this juncture? Nicholas K. Akins:  Yes, sort of interesting there is discussion about long-term purchase power arrangements that could occur relative to this generation I think the polar vortex the sense that there is \u2013 certainly there is no when you look at the long-term markets is illiquid there is not much out there going on and sort of tends to keep those process low in the future, but we know that is the closure we get to this generation retiring, that\u2019s likely to change. And I firmly believe there is renewed interest and what that generation looks like and how it can preserve from a long-term PPA perspective customers expectations around taking out that volatility and having some consistency. So, yes we are getting some interest in that, yet to determine what that means but it we see sustained energy process that are a bit higher than anticipated in the capacity markets we were I\u2019m sure the degree of interest will intensify as well. So again our position is not changed relative to that, we can make it look cause our regulated then it\u2019s a business that\u2019s worth taking a look at. Dan L. Eggers \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC :  Great, thanks. And just one last question, can you give us an update on where coal inventories are at this point in time and under the strategy around the country you have full availability for this one. Nicholas K. Akins: Yes, so we\u2019re fine on coal deliveries, we\u2019re at about 25 days on average on the system, we were 35 days going into the winner. So and keep in mind our suppliers are taken to the Mississippi and then \u2013 and then we have the Barge business to bring that coal to the plant. So we are in good shape there and most of our delivers are over the Union Pacific Railroad and their performance has been recently well rolled down as well. I think as we move into summer, that\u2019s when inventory levels start to improve, but anticipation of warmer weather over the summer, but we are in great shape. Brian X. Tierney: Dan, we\u2019ve heard of some people doing things like burning more gas to build up their coal inventories, we went into the winter fairly healthy and we haven\u2019t had to change or dispatch our commitment at all in response to our coal levels. Dan L. Eggers \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC :  Great. Thank you guys. Nicholas K. Akins: Sure. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Brian Chin, Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Nicholas K. Akins: Good morning, Brian. Brian Chin \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch International Ltd.: Hi, good morning. On the $60 million to $70 million in cost shifting, is it fair to think about that, is that a cumulative amount of cost shifting from 2015 and 2016 into 2014? Brian X. Tierney: What do you mean by cumulative? Brian Chin \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch International Ltd.: So, $60 million to $70 million in bringing forecast from 2015 and 2016 together, so in other words the expense levels in 2015 and 2016 prior to this announcement we should bought about is being $60 million to $70 million higher over the two years? Brian X. Tierney: Yes, it was forecasted to be spent for us in 2015 and 2016 and we\u2019ve now taken those costs and activities out of 2015 and 2016 and are now reflecting in 2014. Brian Chin \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch International Ltd.: And is that more of our front-end loaded as in more 2015 level of cost shifting or it\u2019s more backend loaded as in more 2016 and then also could you give a little bit more of a business segment breakdown of that cost shifting? Brian X. Tierney: Yes, so it\u2019s evenly spread across both years and it\u2019s across all of our business segments, so this significant component of it coming from generation and moving outages out of those years into 2014. Brian Chin \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch International Ltd.: Excellent. Thank you very much. Nicholas K. Akins: Thank you, Brian. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Stephen Byrd, Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Stephen C. Byrd \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good morning. Nicholas K. Akins: Hi, Stephen. How you doing? Stephen C. Byrd \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great, thank you. I wanted to talk more about your high case growth plans and transmission, you are showing real good progress this year, could you maybe talk at a high level as to \u2013 as you think about what needs to happened to be able to achieve that growth over the next couple of years in terms of whether that be approvals or planning efforts resource, whatever it might be just how we should sort of think about the risk of execution, or what approvals, what milestones you need to hit to be able to achieve that growth. Nicholas K. Akins: Yes, so we\u2019ve been very clear for probably two or three years now that and I don\u2019t know if you can recall the slide that had the base transmission and then had a green piece above that was incremental transmission that were real projects that were ready to be done, but we had to fund the capital to do it and what you see in this quarter is refocus of $200 million on that incremental green portion. So as far as risk there is very little risk associated with those projects that are already identified, rate to be done, and you can expect those returns relative to those investments to occur. So and as we look forward to the business I think we\u2019ve been a proponent order 1000 and very focused on our joint ventures as well in our Transource entity, ETT and others and they move forward pretty well as well. So we continue to look for ways to continue to improve the transmission earnings profile and that\u2019s a very distinct focus for us. But the only things we\u2019re reporting are real projects and we sort of learned our lesson awhile back about the supposition of what may happen we\u2019ve gotten over that. Brian X. Tierney: Steven the beauty of the chart that shows the incremental transmission spend that we can make going from the base case to the high case, is that we can fund that serially as capital becomes available. So whether it\u2019s cash flows from operations, the bonus depreciation should get approved later this year. We can serially fund that incremental growth capital on a year-by-year basis and as we talked about earlier, cash flows from operations enabled us to do it this year and we\u2019ll just see how this \u2013 the end of this year and future year\u2019s play out. But since we have that growth opportunity existing within our own business, that\u2019s an awful smart place for us to put incremental capital to work. Stephen C. Byrd \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC:  That\u2019s great color, thank you. And just follow up on transmission, when you look at the competitive side of the business I\u2019m just curious if you could talk at a high level attitude the competitive dynamics there, how competitive is that, how do you access your capabilities versus others. How does that business playing out? Nicholas K. Akins: I think we\u2019re absolutely well positioned from a competitive standpoint. Obviously that\u2019s why we\u2019ve proponent of it. But when we look at the projects that we do, the project flow, the project management structure, the engineering expertise that we have and the fact that we\u2019ve got joint ventures around portions of the country and just with the scope of our transmission system drives the benefits for our investors relative to transmission. We\u2019re well positioned in terms of the breadth and if you are plowing $1.7 billion a year in transmission projects which that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing over the next three year period each year. That\u2019s a pretty substantial critical mass around the growth of transmission. So we\u2019re not gold plating anything, we\u2019re not trying to fund projects just to do projects, these are all immediate projects in terms of refurbishment and reoptimization of the grid with retirements and generation and so forth. So a very clear path for the business case relative to transmission as far as AEP is concerned. Stephen C. Byrd \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: That\u2019s great color. Thank you very much. Nicholas K. Akins: Yes. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith, UBS. Please go ahead. Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS Securities LLC :  Hi, good morning. Nicholas K. Akins: Good morning, Julien. Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS Securities LLC : So quick follow-up there on the generation business. I\u2019d be curious, is there any tolerability in Ohio as you are thinking about it, perhaps to see some of those longer term contract against the remainder of the generation business in particular? Nicholas K. Akins: Yes, sort of an interesting thing, Ohio certainly needs to take notice in my opinion of what happened during the polar vortex, and I would have to say that there is discussions going on relative to how Ohio would do with that in the future. Because it\u2019s a clear indication that we really do need to think about the portfolio for Ohio customers that has a long-term component and a short-term component to it and customers are continued to allow the switch. But keep in mind I mean we separated our generation and it is separated. So if we would do purchase power arrangements and that kind of thing. It would have to be something to provide value to consumers on the long-term, but also value to the company as far as hedging that generation for the long-term. And I think there is a distinct opportunity for those types of discussions. It\u2019s positive for us, it\u2019s a positive for Ohio and it\u2019s certainly positive for consumers in the long run particularly industrial customers, who are looking at the polar vortex and where energy markets win, there is high degree of concern about that. So, more work to be done there. Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS Securities LLC :  Interesting, is it about savings some of the more marginal goal assets, kind of in a more normalized environment, or is this about just again security and supply? I suppose you could kind of cut it both ways? Brian X. Tierney:  I think it\u2019s cut both ways, when you look at jobs, taxes certainly generation within Ohio and the fact that Ohio really depended upon the capacity markets to provide long-term pricing as we knew that\u2019s not going to happen or at least not has happened thus far. So there is a degree of interest area that needs to occur relative to taking matters in their own hands from an Ohio perspective. Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS Securities LLC :  Interesting, and I will be curious following upon all the Utica discussion, are you seeing any nascent development on the gas project front I mean I will be curious just in terms of new gas plant entry and also broadly where gas basis is headed in your neck of the woods up there? Brian X. Tierney: Well, I think it\u2019s a challenge in Ohio, because certainly from a Utica standpoint, there is a great opportunity to use a resource that\u2019s indigenous within Ohio. But at the same time you got to have the fundamentals in the market and an improving economy to drive that investment and right now you have at least some glamour of hope on the economic recovery, but at the same time the market signals just aren\u2019t there. So we need to get that solidified before you see natural gas-type development. Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS Securities LLC : Great, thank you. Operator :  Thank you. Next question is from the line of Greg Gordon, ISI Group. Please go ahead. Nicholas K. Akins: Good morning, Greg. Greg Gordon \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group LLC :  Thanks, good morning guys. So, I understand you\u2019re taking the opportunity to accelerate some expenses into the year given to the phenomenal opportunities in the first quarter and the earnings result. But then also looking at the earnings guidance range, what are you assuming as a baseline that your annual sales forecast comes in as originally articulated or you assuming that you see the trend line as you saw in the first quarter? Brian X. Tierney: Yes, we have unchanged the load forecast at this point in the guidance, even in the adjusted guidance range that we\u2019ve now given, so because we are very clear that one quarter does not make a trend and certainly form a polar vertex perspective there is a continued cold weather, could that have skewed the weather normalization routines that we usually go through to adjust these numbers. And whenever we get extreme heat or extreme cold for a long period of time, you have to question that. So we\u2019re going \u2013 have to see some during this coming quarter and the third quarter a consistency around that before we make those kinds of adjustments and we\u2019re being deliberately conservative there. Brian X. Tierney: Greg we are forecasting, we have factored in the forecast the higher wholesale prices for the balance of the year. Nicholas K. Akins: Yes. As far as energy prices, that\u2019s changed. Greg Gordon \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group LLC : Okay, so you factored in higher sort of APC wholesale prices, but you haven\u2019t assumed anymore volatility of the nature that we saw? Nicholas K. Akins: No. Greg Gordon \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group LLC :  And then you are saying that when I look at page 8, that 4.4% 1Q 2014 residential, weather normal number, you are saying you are nerves that it might not be in accurate number in your 41 to see how things trends in the second and third quarter? Nicholas K. Akins: Yes, just saying we don\u2019t no to the degree at this point to really make that adjustment and, but I think it\u2019s pretty clear though that directionally it\u2019s in the right direction. It is increasing, the question is the order of magnitude and before we make that adjustment we want to be very secured in what we are seeing. Brian X. Tierney: Greg, for the first time and some time we saw on both the residential and commercial classes significantly higher average normalized usage and more concern that the normalization models don\u2019t behave as well at describing the weather effects versus the normal effects in extreme weather, and so we\u2019d like to see another quarter before we start thinking about changing the balance of the year load forecast. Greg Gordon \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group LLC :  Great, thanks. Obviously, great start. Congratulations. Brian X. Tierney: Thank you, Greg. Operator : Next question is from the line of Paul Patterson, Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead. Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates LLC : Good morning. Brian X. Tierney: Good morning. Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates LLC : The sales growth forecast, the 10-year forecast that you guys recently put out, maybe just kind of sort of lower growth over 10 years. I guess negative growth are just flattish or what how you. And I was wondering if you sort of comment on that and whether or not you think that might change with the legislation that\u2019s being purposed and just sort of how we should think about that I guess this is all Ohio, I\u2019m sorry. If you could just sort of discuss sort of a little bit about that and what you are thinking is going on there? Nicholas K. Akins: Yes, so sort of a frame of reference that was used in that, if you looked at sort of comparing Apples and Oranges because one includes Ormet obviously the future anticipated it is nice. So if you exclude Ormet the energy is increasing. Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay, but the load forecast it sounds when I look at it seems like it\u2019s declining or just slightly flat really over the years, it doesn\u2019t look like there is really much change let say from 2016 to 2024? Nicholas K. Akins: Yes, that\u2019s true, we\u2019ve been anticipating for period now that load forecasting will be relatively flat and we haven\u2019t changed that because we haven\u2019t seen the longevity of the fundamentals. I mean we\u2019re seeing initial indication in the fourth quarter of last year, I think we\u2019ve seen a broader indication this first quarter, but I think it will more capital we are going to see in another quarter to and make that determination. Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay, does any of this have to do with the legislation that\u2019s being, that\u2019s currently in place or might change in Ohio or could that have an impact that we should think about and if so can you give us a feeling for that? Brian X. Tierney: No, overall the energy efficiency was pretty negligible to begin with in the overall scheme of things but as far as the legislation is concerned it\u2019s not I mean its not a significant impact at all. Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates LLC :  Okay, and then just following up on Julien\u2019s question, contracting, it sounded to me that there might be some industrial interest in this. But also I wasn\u2019t clear whether or not there is any governmental interest in this. There was some comments on the part of the governor in Ohio excuse me about so second thoughts perhaps on deregulation and whether it was the best move. I was wondering if you just elaborate a little bit if there is, if there is a thought like hey you mentioned field diversity what have you but perhaps the thought that something new should change from a state policy perspective to sort of ensure that there\u2019s still diversity and all the things that nuclear and coal provide. Brian X. Tierney:  Yes, and certainly the Governor can speak for himself. But there is certainly is recognition but its apparent by the governor and as well others including industrials that we really have to think about how to address this lack of market consistency particularly as it relates to the PJM capacity market. But we do have legislation in place, we do have competition that\u2019s there our generation is separated. So you really have to think about that in the context of how you make these adjustments. And keep in mind we in December AEP filed its ESP case with a PPA arrangement from a portion of our units that was in a partnership or OVEK units that allowed for recovery through a purchase power arrangement. And you could see some expansion of that PPA to accommodate other generation resources within the state and that would be a way to address at least some portion of the overall requirement of Ohio customers that could be served with a long-term for formal based rate contract that could supply some of those needs. And that\u2019s something that could be done. And I think as people become more aware of where we stand relative to retirements of coal-fired generation where we stand in terms of if we do have an economic recovery that\u2019s occurring at the same time Ohio has to really think about not only the investment potential for new generation but also the maintenance of existing generation and that\u2019s what the key component of these discussion within tale. Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates LLC :  Do you think there will be any need for change in regulatory or legislation or I mean with that entail any of that or is there something that could be done under current constructors that you see. Brian X. Tierney:  No, we see it as something that could be done under the current constructors evidenced by our PPA arrangement that we filed in our ESP filing late last year we believe that would be done and customers could continue to choose although and all likely have the long-term PPA\u2019s would be non-bypassable charge or something like that they would benefit Ohio in total, but and at the same time allow customers to continue to shop and choose suppliers. Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. Thanks a lot, really appreciated. Operator : Next question is from the line of Jonathan Arnold, Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Nicholas K. Akins: Hi, Jonathan. Jonathan P. Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good morning guys. And just quick question on the I think in the annual guidance you had laid out I think $175 million for rate relief is the target I just conform, is that 65 that you had in the first quarter is that one on an apples-to-apple basis, sort of 65 to 175 of the bag. Is that the right way to think about it? Brian X. Tierney:  Well, it\u2019s on an annualize basis the 175, so it\u2019s for the full year of 2014. So, we\u2019re of the 175 that we\u2019ve previously identified we are right on track to get all of that. Jonathan P. Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: So, that I know you are on track to get exceeded that? Brian X. Tierney: No. Jonathan P. Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: That\u2019s still the number. Okay. Brian X. Tierney: Yes, we are right on it. Jonathan P. Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks, Brian. And one other thing, I was just curious that you look at the portfolio, and how it performed in the first quarter. You obviously had some of the sales commitments and then the access to sell spot. If you kind of imagine a world where you hadn\u2019t had the plants that you are going to be shutting, would you still have been that long and would you been kind of more in places showed and how is the portfolio kind of evolving to address that? Brian X. Tierney:  Well, it\u2019s two things. One is that there clearly would have been less volume, right there was a 52% capacity factor on the 1800 megawatts, but for the whole country sake and there would be less volume and likely higher prices. So we don\u2019t know what the net effect of that would be \u2013 would we\u2019ve had more hours that $1800 megawatt hour. Nicholas K. Akins: And keep in mind that from the generation perspective we no longer have the obligation to serve in Ohio. So it really is about an optimization business is oppose to ever increasing demand and having to serve them. So that really drives the whole different business model relative to that and then from the overall market context as Brian said certainly there is implications and shortage of capacity and I think people are realizing that. Brian X. Tierney: To answer your question directly Jonathan as well we would still be net long. Jonathan P. Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yes, I\u2019m thinking the 1800 megawatts to 52% CapEx, it probably wouldn\u2019t have been the whole of that 31%? Nicholas K. Akins: That\u2019s correct. Jonathan P. Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Okay, thank you very much. Brian X. Tierney: Yes. Operator : The next question is from the line of Paul Ridzon, KeyBanc. Please go head. Paul T. Ridzon \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Good morning. Can you hear me? Brian X. Tierney: Yes, Paul. We can hear you. Paul T. Ridzon \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Just wanted to clarify that this $200 million transmission is not an acceleration, it\u2019s actually incremental that you found because you have this capital head room? Nicholas K. Akins: That\u2019s right, it\u2019s incremental. Paul T. Ridzon \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: And I didn\u2019t see any discussion of Ohio shopping. Is that a big impact or have we kind of lapped out at this point? Nicholas K. Akins: Yes, we\u2019re in the upper 60% right now in terms of switching; we anticipate that by the end of the year we\u2019d be about 71% switched. Paul T. Ridzon \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay, and then any comments about your expectations about the upcoming auction? Nicholas K. Akins: Are we talking about the PJM capacity auction or\u2026 Paul T. Ridzon \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Yes, yes sorry, sorry PJM. Nicholas K. Akins: Yes, our expectation is that the capacity prices will go probably in that $80 to $100 per megawatt day range, but who knows I mean because the way this capacity construct works, where things happen all the time. And as long as we get some of these adjustments from a FERC perspective that certainly will be helpful. But again it\u2019s one of those things that, and it goes back to the earlier discussion of how we view this business. If you can\u2019t really that market construct and PJM it\u2019s very difficult to really map out what the revenues are going to be from a capacity standpoint. So hopefully, it will be certainly something that is more adequate, certainly for the continued operations of base load generation like coal and nuclear. Paul T. Ridzon \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.:  Thank you. Operator : Next question is from the line of Steven Fleishman, Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Nicholas K. Akins: Good morning, Steve. Steve I. Fleishman \u2013 Wolfe Research LLC :  Hi, first clarification to 25 day coal piles you have now. What would that be versus like a normal or year-ago? Nicholas K. Akins:  Last year I think we were still at the 30, 35 day range, I think it was 35 we move from 45 to 35, but it\u2019s not unusual we\u2019ve had inventory levels in the past as low as 10 day. So it\u2019s not anything that, that we have to do any corrective action around. Steve I. Fleishman \u2013 Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. Second question is on I think you mentioned at these PJM uplift charges was a bit of a drag in the quarter? Did you \u2013 were you able to pass those through it all or you have to kind of absorb those? Nicholas K. Akins: So the once that identified that made up, most of that $0.05 per share difference for the vertically integrated we\u2019re in the jurisdictions where we couldn\u2019t pass them through. In some of our jurisdictions we are allowed to pass them through on trackers. Brian X. Tierney: You can pass them through on trackers you have the opportunity to recover them Nicholas K. Akins: In future periods. Brian X. Tierney: In future periods. Steve I. Fleishman \u2013 Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. And did you defer then the cost of those, or you could do that. Brian X. Tierney:  We were not able to defer those. Steve I. Fleishman \u2013 Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. And you are going to see coal recovery like first energy as in some of these on your retail contracts can you do that? Nicholas K. Akins:  Yes, so these are different items that we are talking about, one was for the vertically integrated utilities. And then there is the issue of passing through to customers on our competitive retail side. We\u2019ve made a corporate decision that we\u2019re not going to pass those through associated with the first quarter of this year. We have a misstep in some customers started to see those charges pass through, we have gone back and since corrected that and for this quarter we are not passing those incremental charges through to our competitive retail customers. Steve I. Fleishman \u2013 Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. One last question, we are going to get the EPA green house gas rule soon for existing and just made curious what you\u2019re expecting there and how you are thinking about potential implications? Brian X. Tierney: Yes, if you hear what\u2019s being said, certainly Gena McCarthy has been public about certainly they don\u2019t have any \u2013 at least they are not focused on anything relative to reducing the reliability of the grid. I think that\u2019s clearly within question now and she has reinforced the point that they are not trying to take coal away that there are not \u2013 they are concerned about the reliability of the grid and won\u2019t do anything to unpair that. So there is somewhat of an expectation that they may go outside the fence and focus on energy efficiency on those types of things with the state, and give the states which I said they would give the state a lot of opportunity to be able to come up with their mechanisms to adjust to the new targets. So it\u2019s going to be I mean in my opinion it\u2019s going to wind up being a state process that we go through, and one that at least dispose to provide a significant amount of flexibility and how we respond and certainly with Hazmat went further then anyone anticipated in terms of retirement generation, and in fact AEP is already 21% lower than 2005 levels and the present targets worth 17% by 2020. So the industry is already come along way and the particular AEP has, so I think as long as they give that geographic and state flexibility we should have an opportunity to respond in very incredible fashion. Unidentified Analyst :  Thank you. Nicholas K. Akins:  Operator, we have time for one more question. Operator :  Okay. Next question is from the line of Michael Lapides, Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Michael J. Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.:  Hey, guys congrats on a great quarter and thank you for taking my call. Nicholas K. Akins: Thanks, Michael. Michael J. Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.: I just want to look at Slide 4 where you show the earned ROEs by jurisdiction. And I want to compare it to the same slide from the first quarter of 2013\u2019s earnings call. Because if I do that, except for Ohio Power in Texas, pretty much everything else is down year-over-year rolling 12 months. How much of those decreases do you attribute to weather versus other factors? Nicholas K. Akins:  Yes, I don\u2019t see much of it in terms of weather. I think the ones that are down have investments that are occurring like there is \u2013 there is a transfers that occurred to APCo and to Kentucky that takes a while to stabilize after you make these certain I mean settlement deals that are done and then you come in for rate cases for recovery for Mitchell and Kentucky and so forth. And then of course Turk being just built in SWEPCO, so and then the transmission the heavy investment cycle it\u2019s going on there. So I think it\u2019s really more reflection of the timing of the investments cycle and similarly we worked long and hard on putting writers in place to bring the revenue more concurrent, but on these large capital investments we continue to work due to rate process. And Indiana has been very positive because certainly the I&M team has been very successful in putting legislation in place that essentially allows that recovery more quickly for things like the nuclear Life Cycle Management. So I would not read that as we have a continued deterioration of ROEs. I would it as more where we are at in the investment cycle. Michael J. Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Okay. And just when you think about 2014 and 2015, what efforts, so kind of specific, whether it\u2019s specific jurisdiction or specific state, do you anticipate trying to get done that makes a structural change to reduce lag? Nicholas K. Akins: Certainly, Kentucky. I mean getting the Mitchell assets reflected in Kentucky\u2019s base rate is a big component of that. And that\u2019s what a lot of the drag on Kentucky\u2019s ROE is it \u2013 it\u2019s equity component is increased so much and to transfer those Mitchell assets over there. Brian X. Tierney: And APCo and West Virginia, and certainly that ROE has been low for a long period of time and its while Virginia has stabilized in a very good place, West Virginia we still need to work that\u2019s why we are making the filing this year. So those initiatives will be in place to do and then as far as SWEPCO is concerned. We continue to look for home relative to the investment the 88 megawatts of Turk station and Arkansas should be looking at that at some point hopefully, because they see the value of those assets. And then overall load growth and some reductions and some of the capacity that PPA contracts that flow to SWEPCO have ended. So there is an opportunity for the use of that additional capacity and energy with in the SWEPCO portfolio. So and there is issues in regard to that as well. So you could bet that any of these that appear low at this point there is a whole litany of actions being taken in the background to bring those backup to acceptable levels. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. Okay, thanks guys much appreciated. Bette Jo Rozsa : Thank you for joining us on today's call. And as always, the IR team will be available to answer any additional questions you may have. Kevin, can you give replay information please? Operator : Thank you.

Today, we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors. Joining me this morning for opening remarks are Nick Akins, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Tierney, our Chief Financial Officer. We will take your questions following their remarks. I will now turn the call over to Nick. Nick Akins : Okay. Thanks, Julie. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us today at our second quarter 2014 earnings call. I am once again pleased to report a very positive quarter for AEP driven by strong regulated company results with a continued emphasis on the transmission business as well as our regulated utilities. Additionally, our unregulated generation, retail and river operations divisions performed well for the quarter. So, the headlines for the quarter very positive. AEP delivered GAAP and operating earnings of $0.80 per share compared with $0.69 per share GAAP and $0.73 per share operating earnings for the second quarter \u201913. Year-to-date 2014 GAAP and operating earnings have now resulted in $1.95 per share compared with $1.44 GAAP and $1.53 operating for the same period in 2013. We are reaffirming our earlier adjusted guidance range for the year of $3.35 to $3.55 per share and remain committed to our 4% to 6% growth trajectory based on our original 2013 guidance range. AEP is allocating another $100 million of incremental capital in 2014 to our transmission business. As you may recall, we previously allocated $200 million of incremental capital of transmission in the first quarter so we are executing on our plan of advancing the transmission business model. Additionally ETT has been rated BAA1 by Moody\u2019s and is now paying a dividend to its owners so good news from the Western front. Growth in our service territory continues for the quarter with weather normalized load increasing 2.3% overall for the year so far excluding the effects of Ormet, the industrial load that went bankrupt last year. In fact, once again excluding Ormet during the second quarter, the industrial load was up a healthy 4.5% and 3.4% year-to-date drilling by the shale gas, petrochemicals and all industrial sectors with the exception of mining. Commercial and residential loads continue to be up for the year as well. Brian will cover the load growth in more detail later but we\u2019re pleased with the energy transition that is occurring in our territory and what that means for load growth for the future. Cost containment activities resulting from culture and LEAN processes continue on target and we remain committed to reinforcing these activities throughout our companies. We\u2019ll have more to talk about on that issue later on. So, the fundamentals of operational excellence, capital and OEM discipline and open and collaborative culture that defines our ability to meet, challenges. And finally the focus on execution of our business plan in support of infrastructure development and the customer experience is intact at AEP and once again exemplified by second quarter performance. But we still have much work to do as we redefine in AEP that delivers consistent quality earnings and dividend growth while meeting the challenges of the future. So, let me add a little context to some of the areas that you might find adventurous. On the regulatory front, APCo, in West Virginia, filed a base rate case on June 30, requesting a rate increase of $226 million of which $45 million is a vegetation rider. Our earned ROE in the West Virginia jurisdiction of APCo was 5.8% as filed with our current approved range of 10% to 10.9%, so an increase here is definitely warranted. We don\u2019t have a finalized procedure schedule for the case but we expected to conclude by April of next year. Also PSO filed a non-unanimous settlement with AARP as the only outlier. It essentially keeps present rates in place with an addition of AMI rider that increases revenues by over $7 million in 2014 increasing to over $27 million in 2016. So we are pleased with the parties to continue to recognize the value of infrastructure development to improve the customer experience. Before discussing our initial thoughts on the EPA\u2019s Clean Power Plan, let me switch you over to the next page of the presentation material to my favorite equalizer chart. Overall, from last quarter, the regulated operations ROE has moved up to 10.1% from 9.9% last quarter. So, let\u2019s start moving across the page. Starting out with 8, Ohio Power, their ROI is about 14% now but we expect by year end their ROE should come down to around the 12% range. For APCo, the combined companies certainly masked the disparity between Virginia and West Virginia ROEs. Virginia is in pretty good shape. Its ROE is around 10.8% which is within the earnings band of 10.4% to 11.4%. As you know we\u2019re working on West Virginia with the rate case so that will be filed and certainly we expect to make progress there. From a conductive power standpoint, Kentucky is still as we mentioned in previous quarters, there already is low due to the transfer of the Mitchell Plant. So, while their earnings are up, the equity balance is significantly up. So, it draws the ROE down. We\u2019ll follow rate case at the end of 2014 that would reflect the full recovery of Mitchell and expect this case to be effective in July 2015. In the meantime, there could be increases in ROE given there is a mechanism that also some sales would inure to the benefit of Kentucky Power if you reached certain threshold. So, that should come up a little bit. I&M, with rate cases completed in early 2013 and strong plant performance adding to offset some sales. I&M is currently earning in ROE slightly higher than authorized at 10.8%. Their authorized ROE is 10.2% so not too far out of line there. And they certainly have made a lot of progress in that regard. It\u2019s noteworthy that they filed for the additional five solar facilities totaling 16 megawatts as well. So really lot of positive things occurring over in the I&M jurisdictions. PSO, as I mentioned earlier with the rate case, the reduced ROE is really actually occurring from the O&M that\u2019s been moved for generation expenses during the quarter. So, that advancement of O&M is $60 million, some of them went to PSO and that\u2019s what\u2019s pulling their ROE down somewhat, so we expect that to improve as well. For SWEPCo, it continues to be a lower ROE given that we still have yet to get the disposition of the Arkansas portion of the third plant taken care of. There is work in progress to try to address that situation. In the meantime, there will be several initiatives they\u2019re underway and including a Texas filing to recover transmission cost and then LEAN programs to lower cost and generation distribution. But as we go forward we\u2019ll be certainly looking after the election in Arkansas to really push forward with the activities around the Arkansas portion of Turk. AEP Texas has favorable ROEs, primarily because of the impact of securitization but they\u2019re also doing well from a distribution perspective as well. AEP Transco continues to improve. You\u2019ll probably see a pretty sizeable jump there from 9.7% last quarter up to 11.4%. As we told you last quarter, their ROE would increase particularly in line with the true-ups adjustments that occurred that were just now booked as a result of \u201913 adjustment so, very good progress in the transmission area. So that pretty well wraps it up for the equalizer chart and certainly we\u2019re making a lot of progress in that regard. We know what the areas are that we\u2019re working on. So you can expect continued improvement in that area. As I said earlier, our LEAN activities are progressing very well. We\u2019re not letting up on the progress here because this part of our cultural transformation redefining how we do business in the future. So, Brian will be reviewing the details around the LEAN activities in moment. But I did want to point out some of the examples of what we were seeing from areas such as generation and distribution. At Cardinal Plant, they bought a truck to load all the welding materials in one place what that was mobile so that they wouldn\u2019t have to go back and forth to get inventory for parts. And that significantly saves time in terms of addressing tube leaks and other areas to get generation back more quickly. The South Ben storage yard, de-cluttering an organization of storerooms and toolkits of it, work times can be improved. The engineering group created new documents to enable faster response at times for projects to our customers so that certainly improve the customer experience. Cook Nuclear is going through LEAN activities and one of the first in the country to go through that type of activity. And we\u2019re significantly already have a reduced targeted refueling outage duration and the costs associated with it. So, there is a multitude of process reviews to eliminate redundant activities and those that don\u2019t add value. So, obviously we\u2019re very careful with that \u2013 with the nuclear side. But certainly it\u2019s something that we should do so that we can work smarter at the Cook Nuclear station. And just to give you an idea of the range of the things that our employees are coming up with, at Amos Plant, they reviewed the plant\u2019s barge unloading system that led to $6 million investment to be made but it reduces coal costs by $10 million per year, very positive. And then smaller change, but I think no less important is in APCo Charleston area, an employee notice that we were discarding flagging vests. And we started to decide to wash them instead and save $6,000 per year. And I know that sounds small but that\u2019s one employee coming up for the $6,000 per year and with our 20,000 employees, that\u2019s $120 million. So, if those kinds of things that we\u2019ll have to work indigenously within our organization at levels throughout the organization to ensure that we continue to get the benefits of the LEAN activities and the efficiency changes that we\u2019re making. So I\u2019m very proud of what our employees at the front line are accomplishing in their LEAN activities. Lastly, I want to AEP\u2019s thoughts on the EPA Clean Power Plant. From the outset, I want to reiterate AEP\u2019s commitment towards achieving a balanced portfolio of resources that provides clean, affordable and reliable power for our customers. While much progress has already been made towards reductions in all emission categories, including carbon dioxide and while further progress is certainly being made, rational timing and targets are absolutely critical in achieving the substantial reductions in CO2 emissions contemplated by the EPA plant. As Administrator McCarthy has mentioned on several occasions and I want to reiterate here, is that this far reaching plant is a proposed rule and is yet to be finalized. So, as we look at the proposed rule, the current plan is much too aggressive in many states. And in fact, it\u2019s a multi-variable equation that doesn\u2019t solve within the timeframe given. To force a change in resource mix, system dispatch and market conditions, along with navigating a myriad of state related review process is covering many issues, while not impacting reliability in such a short timeframe could result basically in a convoluted mess that turns the foundation, assumption, and building blocks of the plan in the pipe drains. The idea of natural gas generation to run at 70% capacity factor, we needed the plant\u2019s natural gas pipeline system or the electric system is in place to support, it is not credible. Or to expect 6% efficiency gains on coal units to occur, when only about 1% is viable even if capacity factors remained high, which will \u2013 which won\u2019t happen because we have a forced dispatch of weather resources ahead of low-cost coal and that\u2019s just not credible either. Moreover to expect energy efficiency overall to improve 1.5% per year, when EPRI itself, the Electric Power Research Institute, has determined it only 0.5% to 0.6% can be achieved annually, certainly goes beyond aspirational thinking. As the CEO, I\u2019m all about aspirational visions but this must be grounded reality. These are state plans, not AEP plans or other market participant plans, so we must be able to have time to work with the multitude of different stakeholders including the state, and the EPA to determine a course and be able to execute on the myriad of different processes and approvals to make this transformation occur. AEP is committed to working with the EPA just as we did during the Mercury Rule comment period which is far from over by the way given 2015 pending retirements of coal fire generation have yet to occur. AEP was right about the analysis of the Mercury Rules and we will continue to be factual and collaborative during the upcoming comment process. As an aside, speaking of the units retiring in 2015, 80% of them were called upon and ran during the second quarter, a quarter that was essentially no extreme weather conditions. And certainly there were outages being taken, generation has to take maintenances outages during that part of the year. But it\u2019s incredible that 80% recalled upon just a year in advance of their retirement. Briefly in regards to the unregulated generation, if I can talk a little bit about that, we continue to review with the board the options available to us regarding the future of that business. And we continue to reinforce the value of the unregulated generation through market reforms, hedging of our generation through our retail and wholesale businesses and advanced regulatory initiatives such as development of purchase power arrangements. This PPA initiative not only supports Ohio generation but provides a value hedge to customers against volatile market conditions. Any decisions with regard to the unregulated generation business will be made on a timely basis to maximize shareholder value. Speaking of shareholder value, every capital decision we make is based upon our ability to move capital to infrastructure developments particularly transmission and the regulated operations. For those of you thinking about M&A, the way we look at it, because we have about $2 billion of incremental transmission projects over the next four years looking for capital, we made \u201c$200 million acquisition\u201d in the first quarter, $100 acquisition this quarter at a good return with virtually no delay, no premium and accretive to shareholders. That\u2019s our standard for investment. So, in a nutshell, we have had another great quarter centered on the fundamentals we laid out for our investors over two years ago, you can expect us to stick with their plans to be a regulated utility to drive effective capital and OEM discipline, and continually adjust to the challenges ahead. Thanks. And I\u2019ll now turn it over to Brian. Brian? Brian Tierney : Thank you, Nick. And good morning everyone. On slide 5, you will see our comparison of 2014 results to 2013 by segment for both the quarter and the year-to-date periods. I plan on focusing your attention this morning mostly on the second quarter results. For those of you who are interested in the year-to-date comparison, you\u2019ll find that in the appendix. I will say that the drivers we discussed at length during the first quarter earnings call remain the drivers for the year-to-date results. For the company overall, operating earnings for the second quarter, was $390 million or $0.80 per share compared to $0.73 per share or $357 million recorded last year. These results when combined with the first quarter, pushed first half 2014 earnings to $950 million or $1.95 per share compared to $1.53 per share or $744 million earned in the first half 2013. Looking at the slide, you can see that each business segment is either equal to or above results recorded in 2013. With that as an overview, let me step you through the major earnings drivers by segment for the quarter on slide 6. Second quarter earnings for the vertically integrated utility segment were $0.31 per share this year comparable to the results of last year. Rate changes across many of our jurisdictions added $0.06 per share for the quarter. The increase in rates is a result of incremental investment made to serve our customers. Higher wholesale power prices and the availability of our generating fleet bolstered off system sales which benefited both customers and shareholders resulting in improved earnings in the second of $0.03 per share. Normalized retail margins contributed $0.01 per share to the year-over-year growth. Weather for the quarter was comparable to last year. The quarterly increase in margins was offset by higher O&M expense, depreciation and other items. The increase in O&M adversely affected the quarterly comparison by $0.07 due to higher generation maintenance cost, an increase in transmission service expense and higher employee related cost, partially offset by lower storm expense this year. The higher depreciation expense resulted from increased investment and plant, reducing earnings by $0.02 per share. The transmission and distribution utility segment earned $0.18 per share for the quarter, $0.03 higher than last year. Rate changes added $0.01 per share for the quarter and transmission revenues were higher due to customers who have switched suppliers in Ohio as well as the effect of increased investment. These favorable items were partially offset by higher O&M expense due to higher transmission, distribution and employee related costs. The transmission Holdco segment continues to grow, contributing $0.10 per share, a $0.06 improvement reflecting our continued significant investment in this area. From June of last year to June of this year, this segment\u2019s plan grew by nearly $1 billion, 92% increase. The generation and marketing segments earnings of $0.20 per share adds $0.02 to our quarterly comparison. This segment benefited from higher wholesale power prices and lower interest expense resulting from a very low weighted average cost of debt for generation resources. AEP River operations contributed $0.01 per share to earnings, $0.03 higher than our 2013 results due to improvements in demand for barge freight. Finally, corporate and other results were off $0.07 per share, primarily due to the interest income benefit recorded last year from the resolution of the U.K. Windfall tax item. In summary, our earnings performance during the quarter remained strong, largely due to a combined favorable $0.09 per share from our regulated segments. In addition the competitive segments also contributed to the year-over-year growth in earnings. These results along with a strong performance in the first quarter, allowed us to advance spending into 2014 from future years as we announced in April. This leaves us well positioned within the guidance range of $3.35 to $3.55 per share. Let\u2019s take a look at slide 7, where we can review normalized load trends for the quarter. As I made comments about industrial and total load on this slide, my remarks will adjust for the impact of the Ormet load. You will remember that Ormet, our largest customer at that time, ceased operations in the fourth quarter of 2013. The convention for adjusting for Ormet has meant to give a sense of how our industrial and total load are recovering in more of a going forward basis, since Ormet is not expected to return to production. In the charts, the numbers are presented with and without the affects of Ormet. Before we dig into the quarterly numbers, let me make some comments on year-to-date normalized loads. Every one of our operating companies experienced total normalized load increases year-to-date. The increases range from six tenths of a percent and at Appalachian and Wheeling Power to an impressive 4.6% at AEP Texas. In addition four of our seven operating companies experienced growth in all three retail classes. Turning to the quarterly comparisons, on the bottom right of the slide, you can see that overall weather normalized load was up 1.3%. This is being driven by industrial load which is up remarkable 4.5%. This marks the third consecutive quarter with positive growth in industrial sales. The company experienced growth in seven of our top 10 industrial sectors for the quarter, and nine of the top 10 for the year. The lone exception is coal mining which was down 3.5%. The quarterly sector leaders are pipeline transportation up 30.4%, chemical manufacturing our second largest sector up 11.1% and oil and gas extraction up 10.5%. We will talk more about the impacts of shale gas developments later. On the upper right of the slide, you will see that commercial sales were up four tenths of a percent for the quarter and have experienced positive growth for the last four quarters. We now believe that we\u2019re on track to match a positive annual comparison for the year, for the first time since 2008. Four of our top five commercial sectors have experienced year-to-date sales increases, the only exception being the retail trade sector which was down nearly 1%. On the upper left of the slide you will see that residential sales were down 1.5% for the quarter. While residential results varied by quarter, they are up year-to-date and are expected to be positive for the year. Turning to slide 8, let\u2019s review recent economic data for AEP service territory. Looking at estimated GDP for the quarter, growth for AEP at 3% continues to outperform that of the U.S. at 2.5%. On the upper right of the slide, you can see that economic growth in our Western footprint continues to outpace the U.S. and our Eastern service area which trails U.S. growth by 0.5%. In the bottom left quadrant, you will see the positive job growth in AEP service area, trials that of the U.S. as a whole by four tenths of a percent. Similar to GDP growth, job growth and AEP\u2019s Western territories, outpaces both the U.S. and AEP\u2019s Eastern service areas. For AEP, we have experienced strong employment gains in the natural resources and mining, leisure and hospitality, construction and manufacturing sectors. With that segue, let\u2019s turn to slide 9, to see how big of an impact the U.S. shale gas developments is to AEP\u2019s industrial growth. In the first quarter of 2014, we thought that it was notable that industrial sales and AEP shale counties grew by 30% versus non-shale counties which had decreases of 1.7%. For the second quarter, that contrast becomes even more pronounced as industrial sales in our shale counties increased by a dramatic 39% over last year\u2019s second quarter. And our non-shale counties on industrial sales decreased of 1.6%. This shale county, surge in industrial sales are significant for AEP because 17% of our industrial sales are located in shale gas counties. The bottom chart segments, industrial sales growth by major shale regions. As you can see in our Eastern footprint industrial sales are growing fastest in the Utica, Marcellus regions and our Western footprint we are fastest in the Permian and Woodford regions, while sales are down in the Eagle Ford region. Looking forward, we are anticipating significant oil and gas related load increases in our shale footprint. We have recently updated our share related load forecast and the incremental capacity requirements through the end of the decade have increased by over 20%. In Ohio, the Department of Natural Resources has just announced that from 2012 to 2013, oil production in the state increased 62% and natural gas production increased 97%. In addition, the ODNR noted that general drilling permits issued in the state were 583 in 2013 and are expected to grow to 700 this year and to 800 in 2015. Turning to slide 10, let\u2019s review the financial health of the company. Our debt to total capital remains unchanged relative to last quarter at 54.2%. Our credit metrics, FFO interest coverage and FFO to debt have improved modestly from last quarter and remains solidly in the BBB and BAA1 range at five times and 20.3% respectively. Our qualified pension is now fully funded at 100%. This is great news for our customers, employees, retirees and investors and reflects significant investment in and de-risking of the plan over the last five years. This is noteworthy given that our pension funding stood at 73% at the end of 2008 and was only 82% funded at the end of 2010. The weighted average during of the assets now more closely matches that of the liabilities at about 10.2 years. And at 100% funding, our targeted allocation of fixed income assets rises to 60% from its current allocation of 55%. We plan to make contributions to the plan at roughly the estimated annual service cost of about $75 million. Finally, our liquidity stands at about $2.9 billion, and are supported by a two revolving credit facilities that extended into the summers of 2016 and 2017. We have worked hard over the last several years to achieve the financial strength demonstrated on this slide, and believe that we are well positioned for the future. Turning to slide 11, let\u2019s see if I can wrap this thing up. The company is off to a strong first half of 2014. For the quarter, all of our business segments were equal to or greater than last year\u2019s results. And for the year-to-date, all of our business segments exceeded last year\u2019s numbers. On top of those results, we are executing on our commitments. We previously stated that we were going to accelerate transmission investment when possible, expand our LEAN and continuous improvement initiatives and shift cost out of 2016 and into 2014 where it makes sense. I\u2019ll spend a few moments giving an update on the progress we\u2019ve made on those commitments. First, starting with the goal of accelerating transmission investment. In addition to the $200 million increase that we announced after the first quarter, our year-to-date results give us the confidence and the cash to advance another $100 million into 2014. This increased investment will fund NERC-mandated projects, reliability projects related to generation retirements and new customer connections. This will bring our forecasted 2014 transmission capital spend to a total $1.9 billion. In regards to the continuous improvement efforts, employees have now completed lean initiatives at seven of our generating plants with plans to complete an additional five during 2014. Our DC Cook Nuclear Plant also started deploying LEAN earlier this year. Seven of our 32 distribution districts have completed their initiatives with six starting in July and scheduled to be completed this year. The first of five regions in transmission field operations started LEAN in this month. In addition, numerous corporate groups such as IT, supply-chain, procurement and fleet and commercial operations are applying LEAN principles and practices. In places where employees have engaged in LEAN initiatives, we have identified cost savings through more efficient work practices and better utilization of the contractor workforce. Finally, in regards to the cost-shifting initiatives, we have accelerated approximately $60 million of expenses from 2016 into 2014. This means that our customers would get the benefit of those activities sooner than initially planned and that means that the company can produce \u2013 can prudently manage with some of the benefits of the strong 2014 earnings have allowed. Most of these costs are being shifted in the second half of 2014, and include activities related to plant outages and other customer focused activity. It is fair to conclude that the company is making progress on its commitments in these areas. Finally, we are reaffirming our 2014 operating earnings guidance range of $3.35 to $3.55 per share. We are pleased with our earnings performance for the first half of the year, mindful of a mild start to the summer and confident in our ability to perform within the range. With that, I will turn the call over to the operator for your questions. Operator : (Operator Instructions). And our first question will come from the line of Hugh Wynne, Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead. Hugh Wynne \u2013 Sanford Bernstein : Good morning. Nick Akins : How are you? Hugh Wynne \u2013 Sanford Bernstein : Very well. Congratulations on a strong quarter. Nick Akins : Thanks. Hugh Wynne \u2013 Sanford Bernstein : I wanted to follow up a little bit on your comments on the new proposed regulation on CO2. And I was wondering if I could maybe draw you out a little bit on how you see the rule being implemented in the states where you have generation? I appreciate that you\u2019re submitting comments and that the rule will be changed, but are you anticipating any particular form of regulation in the major states where you have coal-fired power plants? Brian Tierney : Yes, so, that\u2019s a great question. And I don\u2019t know if I have a good answer at this point. I\u2019m not sure anybody does. We\u2019re working extensively and have outreach to all of our states, trying to understand exactly what this plan means. And even our generation, we\u2019re just a part of each state that we serve. And that\u2019s what I stress, these are state plans. So, we\u2019re going through the process with them of understanding the generation is out there, the commitments made around the generation. What that means to the overall plan for the state in response. And some of our states obviously have taken a very aggressive in terms of litigation. And it remains to be seen how that whole process will work out. I think this plan is more far reaching than anything that\u2019s ever occurred before. And when you change dispatch order of units within states, when you change resources within states and give guidelines that are fully significant, that really minimizes the other options available, it really makes it challenging for the states. And that\u2019s something that we\u2019re trying to work through the process to fully understand. We\u2019ll get back with EPA on the facts that we see from a state by state perspective and have discussions about it and specific examples of areas that are of concern. And we\u2019ll have to work it out. But I really can\u2019t tell you what the process is at this point. As you know the rule provides for 2017 and then 2018 if the states decide to get together which then would be interesting in itself. And as one participant in part of that overall plan, it\u2019s hard to imagine how these things are all going to come together in that timeframe. And then many of the requirements really hit in 2020. So you really don\u2019t have much time, probably not enough time to get what you need done. So, this thing has a wrong way to play out. I think certainly the comments that the EPA are critical and certainly the EPA needs to be cognizant that these states are dealing with very, very detailed, very complicated issues and also the companies involved. So, Hugh, that\u2019s a long answer \u2013 long way of saying we don\u2019t know at this point. Hugh Wynne \u2013 Sanford Bernstein : I appreciate your time on that. Thank you very much. Have a good day. Brian Tierney : Yes. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs, please go ahead. Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs : Hi guys, congrats on a good quarter and also want to thank you. I know you implemented at the beginning of the year, but for the new disclosure methodology, it makes understanding AEP a little bit easier to do. Nick Akins : Brian\u2019s happy about that comment. Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs : One question on the transmission side, you did those in the first quarter and now you\u2019re doing it again in terms of updating your transmission capital spending guidance for the year. Can you give us a little more insight on where that spending is occurring, meaning either specific jurisdictions, specific Transco, or even whether it\u2019s just embedded within the VIU, T&I, or is it actually at the Transco sub? Just trying to tie together your CapEx versus your segments. Nick Akins : Yes, it\u2019s occurring all over the place. But primarily in Ohio, Oklahoma and Indiana, and there are RTO mandated projects, there are other projects, reliability projects, customer connect projects. And about \u2013 is our call about 75% of the mix was in the Transco\u2019s and 25% was in the regulated operated companies. So, this is all block and tackle, mandate and spending and we have a list of projects and it\u2019s not block. We\u2019re just allocating another $100 million that the transmission say go find something. We have a list of what exactly those projects are by individual project. And I know Brian\u2019s like 20 to 25 separate projects on the page that certainly show the detail. Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs : Yes. Does this mean that you\u2019re moving stuff that you had planned on doing in \u201915, \u201916 and \u201917 into 2014? So maybe \u201914 CapEx, you\u2019re kind of accelerating the earnings power, but you\u2019re not necessarily making, I don\u2019t know, for year five earnings power higher? Or is this an increase in capital spending if you think about three to five year budget? Nick Akins : Yes. So, it is obviously first of all taking care of that green section of the graph that, the incremental transmission that we had for the year. And then we also advanced some projects from future years into this year. But that doesn\u2019t meant that all those, there is no additional identified projects along the way. There is a lot of other activity going on. The green sections were only defined projects that we knew exactly what they were and where they would be done. And then, of course the work continues on continued rehabilitation of the grid from a transmission perspective and additional projects. So, while it\u2019s advanced from future years, that doesn\u2019t mean that there won\u2019t incremental projects as well. Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs : Okay, and last item. Great. Brian, this may be more of a detailed one, on the O&M change for 2014 you\u2019ve talked about, can you reiterate what\u2019s the amount? You said that it\u2019s largely going to be second half of 2014. In which parts of the business is that actually impacting, meaning VIU, T&I, elsewhere? Nick Akins : It\u2019s going to impact all of them Michael. It\u2019s about $60 million and it\u2019s going to impact the vertical integrated utilities and APGR in terms of planned outages. And it\u2019s going to impact all of them in terms of \u2013 it\u2019s going to impact vertically integrated utilities and transmission distribution utilities in terms of some transmission forestry spend that we\u2019re going to do. And then there are other customer related projects that will be in all other segments that we deal with where we\u2019ll be trying to pull those costs forward. Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs : So its costs that you will pull forward into 2014, but therefore wouldn\u2019t necessarily have recurring in 2015? Nick Akins : Yes, it\u2019s really. We\u2019re trying to take those \u201916 cost out because we have that challenge associated with the capacity revenue fall-off in 2016. So, we\u2019re trying to take cost out of \u201916 and pull them into \u201914 and then not have those costs be recurring again in 2016. So, if it\u2019s plant outages, if we can get ahead on transmission tree trimming that we then get the benefits of that for our customers in 2014, but will have better resulting spend happening in 2016 to help us fill that gap. Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs : Got it. Thank you. Much appreciated and congratulations on a good quarter. Nick Akins : Sure, thanks. Operator : Your next question is from Dan Eggers from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Dan Eggers \u2013 Credit Suisse : Hi, good morning. Nick Akins : Hi Dan, good morning. Dan Eggers \u2013 Credit Suisse : Listen, I guess, just, Nick, going back to your comment on the Ohio generation, you said you\u2019ll address it in a timely fashion and enhance shareholder value. Can you give an update on progress you\u2019re seeing as far as long-term contracting of those assets as an alternative to keeping them? And then with the pullback in power prices and that sort of thing, is that having a bearing on potentially delaying when you guys would want to do something hoping for a better environment, particularly after AES pulled their project? Nick Akins : Well, the way we look at it, the way we originally told you I guess last year or a year before. We\u2019re looking for certain things. And certainly the hedging of that generation is critical. Certainly from maybe retail and the wholesale side, we continue to work on the PPA issue in Ohio focused on trying to bring some sensibility around the risk that customers are taking on in Ohio. And certainly the market areas that we\u2019ve been working on with PJM and others to enhance capacity and then with the energy markets themselves and improving on average. Those are all things that help us determine what the future of that business look like. And obviously we\u2019re not just stopping there we\u2019re looking at all the cost structures around that business. And really treating it like any other investor would treat it. So, it\u2019s really important for us to reach those milestones to fully understand what the valuation of that business looks like in the future. And then, the one thing we have is time to focus on those activities and make a decision. All along the way, we\u2019re keeping our board up-to-date on what market conditions look like, what the areas look like in terms of the options available to us. And that\u2019s all I\u2019m saying, at that point is we will decide what to do with that business when we feel like the time is right to make sure we maximize shareholder value. Dan Eggers \u2013 Credit Suisse : So, that sounds like 2014 will be consumed with, or part of 2014 will be consumed with making a decision. But there\u2019s not actually anything getting done this year? Brian Tierney : Yes, the 2014 obviously is a year where certain milestones have to come into place. I mean, we have several \u2013 we\u2019ve already gone through a capacity auction that was improved. We still have some changes that are permeating through PJM with the demand curve and so forth. We\u2019ve got other things we\u2019re doing with it and we believe that in 2015 like I mentioned with 80% that capacity running, it\u2019s going to retire mid-\u201915. So, the very real impacts of the retirements that generation is going to be reflected through the capacity and energy markets. So that will give us a real view of what that valuation looks like. And also, from a call standpoint, Chuck Zebula is doing everything he can do down to get the cost structure itself down. And with the LEAN activities, the plants are running very differently than what they ran in the past. So, all those things are coming together. And 2014 is a year where we\u2019re going through the process, determining what the milestones are and what the options are available. Dan Eggers \u2013 Credit Suisse : Okay. Thank you for that. And I guess, just one other question on kind of the load growth trends : obviously, there\u2019s a lot of enthusiasm in the first quarter. And trying to decipher between weather and usage was a question, and we saw residential taper off comparably in the second quarter. How are you feeling about the outlook for demand growth kind of beyond 2014 and are you as encouraged today as you might of been, say, at the end of the first quarter? Nick Akins : I\u2019d say, we\u2019re just as encouraged because you look at residential for example, quarter by quarter I mean, it was pretty high change in first quarter and then it shows a slight decrease in second quarter. A lot of times, residential sort of gets skewed from quarter to quarter based on whether it be holidays, whether it be areas where we\u2019re having to residential parties maybe dealing with their loads in different fashions and different parts of the year because you could have like last year there was that federal furlough that was done that people stayed home, residential went up. So this year, it sort of shows it goes down during this time last year. So, if things like that that will make the residential sort of come in and out each quarter. I tend to look more at the averages of residential load. You don\u2019t see that so much with commercial and industrial loads. And with commercial, showing a consistently positive and then in particular the industrial continues to expand, expands more every quarter. That\u2019s a good thing because we\u2019ve always said industrial leads commercial, commercial leads residential. So I think it\u2019s a good indicator for the future. Dan Eggers \u2013 Credit Suisse : Okay. Thank you, guys. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Paul Ridzon \u2013 KeyBanc: Just kind of on Dan\u2019s question, just on the Ohio generation, is an outcome in Ohio around the PPA a gating issue for your decision? Nick Akins : I think certainly its part of the decision process. But I think the real reason why we\u2019re doing the PPA arrangement. Number one, is bring some stability to the generation in Ohio, the second reason obviously is our customers, all right, we\u2019re asking terms of the volatility of the market. So, it\u2019s important for us to get some measure of that in place. It\u2019s just like you buy fuel or anything else or stock, you\u2019re in for the long-term, you\u2019re in for the short term. Long-term capacity and energy needs to be there in Ohio. For the first time, Ohio is short and Ohio is going to be a purchaser on the market if it\u2019s not careful in reinforcing the value of this generation. So, yes, it\u2019s a big part of the decision process for us, because you make very different decisions about generation, unless you have long-term purchase power arrangements whether they\u2019re formula-based rate or within the retail side that we\u2019re talking about. So, there is an opportunity there. And I think there is legitimate concern on the part of many including the industrials. And they should be concerned. And that\u2019s something I think that we\u2019re focused on answering that question during this year. Paul Ridzon \u2013 KeyBanc: And just switching gears, the cost shift from \u201816 to \u201814, should we think about that as allowing you to get to the 4% or 6% or bring you comfortably within that 4% to 6% growth 2015 to 2016? Brian Tierney : I think all of the activities that we talked about doing, the LEAN initiatives, the cost shifting and the incremental transmission spend are meant to have us inside that range. Paul Ridzon \u2013 KeyBanc: Okay. Thank you. Brian Tierney : There are a number of other factors that will impact where we land in that range. And they are the normal factors that you normally think about. Load growth, our ability to contain cost and wholesale energy pricing. And also keep in mind that what we\u2019ve done so far is what we\u2019ve been able to identify in the prospects of what\u2019s happened so far from LEAN activities and so forth. So, as far as 2016 is concerned, we still have a lot more work to do. I mean, we obviously wouldn\u2019t have put our guidance for \u201816 if we didn\u2019t feel comfortable within that range. Where we\u2019re at within the range is, it will be a measure of how much work we can get done from this year, end of \u201815, end of \u201816. And then obviously in November, we\u2019re going to give a view of what we see happening with additional guidance that we provide then. Paul Ridzon \u2013 KeyBanc: Thank you very much. Brian Tierney : Yes. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Stephen Bryd from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Nick Akins : Good morning, Stephen. Stephen Byrd \u2013 Morgan Stanley : Good morning. You gave some good color in the presentation on the growth of shale gas activity. Is the kind of growth that we\u2019re seeing, is this in line with your expectations? Is it accelerating above your expectations? Can you give a little more color on the degree of activity that you\u2019re seeing? Nick Akins : I think in some cases it\u2019s above our expectations because and I know I heard the other day our President in AEP Texas said that we have in the last year put in like 20, 25 \u2013 about 25 substations in that territory, which means we\u2019re connecting a lot of load. And we\u2019re doing in terms of transmission, the substation in a box we call it but the skid stations, so that we can connect these customers more quickly, we\u2019re expanding that effort because we definitely want to keep up with the expansion that\u2019s occurring. So, I\u2019d say it\u2019s ahead of expectations in the areas and it\u2019s probably at expectations than others. Brian Tierney : Stephen, one of the things that we saw last year was lot of the shale gas load that we expected to come on earlier in the year last year did not come on until later in the year. And whether that\u2019s logistics problems, permitting problems or whatever it was, it was stacked up and really didn\u2019t come in until later last year, earlier this year. As we\u2019re looking forward, our shale gas related forecasts are actually increasing from the base that we had. And as we look to the end of the decade, we just had to increase our load forecasts for those regions by 20% given some updates that we\u2019ve had on some of the developments in those areas. Stephen Byrd \u2013 Morgan Stanley : Okay. And just wanted to speak about that increase in the supply, we\u2019ve seen a lot of volatility in local gas prices. Do you have a point of view on the impact, either near-term or long-term, just on all this increase in shale gas and what that might mean for local gas prices versus what we might see quoted on Henry Hub? Brian Tierney : Yes, we\u2019re seeing some pretty significant basis differentials around our combined cycle gas plants. Waterford for instance which takes off with Texas Eastern and Zone M2, has frequently been trading at a significant discount to Henry Hub with our Lawrenceburg plant, which is on Texas gas translation zone 4 is frequently trading at $0.25 premium to Henry Hub. So, even in our own service territory, areas that are not that far apart, Indiana to Eastern Ohio, we\u2019re seeing some pretty significant basis differentials. When you\u2019re in the production area and you don\u2019t have the infrastructure to take the gas out of the production area, we\u2019re awash in gas and its depressing prices in places where you don\u2019t have those constraints and you\u2019re pulling from the Gulf, you\u2019re trading at a traditional premium to the Henry Hub. So, it\u2019s impacting local prices pretty significantly at our service area. Nick Akins : Little caution on that, when you look at the volatility of processing, it\u2019s a matter of perspective how much of the processes are coming off. It\u2019s still hard in our coal prices and when you look at the retirements that are about to occur next year, you really wonder what it\u2019s going to do to natural gas prices going forward. And even it depends on even more with the Clean Power Plant, it\u2019s \u2013 it will be amazing to see what the affect could be because I think the price is moving around in a relatively thin volume level. So you see storage creeping up a little bit, well, it wouldn\u2019t take a hot summer, we\u2019d lose storage if there is a hot September. But when you retire generation, particularly that\u2019s running as much as that generation is running, it\u2019s going to move the natural gas and I would probably expect energy processes move up as a result. Stephen Byrd \u2013 Morgan Stanley : Great. Thanks much for the color. I appreciate it. Nick Akins : Yes. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Paul Patterson from Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead. Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates : Good morning. Nick Akins : Good morning. Brian Tierney : Good morning. Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates : Not to specifically ask about M&A, but there is, in Texas, a utility that looks like it\u2019s for sale, potentially, and you guys are in Texas. But, also, you made some comments in your opening statement about potential M&A and what you were looking for, and I\u2019m just sort of wondering about the potential deployment of leverage and whether or not you see opportunities such as Encore or what have you? Nick Akins : Yes. So, I guess first of all the patent M&A 101 answer, we look at a lot of things. But certainly when you make a decision like that it continues to be more of a strategic move. And with the amount of transmission spend that we have available to us with like I said with no premium. And I fully expect the Texas process to be pretty robust. It remains to be seen how that process is actually going to work out. And in fact, who all is involved with it. But our course of action is what we know today. And that\u2019s focused on the transmission investment that we have indigenous that we can continue to improve earnings per share for our shareholders. And anything else beyond that would have to be something that achieves a strategic hurdle that overcomes the transmission spend, and that\u2019s a hard thing to do these days. Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates : Okay. And then I just wanted to turn back to sort of Ohio and this PPA rider. And just sort of generically speaking, what the interaction you guys are having, generally speaking with officials in Ohio and their thoughts about fuel diversity, what the market is providing them? And their appetite or their policy perspective on potentially going for something like the PPA rider or what have you, sort of a hybrid situation, in terms of if they want to have more fuel diversity or what have or if they\u2019re willing to sort of just go pure market kind of thing? Just what kind of, incrementally, what have you been getting from, as you get further in the process from the officials in Ohio? Nick Akins : I think there is legitimate concern. What happens, I think probably the \u2013 you already have a test case out there with the ESP filing that we made last December that has a PPA for the OVEC generation. The staff recommended against it but they said well, commission, if you decide to do this, this is how to do it. So, basically they plan into the commission. And it will be a matter of the public policy in Ohio what the result winds up being. But that would be a clear indicator and you probably would see more of that as we go forward. Because there is a huge amount of generation out there that is at risk. And from an Ohio perspective, it needs to be locked in, in some fashion. Now that might not be all of it but certainly just as you do with any other portfolio, there needs to be a long-term approach. And for Ohio, it depends upon PJM market conditions to preserve some sense of lack of volatility for customers. That would be a huge error. So, we continue to have discussions and there are obviously others like industrials you\u2019re concerned about it, from an economic development perspective in Ohio. There is concern about from that perspective. And we\u2019ll continue to save the tree on that. And I think that\u2019s important for us to progress. So I\u2019d see that playing out this year. Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates : Okay. Any sense of any sort of timing, I mean, you said this year, but I\u2019m just wondering, do you think, is it going to be just basically, should we just check out the ESP process or do you think there might be another way this might manifest itself? Brian Tierney : Well, I think certainly the ESP case is a clear indicator because that may be the first thing that the commission actually deals with. But there could be other filings that we would make as a result as well. Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates : Okay. Thanks a lot. I appreciate it. Nick Akins : Yes. Operator : Our next question is from Ali Agha from SunTrust. Please go ahead. Ali Agha \u2013 SunTrust: Thank you. Good morning. Nick Akins : Good morning. Ali Agha \u2013 SunTrust: I wanted to clarify a couple of points. First, on the transmission side, so, on the slide that you all lay out for us, the base case and the high case. So, just to be clear, if I look at the 2016 numbers, you still have about a $0.06 differential earnings-wise between base and high. So does some of the incremental investment that you\u2019ve made capture that, or when should we see that $0.06 starting to get captured visibly from our side? Nick Akins : Yes, so you should, you should it\u2019s inclusive in that. And you should see that rolling through when the projects are completed. Brian Tierney : With a very short lag that we have on translation spend if we make incremental this year, you\u2019ll start to see that in earnings next year. Ali Agha \u2013 SunTrust: I see. Okay. Secondly, on your Ohio thinking, Nick, as you laid out various milestones, etcetera. Is it still a scenario for you to look at that portfolio and think of either a tax-free spin-off, or a sale to unlock some equity value? Is that still something you\u2019re considering, or is the focus primarily on trying to make it, as \u201cyou\u2019d really like as possible\u201d? Nick Akins : I think all those options are still open because we have to credibly look at this business, do everything we can to fortify the value of it. And the make decisions about what the optionality is concerning that set of businesses. And I think I mean, we\u2019re looking at that in terms of maximizing shareholder value and you have to look at all the options when you do that. Ali Agha \u2013 SunTrust: Okay. If I heard you right, the EEI is probably not the forum where you\u2019d give us your strategic conclusion, but maybe year-end earnings for next year, would that be the time frame we should be looking at? Nick Akins : Well, I certainly would be hesitant to talk about the timing of that. I doubt that we\u2019ll be saying anything about the disposition of our decisions on those particular assets at that point in time. November would really be a time where we focus on the guidance for the forward looking years. So, you\u2019ll see a new version of that. But in terms of \u2013 in terms of the end regulated generation, we\u2019ll have to see how the processes are moved through in Ohio and other areas. Ali Agha \u2013 SunTrust: Okay. Last question, can you just remind us for budgeting and planning purposes, what is the weather-normalized load growth you assume for this year and normalized longer-term? Nick Akins : Yes, so when in our budget for this year, we were assuming negative 1.1% including format and excluding format positive one tenths of a percent. Obviously as we\u2019ve come in hotter for the first half of the year, weather normalized we would be off those numbers today. And we generally don\u2019t reforecast what the individual components going into the guidance once we get into the year. We had been forecasting negative five tenths of a percent to positive five tenths of a percent in our guidance. And we will be revisiting that as we work our way towards putting together more formalized guidance at EEI. Ali Agha \u2013 SunTrust: Thanks Brian, thank you. Brian Tierney : Thank you. We probably have question time for one more question operator. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Greg Gordon from ISI Group. Please go ahead. Greg Gordon \u2013 ISI Group : Thanks guys. I\u2019ll make it quick since you\u2019ve answered a lot of, just stopped by. I wanted to ask the \u2013 looking at one of your slides, year-to-date you\u2019ve put 36% of your volumes at the Generation Resources business into the spot market. Obviously you\u2019ve done very well because we had a lot of volatility in the first and second quarter but prices are off quite a bit. Did you take advantage of higher prices out the forward curve in the second quarter to hedge out better prices, some of your load for next year or do you expect to run substantively open again? Nick Akins : Yes, they\u2019re continually hedging in the market. And really those hedges have continued to be of benefit to us. Greg Gordon \u2013 ISI Group : And my question is, did you take advantage of higher prices out the forward curve that kind of \u2013 that have since fallen off precipitously to change the mix of what you might be putting into the spot market next year? Brian Tierney : Greg, we\u2019ve taken some advantage of that. But a significant portfolio of that portfolio is going to be open to spot markets going forward, probably in that 30% to 40% range. Greg Gordon \u2013 ISI Group : Okay, thanks guys. Take care. Nick Akins : Yes, okay. Operator : Thank you. And please go ahead with any closing remarks. Julie Sherwood : That\u2019s all. You can give the replay information please. Operator : Okay, thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, this conference will be made available for replay after 11 :15 today through August 1.

Welcome to the American Electric Power Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, the call is being recorded. And now I'll turn the conference over to Ms. Bette Jo Rozsa. Please go ahead. Bette Jo Rozsa : Thank you, John. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the third quarter 2014 earnings webcast of American Electric Power. Our earnings release, presentation slides and related financial information are available on our website at aep.com. Today, we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors. Joining me this morning for opening remarks are Nick Akins, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Tierney, our Chief Financial Officer. We will take your questions following their remarks. I will now turn the call over to Nick. Nicholas K. Akins: Thanks, Bette Jo. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today on our third quarter 2014 earnings call. As I go through the story this quarter, I would say that, overall, it was actually an impressive quarter to come in at a respectable $1.01 per share and consistent with guidance given the headwinds of this being the sixth-mildest winter that we've had here in our service territory in 30 years and the intentional O&M advance spending that we described for you earlier in the year that we have continued. Our continued emphasis on regulated investments, particularly in the transmission area, that we then disciplined with advance spending from 2016 into 2014 and '15. And the focus on operating company performance continues to define the trajectory of consistent, dependable financial and operational performance. Keep in mind, we are in the middle of a multiyear plan to reposition our company, focused on infrastructure investments, particularly in the transmission and regulated utility lines of our business, improving our customer service through process and technology improvements, transforming our generation resources and defining an employee culture that enables the adaptability, flexibility and entrepreneurship that the future will demand. I would like to reiterate that this is a multiyear plan that began in 2013 focused on consistent earnings and dividend improvement. And we are still on target within the plan we laid out at EEI 2 years ago. We are taking advantage of opportunities around incremental transmission investments, advanced O&M spending made available from the first quarter performance and continue to drive efficiencies as we redefine processes through employee-led lean initiatives. All of these activities serve to mitigate the impacts of the, for lack of a better description, growing pains of dealing with the negative circumstances of the 2016 PJM capacity auction and Ohio deregulation-induced financial impacts. These mitigation activities have enabled the continued confirmation of our previous guidance ranges and growth rates for the 2014 to '16 period. There will no doubt be some growing pains, such as potential regulatory lag conditions or settlements that may reduce front-end revenues to accommodate longer-term business plan gains or the potential for mismatches between O&M efficiency gains and earnings test. These are examples of headwinds that may temper our earnings growth, but our investment strategy and the agility to compensate along the way continue to confirm our earnings trajectory. We will discuss this in more detail in November at the upcoming EEI Conference. I'm pleased to report that we are nearing the range for our 2014 guidance, the $3.40 to $3.50 per share from $3.35 to $3.55 per share as we tune in toward the end of the year. As I mentioned earlier, our GAAP and operating earnings for the quarter came in at $1.01 per share, and for the -- year-to-date earnings stand at $2.95 per share. This compares with third quarter 2013 GAAP earnings of $0.89 per share and $1.10 per share operating earnings. And year-to-date 2013 GAAP earnings were $2.33 per share and $2.63 operating earnings. AEP's Board of Directors also recently declared a dividend increase of $0.03 per share to $0.53 per share for the quarter, which represents a 6% annualized increase indicating their continued confidence in our business plan performance. Load growth in our service territory continues especially in the industrial sector, while there has been some commercial growth, and residential growth is still lagging. This segment will likely take time to recover and needs consistency with industrial and commercial growth. Both the industrial and commercial sectors have experienced several quarters of growth, so we'll be watching these metrics closely for trends. Brian will cover this subject in more detail in a few minutes. Briefly covering some of the regulatory activities that are ongoing, starting with the Ohio PPA filing that we made in October. This filing request approval from the PUCO to allow AEP Ohio to enter into a PPA arrangement with AEP Generation Resources for 100% of AEP Generation Resources share of several Ohio-based generating units, amounting to about 2,671 megawatts, and it's for the life of these units. This PPA would be separate but additional to the already requested OVEC generation through a PPA rider, which would be approved in the ESP 3 filing that is presently before the commission. These generating units represent about 1/3 of the Ohio-deregulated fleet. Placing these units in a PPA will preserve Ohio jobs, tax base, and more importantly, provide a hedge to Ohio customers to mitigate price increases in the future. We estimate that this PPA arrangement will save customers approximately $224 million over the next 10 years and will provide the stability of revenues to maintain and invest in these generating units, a true win-win. We already have PPA arrangements with other resources, such as renewables and energy efficiency. And the PPA rider is legal given that SB 221 allows for non-bypassable riders of this sort. AEP has asked for expedited approval by June 1 of next year. In our continued efforts to benefit our regulated jurisdictions with the transfer of Ohio-deregulated assets that were depended upon previously to satisfy capacity requirements through the AEP generation pool, we now have a settlement in West Virginia for the transfer of 100% of the 50% interest in the Mitchell plant into the rate base of Wheeling Power. This is a proposed settlement and subject to the UI [ph] commission approval. But it states that only 82.5% will go into rates initially with the other 17.5% going to rates no later than January 1, 2020. Until then, the 17.5% will essentially function in the deregulated market where the proceeds for capacity, energy and other services will accrue to the benefit of shareholders, much like off-system sales. There will also be an off-system sales sharing mechanism in place for the regulated 82.5% of generation as well as other provisions in the settlement as well. A hearing was held on October 21, and we await a commission decision. This is a good agreement in which taking a short-term risk with the 17.5% was worth the long-term benefits toward our regulated business plan. So before I go into the PJM market reform, and for that matter, the EPA Clean Power Plan, I'll now go to the equalizer chart, which usually is what I call it, on the next page. So as we go through the individual jurisdictions, and I'll sort of characterize this against last quarter as well, this thing tends to be a snapshot from quarter-to-quarter. And as you can probably see and have seen from the last quarter, the overall ROE has come down. This is the regulated entities, remember. So -- and most cases -- and I'm probably going to be redundant when I go through this is, is most of the impact that you see relative to lower ROEs is because of the advanced O&M spend that we had previously put in place, which we've continued to do because we did get ahead in the first quarter and were able to take on that additional expense, and also the unfavorable weather for the quarter. As I said earlier, it was one of the coolest summers we've had in decades. So in fact, in July, I think it was the coldest July we've had since 1979. So definitely, we've absorbed some things, and that's what driven down the ROEs in general for that period of time. Because of the unregulated generation revenues from the first quarter, the effective ROE would be, certainly be higher than that for the -- and above the 10%. So we have -- we've come along very well. We continue to make progress, and as I go through some of these jurisdictions, we'll talk about some of the issues going on. So starting with Ohio power. Last quarter, it was at 14%. And as we told you last time, it was heading down to get -- toward the SEET levels. And it continues to do that. It's at the 12.6% level this quarter, and we continue to make progress in that regard. As far as APCo is concerned, APCo is at 8.3%. And it was low last quarter as well at 8.5%. So there has been some weather-adjusted activities and O&M activities, but the main issue there is we have a West Virginia rate case that has been filed in that jurisdiction for $226 million. $45 million of that is a vegetation management rider, and the earned ROE for West Virginia is really where we have the issue. It's approximately 5.8% as filed in the rate case. So we have a lot of work to do in the West Virginia jurisdiction. Virginia, we believe, is certainly within the earnings collar that exists based on that legislation. So our issue there is West Virginia. We know that, and we're working on it. In Kentucky, the ROE is certainly -- continues to be a challenge, but there has been some improvement. It was 7.4%. It's up to 8.4% this quarter, primarily because of off-system sales. But obviously, we're in the process of working through to file a rate case at the end of 2014 that will reflect the full recovery of Mitchell. And that case is expected to be effective in July of 2015. So that's a work in progress as well. For I&M. I&M came down from 10.8% to 9.1%. And the biggest driver there was the 2014 earnings were much lower because of the unfavorable O&M and weather-related conditions. And then as far as PSO is concerned, PSO actually came down from 9.1% to 8.3%, again because of weather and the Western footprint. Weather was significantly off. And of course, a lot of the O&M spend also occurred at PSO as well. They also have a settlement of their rate case that's before the commission as well. And then, SWEPCO. SWEPCO will continue to be a challenge because of the portion of Turk that is not in a rate base yet, but we do have a supportive PFD from the Texas Commission at this point relative to transmission expense. And we continue to look for improvement there. But it'll take time to get the Turk portion worked out. Probably, it'll be some time -- it'll probably impact earnings in 2016 before we're able to go after resolution of that issue. And then as far as AEP Texas is concerned, they're still hanging out there at that 12.4%, and that really reflects the stranded cost issues that we've talked about, recovery issues we talked about earlier. And then the AEP Transco is doing very well. Transmission Holdco has returned, is at the 11.4%, which is in line with its authorized return. Now it's at 11.9%, so doing very well from a transmission perspective. So as we move forward, let me go ahead and cover the PJM market and the EPA Clean Power Plan. There's been much discussion regarding the PJM capacity market reform, particularly regarding the PJM capacity performance proposal and their demand resource white paper. As a general concept, we agree with the approaches, as we have said earlier, that adequate and consistent price signals need to be provided so that generation can be maintained and additional investment made. Regarding the capacity proposal, PJM is looking at placing some limitations on clearing price volatility, which would be a positive move. And progress appears to be -- been made with regard to the severity of the proposed penalty provisions. We disagree with PJM regarding the applicability of penalty provisions on FRR entities, such as our fully integrated regulated space, because they have resource responsibility. We are working with others to develop comments to these proposals before PJM files for FERC by December 1. Regarding the DR demand resource white paper proposals, the current thinking is that DR will participate on the demand side with the load-serving entities. So DR will realize the benefits from avoided costs and reserve requirements instead of direct payments from the auctions. However, FERC will need to provide direction on the DR issue as they respond to the DC Circuit Court order. So stay tuned as many of these capacity auction-related issues are addressed, but we believe significant auction issues are finally being discussed and expect improvements to be made. Our previously discussed AEP's thoughts regarding the EPA's proposed Clean Power Plan. Generally, the cornerstone assumptions are not realistic. The timetables are much too aggressive. And it's just too complicated for the states, markets and stakeholders to comprehend without a well-thought-out plan for development and execution. The EPA's proposed rules will generally require a fundamental change in the way the electric grid, capacity and energy markets and the state review and approval processes function. For those of us like myself, who grew up planning, building and running the power system of today, it is the backbone of everything we do in society. We happen to take the continued reliable operation of the power system seriously. I instructed my team here at AEP to run system planning and performance studies, typically known as load-flow studies, that engineers use to plan and confirm the reliable operation of the grid. And I asked them to assume the EPA 2020 cornerstone assumptions and add generation that's included in the PJM Q. The results of those studies found widespread occurrences of voltage degradation, collapse, and in fact, cascading outages of the electric grid. These results are even before any contingency outages, such as loss of generation or transmission facilities. The Southwest Power Pool ran their own studies and confirmed the same results for their region of the country, which we also serve. FERC should require NERC and the RTOs to perform these studies as they will no doubt confirm the same results. But proper technical analysis needs to be done as a part of the review of the EPA-proposed plan so that we can arrive at a rational result that enables progress from an environmental perspective with a more balanced set of resources, while at the same time preserving the reliable grid we have today. If you hear someone say the proposed plan is okay, they probably have not run a load-flow or stability study of the system and have either depended upon a market study or some other generalization. There is a better way to meet our environmental objectives by working together at commonsense solutions. The 2020 timetable requirements must be dropped and the states be given the flexibility to do the proper analysis to formulate plans. They -- this will provide not only operationally efficient results but also financially efficient results as we achieve the environmental solutions that we're asking our grid to perform through this transformation. AEP stands ready to engage in that dialogue. Now regarding the unregulated business. We continue to make progress to improve the value proposition of the business by focusing on cost containment, investment decisions reflecting market signals, pushing for capacity market design changes and working at the state level with PPA approaches. Additionally, we continue to work with our board regarding the available options to further shareholder value and define milestones and objectives regarding varying issues associated with this business. And we'll work -- continue to do that work in 2015. AEP will continue in defining itself as a regulated utility by providing consistent and quality dividends and earnings potential. Any decision and the timing of those decisions will be dictated by that focus. Now I'll turn it over to Brian. Brian X. Tierney: Thank you, Nick, and good morning, everyone. On Slide 5. You will see our comparison of 2014 results to 2013 by segment for both the quarter and the year-to-date periods. As I did in July, I will focus my remarks primarily in the quarterly results. You can find the details for the year-to-date comparison in the appendix. Operating earnings for the third quarter were $493 million or $1.01 per share compared to the $1.10 per share or $533 million recorded last year. These results, when combined with the results through June, pushed our year-to-date earnings to $1.4 billion or $2.95 per share compared to $2.63 per share or $1.3 billion earned in 2013. Our year-to-date results remain strong compared to last year driven by weather-related sales combined with strong operations during this past winter. The third quarter dampened these results somewhat due to mild weather and increased O&M as a result of shifting in timing. On the positive side, we continue to see growth in earnings through rate changes and our Transmission Holdco segment where we expect to meet or exceed our original guidance of $0.29 per share by year end. With that as an overview, let me step you through the major earnings drivers by segment for the quarter on Slide 6. Third quarter earnings for the Vertically Integrated Utilities segment were $0.45 per share, down $0.11 from last year's results. Weather adversely affected the quarterly comparison by $0.05 per share due to mild temperatures across much of our service territory. O&M expense was higher than last year, which lowered the results for this segment by $0.10 per share. The higher O&M was due in part to improved incremental spending, including shifting costs from future years, primarily in our generation and wires functions. O&M was also impacted by an increase in employee-related costs and the effect of certain credits recorded in 2013. Depreciation expense was higher year-over-year due to increased capital investment. This lowered earnings by $0.03 per share. Positive comparisons to last year include rate changes, which added $0.02 for the quarter. This increase in rates is related to incremental investment to serve our customers. Normalized retail margins contributed $0.01 per share to the year-over-year growth, driven by increased sales in the industrial class, primarily offset by lower sales to the residential class. I will talk more about the loading economy in a few minutes. Despite lower wholesale power prices, off-system sales margin for this segment improved by $0.02 per share. Solid plant operations and lower margin sharing contributed to this result. Other items in total added $0.02 to the earnings for the quarter including lower interest expense and higher AFUDC. The Transmission & Distribution Utilities segment earned $0.19 per share for the quarter, $0.06 below 2013 results. Regulatory reserves adversely affected the quarterly comparison by $0.04 per share. A decline in normalized load and higher depreciation expense each impacted the quarterly comparison by $0.01 per share. In addition, other items in total were off $0.02 per share. On the positive side, rate changes related to new distribution investment in Ohio drove a favorable comparison of $0.02 per share. The Transmission Holdco segment continues to grow contributing $0.09 per share for the quarter, a $0.05 improvement, reflecting our continued significant capital spending in this area. In the past 12 months, the segment's net plant grew by approximately $1.1 billion, an increase of 83%. The Generation & Marketing segment produced solid earnings of $0.24 per share, adding $0.01 to the quarterly comparison. An improvement in gross margins due to lower fuel costs and favorable hedging was partially offset by higher maintenance expenses. AEP River Operations contributed $0.02 per share more than the 2013 results due to improved barge freight demand. In summary, despite the effects of mild weather on the quarter, we were still able to shift costs out of future years, and we remain well positioned within the revised guidance range of $3.40 to $3.50 per share. Let's take a look at Slide 7, where we can review normalized load trends for the quarter. Similar to last quarter, when I made comments about industrial and total load on this slide, my remarks will adjust for the impact of the Ormet load. As you may recall, Ormet, our largest industrial customer at the time, ceased operations in the fourth quarter of 2013. By adjusting for Ormet, you get a sense of how our industrial and total load is recovering in more of a going-forward basis since Ormet is not expected to return to production. In the charts, the numbers are presented with and without the effects of Ormet. On the bottom right of the slide, you can see that overall, weather-normalized load was up 1.1%. This is being driven by industrial load, which was up 4.8%. This marks the fourth consecutive quarter with positive growth in industrial sales. The company experienced growth in 8 of our top 10 sectors for the quarter and 9 of our top 10 for the year. The lone exception for the year is the mining, excluding oil and gas sector, which was down 3%. The quarterly sector leaders are Pipeline Transportation, up 33%; Oil and Gas Extraction, up 11%; Primary Metals, our largest sector, was up 9% for the quarter; and Chemical Manufacturing, our second-largest sector, was up 6%. We will talk more about the shale gas impacts on the economy of AEP service territory later. On the upper right of the slide, you can see that commercial sales were up 0.002% for the quarter and have experienced positive growth for the last 5 quarters. We feel confident that we will notch a positive annual comparison for the year for the first time since 2008. 5 of our 7 operating companies have experienced normalized commercial sales increases of 1% or greater through the first 9 months of the year, and we continue to see growth in the number of the commercial customers. Finally, in the upper left of the slide, you can see that residential sales were down 1.1% for the quarter. Even though residential sales have been down over the past 2 quarters, they are up year-to-date and are expected to be positive for the year. Turning to Slide 8. Let's review the recent economic for AEP service territory. Looking at estimated GDP growth for the quarter with recent updates, the economy for the U.S. is now growing faster than AEP's territory at 2.3% and 1.7%, respectively. On the upper-right side of the slide, you can see that economic growth in our western footprint continues to outpace the U.S. and our eastern service area, which trails U.S. growth by 0.006%. In the bottom-left quadrant, you can see that positive job growth in AEP service area trails that of the U.S. as a whole by 0.004%. Similar to GDP, job growth in AEP's western territories outpaces both the U.S. and AEP's eastern service areas. For AEP, we have experienced strong employment gains in the following sectors : natural resources and mining, construction, leisure and hospitality and manufacturing. With that segue, let's turn to Slide 9 to see how the U.S. shale gas developments impact AEP's industrial growth. As we've mentioned previously, we are seeing significant industrial load increases in the parts of our service territory that are located in major shale formations. AEP is fortunate to serve at least parts of 5 of the major 7 shale plays in the U.S., which according to the EIA account for over 95% of growth in domestic oil production and 100% of the growth in domestic natural gas production since 2011. For the quarter, industrial shales in the shale counties were up 28% compared to the 1% increase in nonshale counties. Over the past 4 years, we've seen an average increase of 31% over the prior year in our shale counties. This shale region growth is significant for AEP because 17% of our industrial sales are located in shale gas counties. The bottom chart shows industrial sales growth by major shale region. In our Eastern footprint, industrial sales are growing fastest in the Utica and Marcellus regions. In our Western footprint, we are growing fastest in the Permian and Woodford regions, while sales are down slightly in the Eagle Ford areas. Turning to Slide 10. Let's review the financial health of the company. Our debt-to-total capital has continued to improve and now stands at 53.4%. Our credit metrics, FFO interest coverage and FFO to debt remain solidly in the BBB and Baa1 range at 4.9x and 18.5%, respectively. Our qualified pension funding decreased 1% from last quarter and now stands at 99% funded. During the quarter, a modest decrease in plan liabilities from slightly higher interest rates was more than offset by plan asset declines. Finally, our liquidity stands at about $3 billion and is supported by our 2 revolving credit facilities that extend into the summers of 2016 and 2017. We are currently looking for opportunities to extend these tenors. We've worked hard over the last several years to achieve the financial strength demonstrated on this slide and believe we are well positioned for the future. Finally, turning to Slide 11. Let me preview some of the detail that we expect -- that we will be sharing with you at the EEI Fall Conference in a few weeks. Last year, we provide detail supporting the company's 4% to 6% operating earnings growth rate off of original 2013 guidance. This year, we will show you how we have been executing on our plan and delivering results that keep us in the ranges we provided you. You should expect an update about investment and growth opportunities available to our Transcos and transmission JVs as well as our regulated wires and integrated utilities companies. We will provide you with an update on the continuous improvement and lean initiatives that we outlined last year. You will recall that O&M discipline was a crucial component of filling the earnings gap presented by declining capacity revenues over the next few years. We will provide updates on our progress on these initiatives. Last year at EEI, we provided a lot of information designed to offer insight, transparency and credibility to our investment and 4% to 6% growth goals. We plan to update you on those details this year. At this time, we do not have any plans to make strategic announcements at the fall EEI Conference. With that, I will turn the call over to the operator for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And first on the line, we have Dan Eggers from Credit Suisse. Daniel L. Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Can we just talk a little bit more about kind of where O&M stands? Obviously, you've been able to monetize the good first quarter this year, but when you look at the plan and kind of the more lackluster weather this summer, how much O&M do you guys expect to pull forward from '15 and '16 into '14? And how should we think about that affecting kind of '15 and '16 inflation off the '14 numbers? Nicholas K. Akins: You saw our original plan is -- still is our plan, to move the $60 million that we discussed earlier into '14. So that was pretty much the extent of what we were capable of moving in from those years. Brian X. Tierney: And Dan, we've completed about 30 of that so far year-to-date, with most of that 30 being in the third quarter. And we anticipate about another 30 in the fourth quarter of this year. Daniel L. Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Okay. And then on the load growth conversation, you obviously -- the weather-normalized numbers as you show them the slides look pretty good, but the first quarter number still feels a little flaky, shall we say. What do you guys expect for kind of normalized load growth at this point in time? And what do you see swinging that as far as the industrial staying durable, I suppose? Nicholas K. Akins: Brian? Brian X. Tierney: Yes, so Dan, we anticipate being the end of the year at about 7% -- 0.007% including Ormet and almost 2% if you exclude Ormet for the balance of the year. The thing that you'll notice in the quarterly results, and it's likely to be true in the next few years as well, is a preponderance of that growth is being felt in the industrial side. So when we traditionally think about load growth, we're thinking about it sort of more evenly spread across residential, commercial and industrial and recognizing we make more margin in the residential and commercial side than we do industrial. So while we're pleased in the growth that we're seeing, it's not in the part of the business that is higher margin for us, and we have that forecast going forward in '15 and '16 as well. Nicholas K. Akins: As a general rule, we -- I guess post-2008, we saw industrials come off, but the financials still held in there because the residential and commercials were late coming off as a result. So as the industrials were consistently going offline, I think it was like 17% reduction post-2008, and then -- but we were able to hold those financials. So now the reverse is sort of happening, where it's great that we're seeing the industrial increases that we're seeing on a consistent basis. But it's going to take time for the residential, and particularly the residential to catch up, because they need sustainability of industrial and commercial load growth for people to actually start relocating and moving out of the house and for the 20-year-olds and that kind of thing. So that's what we're looking for. So that -- it's good that we see the consistency. But, obviously, it's going to be a slow process. Daniel L. Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : I have just one last one, just on the Ohio generation conversation. Obviously, you have this request for late spring next year, but what markers should we be watching from the outside as far as when you think decision points could come up on the interim as to whether you're able to get a PPA done and maybe the sensitivities to what you're willing to do or not do in the negotiation process? Nicholas K. Akins: Yes. So there's sort of 3 markers there, but I'm not sure how each marker plays into the decision process because the first marker is clearly important. And that is the current ESP filing, the ESP 3 filing that contains the PPA for the OVEC generation, if the commission rejects that, then that's probably a pretty clear indication that the PPA process is pretty much going nowhere. But if they approve that, then there's the potential for subsequent approvals relative to FirstEnergy's request and then ultimately to our request. So that first milestone is critical. And then as we move forward into next year, and I think all of this is going to happen after the governor's election, we'll probably see before the end of the year our ESP 3 case. Hopefully, it will be resolved by the commission. And then subsequent to that, the other 2, including the FirstEnergy request, but our request as well, on the additional generation. So I think it's clearly important. It's important to the industrials, certain industrials. And it's also important from the stability of these resources that are located in Ohio. Right now, Ohio is short capacity, and it's just amazing to me that Ohio would be moving a policy direction that enables generation to be built out of state for import back into the state, particularly with the Utica Shale gas development. But this is where the policy decisions are made with the Ohio Commission. And we need to hear what the thought process is, and we're ready to go based upon whatever that outcome is. Operator : Our next question is from Anthony Crowdell with Jefferies. Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : Two quick questions, one related to Ohio. And I believe with the OVEC filing, I thought the commission had to come up with a decision in, I believe, it was like 270 days. And I know, I think you've exceeded that. Have there been any filings on when a decision is coming out or maybe somebody saying it's past due? And the second question is related to FERC ROEs. And previously, you guys had a -- in one of your chart books, you showed how your ROE was kind of in the middle of the range. And with this downward pressure we've seen in transmission ROEs, does that push you guys more on the higher end and there's a risk that there's going to be downward pressure on your FERC ROE? Nicholas K. Akins: Okay, so first the Ohio issue. Yes, they're beyond the 270 days. But usually, we don't send past-due notices to the commission. So it's one of those things where I think the commission is going to have to thoughtfully go through this process. And it's a major, I mean, it's a major decision for them relative to the PPA approach. And I'm certainly hopeful that they're thoughtfully considering it and making sure that any order stands up to any type of legal type of challenge. We certainly believe it's legal. And in our filings, we certainly presented a case to that effect. And let's hope they do the right thing. As far as the transmission ROEs, yes, there is downward pressure on transmission ROEs, but they haven't affected us. We certainly have our projects and our TransCo ROEs that are in place. So from an overall sense, we're well within the bandwidth of reasonableness. So from our perspective, we're still in great shape. And I think even in the future, FERC seems to be really careful about ensuring that we continue to encourage transmission investment. And I would expect those ROEs to still encourage that and be the preferable place to put -- for us to put our money. Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : Just quickly a follow-up on Ohio. Do you think the delay -- obviously, you're not going to send a past-due notice. But do you think part of the delay maybe that you're waiting for a decision for the OVEC plan, but then you filed for the incremental plans? Is that causing some of the delay, you think? Or it's just really -- everyone seems really quiet in Ohio with the governor's election. Is it maybe related to that? Nicholas K. Akins: Yes. I think it's probably the latter of what you said. Because it is separate. It's a separate issue. But the commission has had our ESP filing for a while now. But I think for -- there's a lot of activity obviously around governor's elections in the state -- in any state. And this is a policy decision that needs to be made in a calm environment. And as we look forward to the policy decisions here, it's important for, certainly, the aspect of maintaining generation. But also it raises the question of what does the future mean for Ohio in terms of the building of new capacity within the state. And that probably -- the PPA is somewhat of a Band-Aid approach to maintaining existing generation. But you still have further issues to define within Ohio because clearly they were depending upon the PJM market construct to provide for that -- for capacity to be built, but that's not happening. So there'll be continued evolution of policymaking in Ohio relative to the energy picture. Operator : Our next question is from Kit Konolige with BGC Partners. Kit Konolige - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division : Nick, in your discussion of the unregulated generation business, you discussed that you're, as you've said before, involved in assessing what the optimum approach is to enhance shareholder value. So I'm just wondering if a, you were saying anything different today with regards to timing when you talked about continuing to work in 2015? And b, how much the current proceedings on, at PJM regarding capacity performance and the DR issue and moving the demand curve, how much you want to see those completed or maybe the next auction completed before you go ahead and give us an idea of what you've decided to do with that segment? Nicholas K. Akins: Yes. So clearly, you're going to see some milestones here. Obviously, the Ohio PPA is one, and then the auction and what happens relative to that certainly will be another. But those are -- all those are particular areas that we're focusing on to enhance the value of our unregulated generation and provide the ability to continue for that business to be a bona fide operation in the future because clearly they need to be able to invest and maintain their facilities in the future. So it's sort of a no-regret strategy around maintaining and enhancing the value of that business. That, to me, is separate from the decision of what that -- what the disposition of that business is in the future. We still maintain that we're a regulated utility. We have to be able to take volatility out of the equation, particularly the capacity market volatility. And it has to be -- it has to look quasi-regulated. Now I don't think the time line of the decision process has changed at all. And we'll still be able to measure that business based upon the lack of volatility and the ability to invest in that business in the future and -- but clearly, we are looking for something that is either regulated, quasi-regulated. But at the end of the day, we will be a regulated utility. Kit Konolige - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division : So, I mean, not to press you too hard on this, but is there a way to describe what the timetable could be as you see it now on when you would have enough information about the policy environment to be able to determine whether it was close enough to a regulated that you'd want to retain it or make a decision whether to retain or to divest? Nicholas K. Akins: Yes. So the question that you started out with was relative to some of the milestones. And those near-term milestones are going to tell you a whole lot. But as far as actually getting into the decision, we are about focusing on infrastructure development, focusing on the development of transmission, focusing on certainly infrastructure that provides for improvement in the customer experience. And to the extent this particular business enables us to use it as a springboard to other focused areas that I just talked about, that's a positive thing. So we will determine the future of that business based upon not only the value it produces from a shareholder perspective but also what our other options are that we've described. So I don't think any -- nothing has changed relative to the process that we're going through. And, obviously, we're looking at the options relative to that business. And we'll continue to do that. 2015, I think in early 2015, particularly with the Ohio decision and the PJM capacity auction, will be particularly instructive. And I think it will probably be a fascinating 2015. Kit Konolige - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division : No doubt, okay. One other separate area. Can you give us a sense of how much -- let me put it this way, how much would the growth rate in load have to decrease before it impacted your earnings growth rate target? Nicholas K. Akins: Brian? Brian X. Tierney: Kit, when we put those out a year ago, in the years '14 to '16, overall load was in the negative 0.005% to positive 0.005% range. We're seeing ourselves now clearly above that in year-to-date, but the mix is very much different from what we talked about. So that was the range that we used last year, was the negative 0.005% to positive 0.005%. And we'll be providing an update to that more specifically at EEI in a couple of weeks. Kit Konolige - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division : So you're referring to the difference in margin that you get from industrial versus residential? Brian X. Tierney: Correct. Operator : Our next question's from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Just -- not to beat a dead horse here on the Ohio situation. But with respect to the independent market monitor, there's been some back and forth in the FirstEnergy case. And I noticed that they've intervened in your case. How should we think about the significance of that in terms of your case or how you feel about that? Nicholas K. Akins: Yes, I don't think it's completely unexpected. And I think that whenever -- there are going to be challenges based upon the process that we're going through. But the issue remains that SB 221 allows for the Ohio Commission to decide what resources are contained within a PPA approach. And it's very different than the obligation that was placed by legislation in places like Maryland and New Jersey. So a very different approach. And matter of fact -- I mean, you have multiple parties still participating with FRR. They can participate in the PJM market, but they still have regulated operating company requirements relative to generation resources. So it's difficult to make that argument that a FERC-regulated PPA is -- goes against a market construct. So certainly the independent monitor will have his opinion, and everyone else will have their opinions. But we believe we're doing the right thing. Operator : Next, we'll go to Steven Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC: Just, Nick, in your prepared remarks, you mentioned something about kind of hitting your growth rate, but also kind of dealing with growing pains. Could you just talk a little bit more about the growing pains, the regulatory lag and some of the things you mentioned there? Nicholas K. Akins: Yes. So overall, I'm just trying to make sure that people understand as we go through this process, we're moving -- we're trying to smooth out a huge hole that we had in 2016 and still provide consistent quality earnings and dividend growth for our investors through that period, regardless of what happens. And typically, when you do that -- and your questions like when you -- well, the Mitchell deal, for example. The Mitchell arrangement, the 17.5% that I talked about earlier, it'd have been great to get the whole thing transferred in and be able to recover all of that day 1. But for us, we felt like because we have ins and outs that are occurring throughout that entire cycle, we felt comfortable to go ahead and do that particular settlement, even though the larger benefits for us, and ultimately for the consumer as well, will be when we are able to transfer that other 17.5%, at least the financial side of that 17.5%, into a base rate. So it's those kinds of trade-offs that we're making all the time. And then as we do lean efficiency gains, we're also having to measure those types of things compared to what's going on in relative earnings tests in the various jurisdictions and those types of things. So we have to be -- it's sort of a -- we're pulling multiple levers through this entire process. And some things will go positive. Some things will go negative. But we're very comfortable with where we stand within the guidance range that we've given. And I think we're solidly within that guidance range going forward. So that's the point that I was making. I think there's -- we just don't want to have a lot of irrational exuberance that says that we're adding all the positives and not considering the negatives. This is our job, and this is what we do. And -- but we're very happy with where our guidance range is right now. Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC: Okay, great. Second question is just on the dividend increase you guys announced earlier this week, the 6%. Nicholas K. Akins: Yes. Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC: Could you maybe just give us a little sense on context that within your dividend policy? It is at the high end of your earnings growth range. Is that -- how should we just think about that, the overall dividend policy? Nicholas K. Akins: Yes. So, Steve, we had a 60% to 70% range that certainly we have espoused earlier for a couple of years now. And the board certainly is committed to that. And we felt like it was time to make a move that not only demonstrated our confidence in the business and the formulation and the guidance that we've given through the period, but also to make sure that we stayed within that 60% to 70%. And I think that it was important for us to make that move. And the context of it was centered around where we see the earnings in the future and where we see this business case developing. And the board felt confident about that approach. Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC: Okay. And then just lastly, just how are you feeling about reliability next summer with all the plant shutdowns in your Eastern region? Obviously, a lot of those are your plants. Just how do you feel about reliability? Nicholas K. Akins: Yes. So -- this is probably a sore subject for me because as we look at the retirements that are occurring in 2015, if we do have a hard, hot summer or even worse, a cold winter in '15, we're going to have serious issues. And I think that -- I think it's going to be a challenge from a reliability perspective. So, hopefully, we'll have a milder summer and a milder winter, but I still believe there's 2 functions here. One is will the system actually operate the way it was intended to operate? And I think it's going to be on the ragged edge of its ability to do that. And then secondly, financially, what will it mean to customers? Because there will be shortages. There will be prices that -- already the Northeast is concerned about deliverability of natural gas because a lot like a pipeline capability, well, the same is true for the electric grid. And there will be areas where prices will be much higher than people anticipated. So I -- the more you take out of this grid, particularly on base load generation that provides 24/7 support, the more volatile it becomes both operationally and financially. Now I can sit here and say, as a company, from a financial perspective, as long as we operate with excellence, which is what we did during the last polar vortex, we'll be fine financially. But part of our role too is to think about our customers. And while I'm certainly sensitive to 2015 and concerned about 2015, we won't know until we get there. Operator : Our next question is from Mike Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : This may be a Brian question. Brian, you were talking about demand and how industrial demand is really what's driving the year-over-year growth and that the margins on industrial are obviously less than res or commercial. Can you quantify that for us? Like you've given 3-year guidance, roughly on a EPS basis, what's the sensitivity to every 1% change in demand for each of the customer classes? Brian X. Tierney: I don't have that for you, Michael. We'll be able to have that at the EEI Conference. But I think a 0.5% overall evenly distributed was a $0.05 move EPS annually. Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Okay. And so kind of back of the envelope, if that 0.5% is being driven largely by industrial, you'd kind of think that -- that assumes it's -- the 0.5% is evenly distributed, but what you're seeing isn't necessarily that? Brian X. Tierney: That's the point we're making. Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Okay. One other question, balance sheet. Balance sheet has gotten much healthier, congrats on that, over the last couple of years. When you look forward, do you see a time in the next 2 to 3 years where your balance sheet, kind of heaven forbid, is even too healthy? And how do you define what your long-term goal is for the balance sheet? Brian X. Tierney: Yes. So Michael, we've been getting some of those questions. And I think the idea is what do we do with that balance sheet capacity. And I think you've seen as we have increasingly shifted our spend to the wires side of the business. So you saw before we started 2014, something like 69% of the spend, '14 to '16, was going to wires pieces of our business and increasingly more of that to the transmission side where we had the lowered regulatory lag and the higher ROE. So if you look for us to consume some of that balance sheet capacity that you talked about, I'm inclined to think that you would see that trend continuing. As Lisa and her side of the business in transmission seems to have an insatiable appetite for capital that can return that 11.49% to 11.2% ROE range with very, very little lag. So that's part of the challenge that the management team is working on, is how do we grow the company in the ranges that we've talked about? How do we overcome some of the revenue gaps that Nick talked about associated with capacity? And in addition to growth, how do we continue to reward our shareholders in the form of a dividend? And we need to make sure that we balance all of those shareholder interests equally, and that's what we're struggling with. And that's what we'll provide what I hope are positive updates for investors at the EEI Conference. Nicholas K. Akins: I think it's an important question, too. We get a lot from an M&A perspective and everything like that. And while obviously the patent answer to any M&A question is we can't talk about it. But we can talk about the way we think about investments and the use of our balance sheet. And, actually, we just look at it as uses and sources. And one source is our healthy balance sheet to be able to invest more in our business. But probably the more important question is what are you investing in? And we want to make absolutely sure that we're investing in those types of investments that will produce the quality returns, the continuity and consistency and the concurrence of a recovery of investment that things like transmission provide. And that's our measure, that's our -- that's our measuring stick. And that's the litmus test for how we invest. So we're well aware of where our balance sheet stands, but we're always looking at credible options for -- to enhance shareholder value. Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : I guess, one last one. We've seen this in the wireline telecom business this year. There's been a little discussion in the power and utility business as well. Everybody loves to ask the question about what are going to do with the generation business. And I want to ask a little bit of that same question, but really for the transmission business, a high-growth business, high-return business, in terms of do you think that's adequately reflected in the share price? And -- or do you think there are alternative corporate structures that may enable investors to kind of price that in correctly? And how do you go about the process of looking at that? Nicholas K. Akins: I would say it this way, and Brian can certainly add on to this. But you look at REITs or yield cos and all those types of structures, and there's rewards associated with each one of them, particularly in a business that is central to AEP, and certainly one that we continue to invest in. So I think -- I'd rather see AEP emerge as trading more like a fully regulated and transmission-oriented utility. And that to me is where we're at in the process at this point. Brian X. Tierney: Michael, we've gotten those questions before, and instead of just saying, \"Oh, we're not going to look at those things,\" we've looked very hard at them with our advisers and tax experts and the like and have come up with the concept that from a REIT standpoint, in particular, we took a really hard look at. A lot of what we've done on the Transco formation is get those Transcos approved at each of the utilities where we operate. And because the REIT would own the transmission assets, we would have to go about and get them certified at each of the states where we do business because they'd be utility asset owners. And then to take advantage of the tax implications of the REIT, we would have to sell a portion of that REIT off. We'd have to spin it because we wouldn't get the tax advantage under a parent environment. And then we'd have to likely come up with some split by which we would share those tax benefits. So the complexities are pretty immense. And we'd want to make sure that the benefits are sustainable and that proposed tax law changes and the like wouldn't make all that hard work and complexity that we'd go to transitory and fleeting. So in the meantime, the REIT is something we've looked very hard at, and it doesn't work for us. And then on a yield co, the size and scale of where we're at doesn't work now as well. So there are structures that we'll continue to look at and look at them hard. But to date, we've found that, as Nick said, keeping those businesses under an AEP umbrella are very beneficial to our shareholders. Nicholas K. Akins: Michael, I think you can probably appreciate this and some others on the call that we remain focused on answering this unregulated generation question. So that is something that we're focused on at this point. And as far as the timing of transmission, we can continue to invest in transmission, notwithstanding these other structural components. But the clear issue for us is to get on with this unregulated generation decision. Operator : That'll be from Greg Gordon with ISI Group. Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division : So perhaps you won't answer this, Brian. But you talked about the growth rate, 4% to 6%. You've obviously been asked about that ad nauseam a bunch of different ways. You're going to give us an update at EEI. But when you gave that, initially you said it was based off a midpoint of $3.05 to $3.25 for '13, which you then -- you gave a guidance range for '14 of $3.20 to $3.40. You updated that to $3.35 to $3.55 after the first quarter. Now you're at $3.40 to $3.50. 2013 seems to me quite a stale base year to be basing a growth rate off of. Should we assume that you're going to give us an update on the growth rate off of '14, or perhaps '15, on what you've earned as a base year? Or how should we think about that? Brian X. Tierney: So I agree with you, Greg. I think looking back to original guidance for 2013 is getting pretty stale here towards the end of 2014. So we are going to update how we look going forward, what the growth rate looks like. I'm inclined to think we're not going to add another year of specific earnings guidance at the end. We've gone 2014, '15, '16. I don't think we're going to show specific guidance, '17, '18. But we are going to talk about the growth rate at EEI. Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division : So it sounds like the gross rate isn't going to change demonstrably, but the base year will be refreshed? Brian X. Tierney: We just need to -- I mean, I don't want to be here in 2015 talking about original guidance for 2013. So we need to get off that and start talking about more what we look like going forward. And we'll be able to do that in a credible way at EEI. Bette Jo Rozsa : Okay. Thank you for joining us on today's call.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Ms. Bette Jo Rozsa. Please go ahead. Bette Jo Rozsa : Thank you, Keeley. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the fourth quarter 2014 earnings webcast of American Electric Power. We're glad that you are able to join us today. Our earnings release, presentation slides, and related financial information are available on our Web site at aep.com. Today, we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors. Joining me this morning for opening remarks are Nick Akins, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Tierney, our Chief Financial Officer. We will take your questions following their remarks. I will now turn the call over to Nick. Nick Akins : Thanks, Bette Jo. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our fourth quarter 2014 earnings call. 2014 was an outstanding year for AEP, not just because our earnings came in within the stated guidance range close to the midpoint, which that is great, but the real story is how we did it. Our management team and employees pulled together a set of firm foundation for the future, the culture that allows for the proper and timely allocation of capital, the ability to take advantage of additional spending opportunities brought on by our first quarter performance, and our focus on disciple and execution by our employees to produce continuous improvement savings to provide the consistency our shareholders and customers expect. As you probably know by now, Columbus is pretty excited by the Ohio State University football team winning the National Championship this year. They won it because of process, execution, discipline, and leadership that transcended the many pitfalls along the way. AEP is no different in our quest to become a premium regulated utility. From the outset in 2014, our generation performance during the polar vortex offered an opportunity to advance investment in transmission, detail plans for the movement of O&M expense in the 2014 from 2015 and '16, and build upon the foundation of our continuous improvement initiatives. My point being all of these processes already exist to enable AEP to have the ability to quickly respond with confidence to ultimately improve shareholder value as well as produce value for our customers. So with that said, reviewing the financials for the quarter and the year, our GAAP and operating earnings for the fourth quarter were $0.39 per share and $0.48 per share respectively. Our fourth quarter performance was as we expected, given the headwinds of advanced spending, resolution of coal contract issues, and the placement of certain regulatory reserves. The only surprise really was the recent Kentucky decision that knocked us down about $0.05 per share for 2014, which I'll discuss later. Even after these adjustments, our earnings were $3.34 per share on a GAAP basis, and $3.43 per share on an operating basis for 2014, still within the operating earnings guidance range of $3.40 to $3.50 per share. We also increased the dividend 6% on an annualized basis, producing a total shareholder return of 35.1% for the year. As you can see, total shareholder return over the one, three, and five year cycles had been impressive. Okay, that's great, but now what about 2015? AEP is reaffirming our guidance range of $3.40 to $3.60 per share for 2015, with a 4% to 6% earnings growth rate based upon our original 2014 guidance that we shared at the November EEI financial conference. AEP will continue to focus on growth of the regulated businesses, in particular our transmission business focused on effective capital allocation and O&M discipline, and our continuous improvement process redesigned through lean initiatives. Through our operating company model, constructive regulatory outcomes will be critical through our success, especially in West Virginia and Kentucky, both with major rate case activities this year. Other major areas impacting AEP during 2015 include economic growth in our territory, PJM capacity market reform, the Ohio PPA proposals, the strategic review of our unregulated generation business, and the EPA Clean Power Plant final rule. So I'll quickly go over some of these issues before moving on to the regulatory matters impacting the equalizer graph on the next page. First, the economy in the AEP territory continues to show a rebound with significant and balanced growth in all three major customer classes. Overall, normalized load for the fourth quarter of 2014 increased 3.1% over fourth quarter 2013, excluding Ormet showing solid growth in almost all sectors of the economy. This is great news moving into the new year. Brian will share more specifics regarding load in a few minutes. We are making excellent progress regarding our continuous improvement initiatives with business functional reviews on schedule, while achieving the targeted savings. Lean deployment is complete in 13 distribution districts, with another 13 districts review planned for 2015, bringing the total to 26 of the 32 districts. We hope to move the others planned for 2016 into 2015, so that we can achieve the full value of these deployments in 2016. We have also completed initial deployment activities at the nuclear, IT, supply chain, commercial operations, customer and distribution services among others. We have also now completed 10 fossil plants with two others planned to complete during 2015. Transmission has completed the first of five, and the others have also planned to be completed in 2015, so another big year for lean deployment in these and other areas. We're also following up with lean maturity assessment in all of the completed areas starting in 2015 to ensure sustainability of these efforts. Capacity market reform continues in PJM with filings of proposals for the capacity performance model and supplemental options with FERC. While some changes to these proposals are necessary to improve longer term financial stability as we discussed in our filing in these matters, we are pleased that PJM is pursuing these necessary and important changes. They will improve the balance approach to resources, in particular, ensuring the financial viability and value of base load generating facilities that provide substantial electric system reliability and support. We're hopeful that FERC will recognize the importance of these reforms to not only stabilize the PJM markets, but also ensure the reliability of the PJM footprint, particularly in the face of impending coal unit retirements in 2015 and beyond. FERC needs to approve these changes expeditiously, so that adjustments could be made to the upcoming PJM capacity options. Regarding the status of the Ohio purchase power agreement, PPA, pending decisions, we believe that the December special hearing that we held before the PUCO, a strong case was made by AEP and other parties that a legal basis and path exists under Ohio and Federal Law that allows PPAs to be put in place to not only protect customers from volatile capacity and energy markets, but also protect Ohio generation jobs and taxes. The first shoe [ph] will drop soon with our ESP III case that contains the PPA approach for the OVEC generation capacity followed at some point by the remaining PPAs for the approximately 2700 megawatts of capacity that is most at risk in Ohio. These decisions are critical to the viability of these generating assets, and to Ohio's energy future. The choice is clear for the PUCO, either generation to be maintained in the State as a hedge for customers against significant price swings with the added value of jobs and taxes, tax benefits to Ohio or we can continue to be an importer of power from out-of-state with further negative impacts on Utica shale development and economic development within the State. A positive decision on the ESP III case would at least open the door for a healthy continued dialog regarding the future of Ohio resources. The EPA's clean power plant continues to gain attention with over 2 million comments filed. AEP filed comments with the EPA not only defining the legal impediments to EPA's tortured position regarding the rules development, but we as well as many other knowledgeable parties made the case that the timing of the 2020 interim target are not achievable, and the reliability and resiliency of the electric grid is at risk if U.S. EPA continues to pursue this much too aggressive path and transform our nation's capacity in energy supply. Without adequate time available for states and those responsible for liability to perform the proper studies before implementation can even begin, we risk a more costly and chaotic path to a cleaner energy economy. We're pleased that the FERC, NERC and as well as the congress are focused on the reliability issue, and we look forward to participating in FERC's technical conferences that are upcoming this year. Additional warnings have been issued by several of the regional transmission operators, and many of our states are extremely concerned about these proposed rules, and so are we. Now, regarding the unregulated businesses, as you are all aware, ideal.com article mentioned that we had engaged an investment bank to help us evaluate our alternatives related to the disposition of that business. We acknowledge we had indeed hired the bank as a part of the process we have been discussing with you all for several quarters. As we discussed previously, we are engaged with our Board and are evaluating the strategic alternatives as certain milestones of factual information become known, such as timing for capacity market reforms and auctions, Ohio PPA guidance, and of course the impact of retirement on capacity energy markets. All of these issues represent no regrets actions to enhance generation of value, regardless of the ultimate decision regarding these assets. This analysis continues and remains on track. So now, moving to the equalizer graph which is the page five of the presentation; obviously strong regulated results, we continue to do several things. First of all, we presented in a different way this time, showed 2014 earned regulate ROEs, and then also showed a pro forma view of 2015. That was done because primarily the ROEs are lower on the left hand side of the page for 2014 because of the advanced spending that occurred, and also does not reflect the revenue that was generated from the unregulated generation side that we used those proceeds to actually do the advanced spending of those -- in those various jurisdictions. So, as I go through each one of those, for Ohio power, we'll continue to expect to see Ohio power to earn 12% in 2015 in line with the ROE authorized in the most recent seat analysis. As far as APCo is concerned, as I said last quarter, the combined company amassed a disparity between Virginia and West Virginia ROEs. We're doing fine in Virginia, but as far as West Virginia is concerned, we have a lot of work to do there. There is a case that's been filed for 226 million of which 45 million relates to a vegetation management writer. The earned ROE for West Virginia was approximately 5.8% as filed in the rate case. So hearing has just concluded last week, and we expect an order on that rate case in late May. As far as Kentucky is concerned, Kentucky has 5.1%. It certainly reflects the supplies we got relative to the order from Kentucky. We had to take a $36 million regulatory provision that was recorded because of the fuel costs disallowance that occurred as it related to Mitchell. We've also filed a rate case at the end of 2014 that reflects about 70 million increase for the full recovery of Mitchell, and we expect that case to be effective in July 2015. So it was vicarious to us that we line up with a single issue rate making approach associated with the fuel costs issues, and not taking account the broader issues that also will be involved in the rate case. So we're disappointed with that outcome, and certainly there's precedence there that we were banking on in terms of minimum load commitments and those types of things, but we're considering an appeal of that order, but also want to stay engaged with the Kentucky Commission so that we fully understand where they're going and what we need to do to bring about a more positive environment in Kentucky. So moving on to I&M I&M is doing very well, 7.9% because of the additional spending that's occurring there, the O&M shifts from the future years. And I&M is well positioned to grow earnings and achieve a 10% ROE. I&M has a great regulatory framework and a lot of major capital investment programs that are in place, and we expect that to continue to improve, and that's why the pro forma side relative to I&M is up towards 10.8%. PSO continues with fourth quarter 2014 earnings improved over the prior year resulting in an ROE increase of 8.3% to 8.9% for those periods, and really it's because of O&M shifting and how our capital invested on the environmental spend associated with Northeastern units. So we're seeing some pressure there, but PSO is doing fine considering the advanced O&M spending. As far as SWEPCO is concerned, that issue remains in terms of Turk Arkansas portion of the generation. We're evaluating net debts in regard to that particular aspect of it, but nevertheless SWEPCO has been able to achieve a $14.4 million rate increase in Texas to recover transmission costs and the LPSC also improved -- the Louisiana Public Service Commission approved new rates that will go into effect -- did go into effect first of the year resulting additional 15 million of revenue. So SWEPCO obviously is working where it can, but the larger issue for SWEPCO will be the Turk portion of the generation, which we are developing plans associated with that. As far as AEP Texas is concerned, AEP Texas, the pro forma returned is coming down primarily because of a significant drop in increased CapEx, lower earnings, and the need to infuse equity associated with the securitization. So -- but they're filing a T-cost filing that was made in December with an approval expected in February 2015, and then also looking at the distribution filing as well. So, work in progress relative to AEP Texas. The Transco continues to do well. Those returns are still at the 11.5%, and look back at 11.2% for 2015. We continue to add additional plant and service, 837 million. The plant and service were added in 2014; and for ETT and other, 54 million of plant and service. So we continue to invest heavily in the transmission business, and those returns are what we expected. So overall the returns for the pro forma adjusted ROE is at 9.6% for 2015, which is slightly above I think, we had 9.5% in the EEI financial case. So it's slightly above that. But as you see the advanced spending of '15 and '16 roll off and as well the additional rate case activity that's occurring, we should see improvement during 2015. So, obviously I think it's been a great year because of the way we positioned the business, and as I said earlier, last quarter 2015 will be an interesting year, but one that no doubt why we're excited about and will set the tone for redefining AEP's future. So, now over to Brian. Brian Tierney : Thank you, Nick, and good morning everyone. On Slide 6 you will see our comparison of 2014 operating results to 2013 by segment, for both the quarter and the year-to-date period. I'll focus my remarks primarily on the total year results. You can find the details for the quarterly results in the appendix. Operating earnings for the fourth quarter were $232 million or $0.48 per share compared to $0.60 per share or $296 million last year. These results when combined with the results through September pushed our year-to-date operating earnings to $1.7 billion or $3.43 per share compared to $3.23 per share or $1.6 billion in 2013. Despite mild temperatures during this past summer, our 2014 results were strong compared to last year, driven by the weather-related sales and strong operations last winter. Our execution during this extreme periods produced sufficient margin for us to advance O&M spending from future years as well as to raise our 2014 midpoint target by $0.15 per share. Finally, we continue to deliver on our transmission targets, as Nick said, exceeding our 2014 forecast for the Transmission Holdco segment by $0.02 per share. With that as an overview, let me step you through the major earnings drivers by segments for the year on Slide 7. 2014 earnings for the vertically integrated utility segment were $1.45 per share down $0.07 from last year. The major drivers for this segment include the favorable effects of rate changes and strong off-system sales margins offset by higher non-fuel operating costs. Rate changes were recognized across many of our jurisdictions, adding $0.20 per share for the year. This favorable effect on earnings is related to incremental investment to serve our customers. Partially offsetting this result were regulatory provisions of $0.04 per share in APCo Virginia and $0.05 per share for the Kentucky fuel order. Increases in off-system sales benefited shareholders and customers. The higher margins improved earnings for this segment by $0.16 per share, while customers across several of our jurisdictions realized a $129 million through margin sharing mechanisms. This was driven by strong performance during last winter's polar vortex. O&M expense was higher than last year which lowered results for the segment by $0.28 per share. The higher O&M was due in part to plan incremental spending including shipping work in future years primarily in our generation wires functions. In addition, O&M was impacted by an increase in employee-related costs and the effects of certain credits recorded in 2013. Depreciation expense is also higher due to increased capital investment. This increased expense lowered earnings by $0.09 per share. To a lesser degree, weather and normalized load favorably affected the comparison by $0.02 and $0.01 per share respectively. Colder than normal temperatures were experienced most of this year, benefiting sales at the beginning and end of the year, but adversely affecting sales during the summer months. The transmission and distribution utility segments earned $0.72 per share for the year, $0.01 below 2013 results. The major drivers for this segment include the favorable effects of third-party transmission revenue and normalized load growth offset by higher operating costs. Higher third-party transmission revenues added $0.09 per share, resulting from increased transmission investments, increased revenues from customers who have switched to alternative suppliers in Ohio, and favorable rate adjustments in the PJM and ERCOT regions. Normalized load was strong in both Texas and Ohio, improving results by $0.06 per share. I'll talk more about Load and economy in a few minutes. Similar to the vertically integrated segments, O&M expense was higher than last year. This lowered the results for this segment by $0.05 per share. The higher expense was due in part to planned incremental spending, including shifting work from future years. In addition, O&M was impacted by an increase in employee-related costs. Depreciation expense was higher for the year due to increased capital investment lowering earnings by $0.04 per share. Certain tax items adversely affected the annual comparison by $0.04 per share due to higher property, State, and Federal income taxes. Rate changes and regulatory provisions netted together were unfavorably by $0.01 per share in the annual comparison. Finally, other items affected the comparison by $0.02 per share. The Transmission Holdco segment continues to grow, contributing $0.31 per share for the year, an improvement of $0.15, reflecting our continued significant investment in this area. In the past 12 months, this segment's plan grew by approximately $1.1 billion, an increase of 68%. The generation and marketing segment produced earnings of $0.84 per share adding $0.14 per share to the annual comparison. Gross margin improved more significantly early in the year due to the strong performance of the generation fleet and commercial organization during the polar vortex. The results in 2014 also benefited from lower fuel costs, partially offset by higher O&M expenses. These included maintenance costs as well as severance and retirement obligations related to unit retirements in 2015. AEP river operations contributed $0.10 per share in 2014, $0.08 per share more than 2013, due to improvements in barge freight demand for much of the year. Corporate and other earnings were down $0.09 per share from last year. The 2013 results included the interest income benefit recorded in 2013 associated with the resolution of the U.K. windfall tax issue. In summary, we took advantage of extreme weather conditions, performed well operationally; we were able to get a jump on future spending requirements, and achieved earnings within our raised guidance range; all in all, a successful year financially. Let's take a look at Slide 8 where we can review the normalized load trends for the quarter. By now, you should be familiar with the layout of these charts and how we show the growth with and without Ormet which seized operations in the fourth quarter of 2013. My remarks will reflect the exclusion of Ormet, unless otherwise noted to give you a sense of how our service portfolio is recovering on an ongoing basis. Starting in the lower right corner, you can see that overall weather normalized load was up 3.1% for the quarter. This marks our fifth consecutive quarter with positive normalized load growth. I would also like to point out that the 2.2% growth for the year was the largest annual increase in retail sales since 2010. In the lower left quadrant, you see that our industrial sales volumes were up 3.9% for both the quarter and the year-to-date. We continue to see the strongest industrial sales growth from customers in our oil and gas related sectors which I'll cover in more detail later in the presentation. In 2014, nine of our top 10 industrial sectors experienced compared to last year. The lone exception for the year was mining which was down 3%. For the quarter the sector leaders were pipeline transportation up 61% oil and gas extraction up 11% and primary metals our largest sector which experienced 5% growth for the quarter excluding Ormet. On the upper right of the slide, you can see the commercial sales were up 3.5% for the quarter and were positive for the year for the first time since 2008. We saw the strongest commercial sales growth this quarter in Texas where customer accounts increased by 1.8%. For comparison the AEP systems are commercial customer growth are five tenth of a percent. Finally, in the upper left corner you can see the residential sales were down 2.1% for the quarter and end of the year up 1.1%. While we continue to see steady growth in residential customer accounts in the west both for the residential growth is related to higher customer usage which is consistent with the improving economy in AEP service territory. I should point out that both for the quarter and year we saw the strongest growth in residential and commercial sales in the P&D utility segment where we collect only the wires component due to the unbundled rate structure. In the vertically integrated utility segment where we collect the full bundle grade we actually saw a decline in residential and commercial sales. With that, let's review the most recent economic data for AEP service territory on Slide 9. Starting with GDP you can see that the estimated 2.6% growth for the US economy in the fourth quarter is higher than the 1.7% growth in AEPs aggregate service territory. However in the upper right corner you see that the economy in our western service territory grew by 2.5% in the fourth quarter which nearly matched the US and outpaced our eastern footprint. In the bottom left quadrant you can see the job growth within AEP service territory continues to improve in step with the U.S. employment recovery. Job growth in AEPs western territories exceeded both the US and AEPs eastern service areas. Within AEPs territory we saw the strongest growth in the quarter in the following sectors, natural resources and mining, construction, leisure and hospitality and manufacturing. Now let's turn to Slide 10 to update you on the impact the domestic Shale gas activity is having on AEPs industrial growth. As we've said before we are seeing significant load increases in the part of our service territories that are located in and around major Shale formations. For the quarter, industrial sales in the shale counties were up 23% compared to seven tenth of a percent decline in non-shale counties. For the year we saw a 30% growth in our Shale counties compared to 2013. This Shale region growth activity is significant for AEP because 17% of our industrial sales are located in Shale gas counties.  The bottom of the chart highlights our industrial sales growth by major Shale region. As you can see for the quarter we saw a growth in all five Shale areas with the strongest growth around the Marcellus, Woodford and Utica regions. Finally, we know that the recent decline in the oil prices is sustained will be strong in the headwind in the oil and gas sector in 2015. Fortunately AEP has a diversified industrial base within a service territory to insulate it from down turns in one specific industry. For example, transportation and auto manufacturing would likely benefit from lower fuel prices. This is another example of how AEPs balanced portfolio of utilities provides not only geographical diversification for exposure to weather but also a diversified regional economy to provide steady growth under various economic conditions. Turning to Slide 11, let's review the financial health of the company. Our debt to total cap remains healthy at 54.4%. A credit metrics FFO interest coverage and FFO to debt have improved from last quarter and are solidly in the triple B and BAA1 range at 5.4 times and 21.8% respectively. Our qualified pension funding decreased 2% from last year and now stands at 97% funded. The reduction in the funded position was a result of an increase in planned liabilities driven by a 70 basis point decrease in the discount rate in the adoption of the new mortality table, which was anticipated. An increase in the planned assets tempered the impact of the liability growth during the year. For 2014, our pension funding was $71 million, and we expect to make a contribution of $87 minimum in 2015. O&M expense associated with our pension was $103 million in 2014, and is expected to be about $84 million in 2015. Since our Op '10 [ph] funding is at 118%, no funding was required in 2014 and none will be needed in 2015. Finally, our liquidity stands at nearly $3 billion, and is supported by our two revolving credit facilities that extend into the summers of 2017 and 2018. During the fourth quarter of last year, our treasury group posted with our banking partners to amend and expand those key facilities. In doing so, we were able to modify the facilities in such a way that the bank's capital requirements would be reduced, while at the same time, providing a benefit to AEP by expanding the tenure and taking advantage of improved pricing. We worked hard over the last several years to achieve the financial strength demonstrated on the slide, and we believe we're well positioned for the future. Turning to Slide 12, I'll try to wrap this thing up, I know that 2014 is now ancient history, so let me close by providing an update for 2015. We're reaffirming the guidance range, as Nick said that we provided to EEI last November of $3.40 to $3.60 per share. Here are some of the drivers you should think about that impacted the guidance range. We have a positive track record in putting capital to work for the benefit of our customers and then earning a return on that investment are efficiently getting it into rates. This year should continue that trend with expected rate changes of approximately $200 million, similar to last year. We are encouraged by the recent experience in our residential, commercial, and industrial classes. And we expect the modest load increase this year of 6.10% [ph]. Our continued investment in transmission infrastructure should provide approximately $0.07 per share growth, and we will look for opportunities to employ additional capital in that area just as we've done in the last couple of years. We're maintaining the discipline around operations and maintenance expenses, and because of our cost reduction initiatives as well as the cost we shipped into 2014, O&M should be a positive driver for 2015. In regards to the challenges we face for 2015, I think you're well aware of them; from the earnings shortfall from the PJM capacity pricing and the retail stability rider, the lower natural gas prices and power prices and their impact on our system sales. The capacity in RSR issues have been known for some time, and it is still very early in the year to make any changes based on current energy prices. At this point of the year, we're still comfortably within the previously announced range. In summary, the company is financially strong, and we're well in our way to meeting our stated goals. With that, I will turn the call over to the operator for your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Dan Eggers at Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Dan Eggers : Hi, good morning, guys. Nick Akins : Good morning, Dan. Dan Eggers : Hey, guys. I know there is going to be a lot of Ohio questions in a minute, so I wanted to hit a couple of others, first. On the transmission business, with the -- if you read IPO out in the market, how are you guys thinking about the future of your transmission business, given the size and the growth potential there, and respectively other key performance of funding for the business? Nick Akins : Yes, we continue to look at our transmission business as part and parcel to AEP. I mean we obviously have a lot of scope and scale there, but really we continue to find it on a continual basis, and it's important for us to be in a position to be able to grow that business. And really to go to these other structures, there are complications from a state regulatory standpoint and tax hearing standpoint. So at this point I think we're going to continue pursuing transmission in the vein that we have been. Dan Eggers : One of the successes of the transmission issue was you guys kept finding more capital to put into that business. How are you thinking about investment as a baseline for 2015, and what do you think would cause that number to come up as the year progresses? Nick Akins : Yes, so during the year we continually reallocated capital from other business units as part of the business that we are in. One of the process is the great processes we have in place with the capital allocation program and the continual process for reallocation of capital enables us to move more to the transmission side and advance some of that green area that I keep talking about on the graph of additional transmission span that we have available. If we get ahead in some fashion, you never know what the summer will look like, but we'll certainly look for continued ways to improve and put that capital work in the transmission area. Dan Eggers : You guys did a nice job detailing all the earned ROE expectations for the utilities by utility. In aggregate, with this 9.6% earned ROE, should we assume this kind of a normalized earned ROE for you guys? You guys now -- be between cases in different jurisdiction, so not a reason to be optimized the same time as the -- have we seen any improvement in ROEs that we should expect to see after this year? Nick Akins : Yes, I think you can see the stack that we have for regulatory is relatively small compared to previous years as we continue to invest in the regulated businesses. You're going to continue to see sort of a ten-ish, around 10% type of ROE. So we expect as we continue to make progress, we have invested heavily in transmission, and some of that transmission is also included in the operating companies. And you also have additional distribution spending going on. So we'll continue to make advancements, and cases will become probably much more frequent and less in terms of what the ask is so that we can take advantage of writers and things like that to get more concurrent recovery. So as we progress in that regard, you'll see things like -- and I&M is a perfect example where not only legislative, but from a regulatory stand point we've been able to get pretty substantial capital expense with a timely response in terms of recovery. We have that there transmission. Certainly, we're doing well from Ohio perspective, from a transmission distribution perspective. So those are the kinds of things we'll continue to advance in the other jurisdictions as well. Dan Eggers : Got it. Thank you, guys. Operator : Thank you. Next, we'll go to the line of Anthony Crowdell of Jefferies. Q \u2013 Anthony Crowdell : Hey, good morning Nick, no offense taking -- you mentioned the All Star game this weekend. With the reference to the offering, I'm no sure, if you would add, but the question I have relates to -- you mentioned earlier about the strategic view of the generating assets, and then also maybe obtaining an Ohio PPA, I mean, how would the company approach it if basically the grounds from the Ohio PPA was that AEP had to retain all the generating assets in Ohio? Nick Akins : Yes, so obviously I mean we don't want to talk too much about that because you don't know where things are going to go in this case, but it's our position that it's really no regret strategy for Ohio, given there really shouldn't be a requirement that we continue to own the asset, because what this is really about is reinforcing the value of those resources that they continue to run in Ohio. Now, obviously it's a good thing to have PPA that support contracts and support generating units, and that would be a positive aspect if this says, \"Okay, there is continued consistency in terms of recovery around the cost related to these assets,\" and that would be a good thing. So we're going to just have those kinds of discussions, but obviously as we pursue it we want to see that we have the ability to do whatever we decide to do from a business standpoint, but make sure that those assets are standing there for our Ohio customers though. We'll just have to see where that goes. Q \u2013 Anthony Crowdell : Great, thank you very much. Nick Akins : Yes. Operator : Thank you. We'll go next to the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead. Q \u2013 Paul Patterson : Good morning. Nick Akins : Good morning, Paul. Paul Patterson : Can you hear me? Nick Akins : Oh, yes, good morning. How're you doing? Q \u2013 Paul Patterson : All right, just on the O&M shift, I apologize if I missed this; from 2015 to 2014, how much of that quantifiable -- I apologize if you -- I mean I was loosening, I just don't know if I missed it. How much of that was put in 2014 that's going to be coming out in 2015 and 2016? Nick Akins : Yes, about 60 million was moved forward from '15 and '16 into '14. Q \u2013 Paul Patterson : Okay, great. And then with respect to the AEP merchant operation I guess obviously there are a lot of moving pieces, and I can appreciate that. But I'm just wondering, what are the chances that you guys could retain this business? How should we think about this? Nick Akins : Obviously, we're going to have to go through the evaluation processes to determine exactly what we do. But our going in position is we're regulated utility. And \u2013 and the two things that we're trying to get out of this process was to make sure that we took volatility out of that out of the unregulated business. And we're able to make long-term investments. Now, that's relatively a hard hurdle. But nevertheless we have to go through the process of understanding the capacity market reform, what happens to PPA as to solidify those assets, what happens to energy markets when the other coal units around 5700 Megawatt of coal fire generation gets retired here in May. And then sort of two other things going on and that is these [pieced up] metal auctions that are occurring and if FERC approves the capacity performance model and have these other auctions, those maybe considerable value propositions that we're going to have to know and understand. So I said the first issue was going to drop around the ESP III filing and be up to the commission when they actually render an order on the follow up to that, which is for the larger piece of assets and that's around 2700 megawatts. So it's going to be depended upon the timing and our understanding of the value proposition associated with that business. And I think you said that correct earlier. There are a lot of moving parts here. But they are parts that are starting to come together in 2015. Q \u2013 Paul Patterson : Okay. So it is safe to say sort of that if you don't do out of priority it's going to be above the merchant operations due to let's say ESP not working out as planned or whatever, would it be less likely that you guys would end up retaining the asset? Does that make sense? Nick Akins : Yes, that makes sense. Q \u2013 Paul Patterson : Okay, thanks so much. Operator : We'll go next to the line of Hugh Wynn with Stanford Bernstein. Nick Akins : Hi, Hugh. Q \u2013 Hugh Wynn : Hi, first one on Slide 7. You've explained how some of the 2015-16 O&M expansions were brought forward. There is another factored key that I wanted you to shed some light on. The biggest contributors to higher earnings this year were I think the -- among the biggest contributors were the OSF, $0.16 and AGR, $0.11 you also got a nice added benefit from the AP river operations and some significant portion of that on the OSF and AGR obviously reflected Q1 weather and market conditions. I imagine the AEP river operations reflected to some extend very benign growing condition and record corn harvest. My question is how should I think about 2014 away from the impact that weather had on generation and shipping volume to AEP River? Nick Akins : Yes, I think one thing is load obviously was increased during that period of time. And then there was an enabling factor here where with load with obviously with the unregulated generation was able to do relative to margins. We were able to take advantage of that, and certainly, offload some of the '15 and '16 impacts. But I'd say the year when you look at the foundational issues that we have from the regulatory recovery to the -- to what the service territory looks like it's doing in terms of load increases and the makeup of that load is probably very -- I mean that would be very good for us from a foundational perspective going forward. I think you all look at 2014 as a very successful year ended that we took advantage of the upside that existed because of frankly the polar vortex and how we performed with our units and also being able to give some of the regulatory actions in place, so I'd say 2014 was -- if you took out -- if you adjusted out the you know what we're made in off-system sales relative to the polar vortex, then we probably would not have taken some of the steps that we took and still would've managed the year in a very positive way. Q \u2013 Hugh Wynn : So with that, basically you're suggesting I think that we should be looking at 14 as have reflected off the line earnings power given the frontloading of the O&M offsetting the Q1? Nick Akins : That's right I think 2014 turned out to be a major positional year for us because we took advantage of some of the things that occurred during the year and that's really as I said earlier that's the true story of not only 2014 but the last quarter. We took advantage of the upside that occurred during the year but we didn't do it you know just by doing additional things we did it by managing our \u2026 managing the future in terms of the earnings power of the Company as well. So you know that's really the story of the year. Q \u2013 Hugh Wynn : That relate that question on 8/10 [ph], I assume nonetheless that the -- correct me if I'm wrong here, the relatively low growth that you're anticipating and residential normalized sales and commercial normalized sales despite accelerating GDP growth and improving employment and consumer confidence and all those good things. Still reflects you know some element of the first quarter strength that you feel was probably not going to be repeated even in this normalized basis so in other words you're working off of a very high base and its going to be harder replicate equivalent levels of growth in the coming year. Nick Akins : I think that's the last comment you made kind of hits a nail in the head, because our growth was so strong in 2014 we don't think it will be as strong as we go into 2015 and that's why you see the numbers for the estimates reflected on slide 8 that you do. Q \u2013 Hugh Wynn : Okay, and what\u2026 Brian Tierney : And you got to keep in mind too I mean we do the best job we can in terms of anticipating what load forecast looks like but in this economy and with what's going on particularly when you're on the -- where its adjusting considerably as we go along we tend to be a pretty conservative branch. And it's done that way because \u2026 because it's sort of a foreseeing function for the rest of the business to compensate for what we could have is \u2026 is you know very low load growth depending on what happens to the world economy oil and gas prices. We just have to see some consistency in all this has to be really positive to make further adjustments in the future and that's going to play itself out. Q \u2013 Hugh Wynn : Now that conservatism on a load forecast and the calculation of adjustment range is much appreciated; just one last thing, what -- have you guys disclosed any expectations regarding the pace of O&M growth off of the 2014 base? Nick Akins : Yeah, we -- we thank you it will be flat to slightly positive when you look at the utility segment net or earnings offset at about $3.1 billion in O&M. we anticipate that to be perhaps closer to about $3 billion in 2015. So we do expect some uptick in O&M and that's as a result to some of the things that we talked about, pulling some of those expenses and work associated with those expenses forward in the 2014 through 2015 and 2016. Brian Tierney : The fascinating part about all of that is that we continue to absorb additional increases in O&M you know for labor costs, for certainly for cyber security, physical security all those things that are occurring in addition so it's \u2026 its more than just you know keeping that flat. It's really absorbing substantial changes. Q \u2013 Hugh Wynn : Got it, thank you. Operator : We will go next from the line of Jonathan Arnold at Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Jonathan Arnold : Yeah, good morning guys. Nick Akins : Good morning. Jonathan Arnold : Firstly I wanted to ask on the comment you made about residential sales being primarily up on usage rather than customer count in the west, are you seeing a some kind of a softening in the efficiency angle or can you just give us a little bit more color on your confidence in the source of that growth and the -- as if likely trajectory? Brian Tierney : Yeah, Jonathan this is Brian. In some of the parts particularly T&D utilities where we're seeing a lot of Shale industrial growth is where we've seen a lot of the average usage growth go up. And in places that aren't impacted by that we've actually seen a decline in average customer usage. So if as utilities we look at for industrial the lead commercial and residential growth that's very much been the case in the places where we see the Shale developments. I guess looking forward in terms of energy efficiency I think a lot of the energy efficiency to date in the states where we have energy efficiency initiatives have been focused more on the residential class and we anticipate some of that low-hanging fruit gets taken, some of that would start shifting with the commercial class and we'll start to see some impacts there as well. But that's sort of a \u2026 the color I'd give you on where we're seeing the load growth and why. Nick Akins : Brian alluded to this earlier and that is the shift its occurring if we see the oil and gas impacts relative to Shale gas activity well you still have gasoline and basic energy prices that are reducing that so that would have an effect of improving the residential and commercial side as well, so because this part of the economy obviously the benefit from more disposable income so it would be interesting to see as the year goes on how this develops. We're just out the beginning of you know being in wash and shale gas and that kind of thing. But with gasoline prices lower it may enable people to start purchasing more homes and those types of things that move the economy. Jonathan Arnold : Great thanks and so you've kind of see trend 2015 sales outlook by 30 basis points, is that -- and you've talked about other parts of the economy offsetting shale, can you -- how much of the -- is the kind of Shale slowdown is seem to be versus what you were expecting? Nick Akins : Jonathan, when you look at -- when you say we've trimmed it by 30 basis points it's really adjusting the base that we're operating off of. So it's the higher base in 2014 that really accounted for the reduction in 2015 on a year-over-year basis. Does that make sense? Jonathan Arnold : Yeah. If my memory serves, you did that last year too\u2026 Nick Akins : Yeah, that happens. Jonathan Arnold : Anything happens. Great. Could I just ask one other thing -- on this EEI slides I think you said you said you had 80% of generation gross margin, you know locked in some form of a contract or hedging. Is there an update to that number? And I guess you know maybe that hedges would be a bigger percentage of a smaller number so maybe adjusting for any change in the overall outlook. Nick Akins : Yeah., John, we don't like to give obviously a specific number but when you think about what we try and have hedged we try and be in that 60% to 70% hedged range. And I think that would be a fair assumption looking forward as well. He worries about comparative information so\u2026 Jonathan Arnold : Right, right. Nick Akins : But that's a general rule of thumb that he is \u2026 Jonathan Arnold : But having said you did say you were at 80 in November. Yes, okay they're not -- you're not saying that's changed \u2026 are you Brian when you say 60 to 70? Brian Tierney : No, I'm not -- there's no change. When we talk about the range we like to be hedging and -- you also need to think about whether its volume or margins. Jonathan Arnold : Right. Brian Tierney : So I think the margin that you're referencing is higher in terms of volume it would be lower amount. Jonathan Arnold : Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you we'll go next to the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc. Nick Akins : Hello Paul. How're you. Paul Ridzon : Just fine. Goes back to Hugh's question about Memco, was 2014 a good year or 2013 a poor year? Brian Tierney : Hi, Paul. It's a combination of both. But 2014 was a good year primarily we're starting to see earnings capability from the tanker barges. You know we also had a good grain season that continues. But at the tanker -- our entry into the tanker barge business has been successful. Paul Ridzon : But I think Nick's initial statement hit the nail on the head; '13 was not a good year and '14 was a good year. Brian Tierney : So, '15 may be split the difference. We like to see it continue like '14 was and as Nick said we're getting higher margins from some of the tanker barges that we have. And we anticipate that we'll continue to grow that part of the business where we get the higher margin. Paul Ridzon : And then on transmission, I think you finished the year $0.02 ahead of plan. Should we assume that '15 can -- that carries you can finish $0.02 ahead of '15's plan? Brian Tierney : Yes, we're thinking that the transmission side will improve 14 as a result by about $0.07 per share. Paul Ridzon : That kind of put you on top of where your EEI lies at, $0.38? Brian Tierney : That's about right. Nick Akins : Yes, that's right. Paul Ridzon : Okay, thank you very much. Paul Ridzon : Okay. Thanks, Paul. Operator : We'll go next to the line of Ali Agha with SunTrust. Please go ahead. Ali Agha : Good morning. Nick Akins : Good morning. Ali Agha : Just making sure I understand on the merchant thinking in your part as you dealt that number of data points coming up. But if I hear them and the timing of all of those looks like by middle of this year, you should be in a position to strategically decide your next step. Is that a fair when you think about it? Nick Akins : I think as it now stands, you're going to have a lot of that information by mid-year. Now, it remains be seen what the commission does strategically that probably utility commission of Ohio relative to the second increment the 2700 megawatts generation if that to occur before May or after May I don't know at this point. And then what FERC does with the supplemental options, if you have supplemental options particularly that add tremendous value proposition form the existing auction period like the '16 and '17 auctions. There could be a supplemental auction associated with that, and then others as well. Then we are going to have to fully understand what that means. I'm sure if there is a transaction -- any transaction party would want to understand that too. So as a general thought process, we're thinking of lot of the information coming to play in '15. We're hopeful that a lot of that comes into play in mid-15. But we'll have to see where that goes. Ali Agha : Yes, and conceptually on the part as you thought about actually exiting the business. You looked at two parts; actual sale monetization raising cash re-investment in that and then spin-offs where you save some of the tax leakage. As you got more data, you've gone down the part any clarity or preferences between those parts? Nick Akins : No, not yet. There are some big opponents sitting out there that we have to fully understand. Obviously be great to take precedes and re-invest in the business, particularly in transmission. But each one of those options that you mentioned has its pros and cons. We need to make sure we have all these major factual items to make a sound decision. Ali Agha : Generally, you do believe that its capital still out there, you will be back this big PJM-related transaction if that have happened recently that's still capital availability out there that is willing to spend more money in that region? Nick Akins : Yes, I do. I think there is. And obviously some of the latest information on market power concerns and those kinds of things will -- it really depends on who the other parties are. So, we'll have to -- that's another issue that we'll have to fully understand. I do believe that is out there. Ali Agha : Okay. And in the past when you guys have talked about your merchant sensitivities and exposures you related there to power prices, dollar change equations to certain earnings per share. But is there sensitivity on the fuel side as well? In other word, oil prices obviously have come down so have coal prices. So should we think more along the dark spread side of the equation or is the sensitivity all still on the power side on the merchant part? Nick Akins : Yes, I think obviously capacity prices has the big part of the value proposition for those assets and as far as the energy market is concerned, you'd have to look at the energy market and say, \"Okay, what's the margin expectation from that part of the business?\" So margins are a little bit depressed in this market, but not too depressed, and really -- like I said earlier, it really depends upon someone else's view what the forward curve looks like. So there will obviously be discussions about long-term forward curve and what it looks like for energy process, but the real definition around this will be provided in the capacity side. Ali Agha : Understood, thank you. Nick Akins : Yes. Bette Jo Rozsa : Operator, we have time for one more question. Operator : Thank you. And our last question will come from the line of Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, sir. Nick Akins : Hey, Michael. Michael Lapides : Hey, Nick. Hey, Brian. When I look at the equalizer slide, it's the slide you show on earned ROEs across various segments. Can you just walk us through -- I know you've got the Kentucky rate case outstanding, and now it will have a big impact, but can you walk us through a little bit about what you think will improve things so much at both the I&M and SWEPCO? I mean the SWEPCO $50 million increases are relatively small number in the size and scale of SWEPCO; just kind of how do you get such a big uplift when you look at pro forma versus earned in 2014? Brian Tierney : Yes. Let me give you some quick insight on the I&M. So obviously they have some plans that are going to retire next year. So what we did in 2014 was look forward at what some of the severance and additional retirement obligations were going to be, and because when you could quantify those and have some real clarity into what those would look like we were able to take those charges in 2014 and won't be realizing those in '15. So '14's results were weighted down by our estimating and calculating those results we take them in 2014, and obviously not having similar results in 2015 in I&M will help us to improve those results there. Nick Akins : And then for SWEPCO, it's going to be -- we're not going to define an Arkansas solution here, because we got the formal rate changes in Louisiana, really taking into account the Valley district, it was required there, and then in Texas we do have full recovery for Turk, but also the transmission, T-cost filings and so forth have been positive. So those two jurisdictions are working very well. Arkansas is a work in progress, because we're not only -- we're now investing in Scrubber applications, environmental expense at Welsh and Flint Creek power plants. And that's somewhat of a drag, but we've got to get through in some kind of ability to get through either Turk or some rate case support for Arkansas. So, now, Arkansas' returns other than if you exclude Turk are generally okay, but whether it takes an account the risk associated with Turk is another issue, and we've got to find a mechanism to get more value for that previous Arkansas portion of Turk; the 88 megawatts. Michael Lapides : And you think until that solved? Nick Akins : Until that solved, you'll continue to see SWEPCO somewhat depressed. Michael Lapides : Got it. And you think you can get some change in Arkansas done in 2015 to drive that 150 basis points or so increase in ROE? Nick Akins : You're talking about above the 8.3%\u2026 Michael Lapides : Just to go from 6.8 to 8.3. Nick Akins : No. Yes. But he is asking how to get from 6.8 from 8.3. Brian Tierney : Yes, we will be able to do that. Nick Akins : We'll be able to do that, because that doesn't include Turk. That really is recovery of the environmental expense. Michael Lapides : Got it, okay. I will follow-up online. Nick Akins : Okay. Bette Jo Rozsa : Okay, thank you everyone for joining us on today's call. As always, the IR team will be available to answer any questions you may have. Keeley, you give the replay information now. Thank you. Operator : Thank you.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to our host, Ms. Betty Jo Rozsa. Please go ahead. Betty Jo Rozsa : Thank you, Brad. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the first quarter 2015 earnings webcast for American Electric Power. We are glad that you were able to join us today. Our earnings release presentation slides and related financial information are available on our website, at aep.com. Today we will be making forward- looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from the statements. Please refer to our SEC filing for a discussion of these factors. Joining me for the call today are Nick Akins, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Tierney, our Chief Financial Officer. We will take your questions following their remarks. I will now turn the call over to Nick. Nick Akins : Thanks, Betty Jo. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the AEP first quarter 2015 earnings call. Just as with first quarter of 2014, we are off to a great start in 2015, with AEP earnings coming in for the quarter at $1.29 per share on a GAAP basis and $1.28 per share on an operating earning basis. This compares with 2014 first quarter earnings of $1.15 per share on both GAAP and operating basis. So we're very pleased with these strong results and the progress we have made. Just as with first quarter 2014, the cold weather and generation performance contributed heavily to these positive results. First quarter 2014 was the coldest in 35 years; first quarter 2015 was the second coldest. But this isn't the only story for the quarter. With weather year-on-year being about the same and earnings being higher than first quarter of last year, the difference is the progress we have made in advancing our growth strategy. This strategy of investing in the regulated companies, particularly Wires and Transmission, focus on continuous improvement initiatives, such as lean practices, the crescendo in savings over time. And a culture of continued disciplined execution of our employees around operational excellence continues to produce positive results. We continue our commitment to this path and reaffirm our previous guidance of $3.40 to $3.60 per share and a 4% to 6% earnings growth trajectory. I know everyone gets excited and believes we should raise guidance, but remember, we are on a multi-year plan of consistent earnings growth and one quarter does not make a year. We are mindful of softer market conditions because of low natural gas prices, changes in seasonal rate structures in Ohio that reduce summer rates that existed before, and we still have significant outstanding rate cases in Kentucky and West Virginia, not to mention the timing of capacity performance in PPA outcomes to consider. We also continue to look for opportunities to advance spending from 2016 into 2015 to further mitigate the PJM capacity auction revenue deficiency in 2016 that we have been discussing for a couple of years now. The economy, which Brian will go into more detail in a few minutes, continues to improve. But once again, we were reluctant to change the forecast, at this point, because of results for load in the quarter, particularly in the residential sector, as Brian will discuss later. Along with a slow down in new wellhead activity, we will monitor the impact of low energy prices overall in the economy. Low energy prices have benefited parts of our economy, but more time is needed to evaluate this trend. Our process improvement initiatives continue on pace and we continue to be pleased with the results. With the cultural initiatives through our Power Up and lean process, along with lean activities and the ultimate reward of very positive employee incentive results for 2014, employees are energized and focused to achieve our process improvement and savings objectives. We have completed Lean implementation at 13 plants, including Cook Nuclear, and have 4 to go this year. 13 distribution districts are completed, with a remaining 19 in process to be completed in 2015. Additionally, in Transmission, one area has been completed, with the other 4 slated for this year. Other areas, such as procurement, central repair shops, customer and distribution services, IT, commercial operations, materials management, et cetera are either completed or in process. We plan to complete all of the initial reviews in the company by the end of the year, to get the full benefit of 2016 and beyond. Speaking of baseload generation, before \u2013 regarding the February, 2015 ESP order from the Public Utility Commissions of Ohio that contained the PPA proposal regarding the OVEC units, among other riders approved and some denied, the Commission did approve the PPA rider mechanism as a non-bypassable rider, but denied the inclusion of the OVEC units. The order provided several factors to be considered when future PPA filings are made. AEP filed a rehearing request in late March on this issue and others. And I've since learned that the Ohio Commission did accept the rehearing request. We also, in October, 2014, filed a larger PPA proposal for several other units amounting to approximately 2,700 megawatts. And we will supplement that filing soon with additional information requested from the ESP order and will recommend an expedited procedural schedule from the Commission. With no long-term price signals from the PJM capacity market that support baseload generation, it is imperative that Ohio defines an energy policy that makes sense for Ohio consumers, those that invest in generation, and for the state of Ohio from an economic development tax and jobs perspective. It is clear that the Rube Goldberg capacity market of PJM can not be depended upon to provide consistent revenue and price discovery to enable the long-term investment potential and maintenance of existing baseload generation. Ohio must regain control of its ability to define resources within the state. With regard to PJM, AEP believes PJM is trying, in some ways, to fix the problem, and we appreciate that. AEP is hoping FERC will realize the importance, as well, of baseload generation for power energy and ancillary services that enable our power system to operate properly. PJM's capacity performance proposal is a step in the right direction and should be a no-brainer to FERC. With that said, PJM received a deficiency notice from FERC in February that asked the several questions to supplement the record. From Commissioner Moeller's dissent, it appears there is some support for this proposal. And hopefully, after review of PJM's responses to the questions posed by the Commission, this proposal will be approved, demonstrating the Commission's concern regarding baseload generation in organized capacity markets. I just got back from the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction this weekend, so I still have music on my mind. So there is a song I recall that has the lyrics that a choice not to decide is still a choice. We see this indecision in both Ohio and at FERC with the PPA and capacity performance filings. These cases do have consequences. A vote for these plans are votes for stability of pricing to consumers, reliability of the grid, and the financial integrity of those that provide a critical service to our economy and our way of life. Doing nothing is not the right answer. On the state regulatory front, the two major cases I spoke of earlier in West Virginia and Kentucky are moving along. In Kentucky, the fuel recovery case took an odd twist in January when the Kentucky Commission rejected recovery of Mitchell no-load fuel cost, even though we accounted for the treatment of these costs for decades in the same way. We filed an appeal in the Franklin Circuit Court, which in April was stayed pending the outcome of the two-year fuel case at the Commission. Regarding the Kentucky $70 million rate case, most testimony has been filed and the hearings begin May 5. Settlement discussions are occurring and we are hopeful that this can get done soon. Regarding the $227 million rate case in West Virginia, all testimony and hearings are concluded and we expect to get an order by the end of May. Because of the chronically low ROEs in West Virginia for several years, we were not able to settle, so we expect the Commission to render an order on this one. While we understand the economy in West Virginia has been challenged, it appears to be improving somewhat; and investment is needed to maintain and improve quality of service to West Virginia customers. The clean power plan debate continues on several fronts. This week, NERC released its report, which follows what AEP has been saying all along, the 2020 targets are not achievable, state review tiled lines, proper electric system planning timelines, construction schedules for replacement resources, and system reliability implications must be respected. Many stakeholders, including several states are raising red flags regarding this expansive proposed rule that impacts the resources we use and how we use them to serve our customers. FERC technical conferences continue to confirm the issues of the aggressiveness of the 2020 targets and the need for reliability safeguard mechanisms. We are hopeful that EPA will actively listen to these major concerns and that the final rule, due out during the summer, will resolve some of these concerns. From AEP\u2019s perspective, as the owner and operator of the largest transmission system in this country, including the 765KV backbone of the Eastern interconnect, and one of the largest generators in the country, we take our responsibilities regarding the reliable operation of our grid seriously. We stand ready to work with all stakeholders including the EPA, Congress and the states, to get this right. Too much is at stake. So now I will move on to the equalizer slide, which is page 4 and I will go through some of the states that we are dealing with here. So from an Ohio perspective, this ROE is in line with expectations sot of it\u2019s around 12% to 12.2%, some round off in there. But it\u2019s split between the last and the current ESP period. So we don\u2019t have any concern about those numbers. The PUCO yesterday did accept the application for rehearing of the ESP matters. So that was great news that they were willing to take that on again. As far as APCO is concerned, I just talked about the current West Virginia rate case, so that\u2019s really what is occurring there. And we\u2019ve talked about that for several quarters now. So hopefully, we will get a good outcome on this rate case for that ROE to move up. Kentucky is really atrocious, at this point. It\u2019s at 2.4%. That is because of the regulatory provision that was accorded in the fuel cost recovery disallowance that was related to that Mitchell no-load cost that I talked about earlier. We have the rate case going on there, as well. So hopefully, we will be able to move forward with some type of settlement and improve Kentucky\u2019s situation. I&M will continue to improve. There is great regulatory framework in place there and support for capital programs at Rockport, with solar, with the nuclear lifecycle management, transmission and distribution projects. There is a lot of great work going on there. So we fully expect I&M to continue to improve. PSO is right in line with expectations. There is some O&M timing issues there. But at 9.2%, it\u2019s in pretty good shape. SWEPCO continues to struggle with the Turk portion, the Arkansas portion of Turk. We did get some positive legislation that allowed for the ability to really roll through with a rate case and recover Turk. But we really need to wait for the conditions to be right from a market perspective, so that we can make a proper filing. So we, obviously, are watching that process. In the meantime, SWEPCO continues with additional cases, transmission recovery in Texas. The Louisiana Commission approved the latest rates there, $15 million of revenue additional. And also, new cases will be filed in certain areas of the SWEPCO jurisdictions, as well. So we will continue to see some lagging, but hopefully, we\u2019ll get to a point where we can get the Turk portion all settled out. As far as AP Texas is concerned, it\u2019s come down quite a bit because of increased distribution CapEx. We\u2019re spending a lot of money there, with additional customers being connected and that kind of thing. But also, we\u2019ve had to infuse equity to replace the tax obligations that were due to the related deferred taxes from securitization. So there has been an equity infusion there that\u2019s changed those numbers. And then as far as the Transmission is concerned, the holding company for Transmission is right on target with where it needs to be, and we continue to invest heavily in Transmission. So slightly down from last quarter, it\u2019s 8.7%. But we expect that to come up in future quarters. So with that said, I wanted to talk a little bit about the unregulated generation. That process continues, obviously, with the capacity performance delay that has occurred relative to FERC. Hopefully, FERC will act on that soon, and then the markets can go forward with the capacity auctions, which are of considerable value in this process, we believe. So we need to see the outcome of that, and then see how the PPA process progresses, as well, within the state of Ohio as we move forward in those decisions. But the framework is set. The groundwork is set. We just need to plug in the numbers and understand the valuation. So that\u2019s really an update on that portion of it, at this point. So before I conclude, I want to give a shout out to our employees, who typically listen to some of these calls, particularly at the disposition plants, which among them are those units that will be retiring at the end of May. As you know, we are retiring almost 5,750 megawatts of generation that\u2019s going to retire here in May. The closure of the plant sites is a difficult process, one in which generating units are harvested with a little investment, incquiring the ingenuity of those involved to keep running with, what I call, Swiss cheese boilers. There is also the very personal sacrifice of those employees and their families that will now move on with their lots of others plans pr retire or several from the company. These generating units have provided the backbone of the American dream for decades, providing power to this country and countless benefits to the communities we are privileged to serve. In the age of word coal being a four-letter word in some circles and not even mentioned among America\u2019s resources, even though coal still is the predominant fuel, we want to say thank you and job well done for those that understand what it takes to make our power system work and how important your work has been so long. So overall, a great quarter, a great foundation to build upon, and we continue with all cylinders clicking. So I\u2019ll turn it over to Brian. Brian Tierney : Thank you, Nick, and good morning, everyone. On slide 5, you will see our comparison of 2015 operating results to 2014 by segment for the quarter. Operating earnings for the quarter were $625 million or $1.28 per share, compared to $1.15 per share, or $560 million last year. This solid performance was driven by the execution of our regulatory plans, continued growth in our Transmission segment, O&M cost control, and strong marketing results, which together more than offset the adverse effect of lower wholesale power prices. Weather had an equally strong impact on the first quarters of both 2015 and 2014. With that as an overview, let\u2019s review the major earnings drivers by segment for the quarter on slide 6. 2015 earnings for the vertically integrated Utilities segment work $0.61 per share, up $0.04 from last year. The major drivers for this segment include the favorable effects of rate changes, regulatory provisions, and lower O&M expenses, partially offset by a decline in off-system sales margins and normalized load. Rate changes in regulatory provisions were recognized across many of our jurisdictions, adding $0.04 and $0.03 per share, respectively. The favorable effect of rate changes on earnings is related to incremental investment to serve our customers. The effect of the Virginia rate freeze included in regulatory provisions added $0.03 per share. This segment also benefited from lower O&M expense, primarily due to the reduced employee related costs adding $0.03 per share to the quarterly comparison. The $0.09 per share decline in off-system sales margin was driven by much lower power prices this year. The favorable $0.04 per share PJM expenses was related to high PJM costs during last year\u2019s Polar Vortex events that were not recovered in rates. Normalized load adversely affected the comparison by $0.04 per share and was primarily driven by lower residential sales in the East. I will talk more about load and the economy in a few minutes. The Transmission and Distribution utility segment earned $0.20 per share for the quarter, unchanged from 2014. The Transmission holdco segment continues to grow, contributing $0.07 per share for the quarter, an increase of 40% over last year. Year-over-year, this segment\u2019s net plant grew by approximately $1.1 billion, an increase of 61%. The Generation and Marketing segment produced earnings of $0.38 per share $0.05 to the quarter. This was driven by the strong performance of our Generation and Commercial organizations. The quarterly results also benefited from lower operating expenses at our power plants. AEP River operations contributed $0.02 per share in 2015, $0.01 more than last year, due to lower operating costs. Corporate and other earnings were $0.01 better than last year\u2019s results. In summary, our regulated utilities executed on their rate and investment plans, exercised cost discipline, and benefited from cold weather. In addition, our competitive businesses took advantages of opportunities presented to them. The combination of these efforts allowed us to exceed last year\u2019s first quarter performance by 11%. In all, as Nick said, the Company is off to a good start in 2015. Now let\u2019s take a look at slide 7 to review normalized load performance. Starting in the lower right corner, you can see that weather normalized retail load was down 1.3% compared to last year. Overall, the decline in normalized residential sales more than offset the growth that we saw in our industrial class. In the upper left quadrant, you can see that our residential sales were down 4% compared to last year. However, as Nick said earlier, in 2014, we experienced the coldest winter in AEP\u2019s service territory in over 35 years, including the two Polar Vortex events, which may be skewing the year-over-year comparison. As we discussed previously, we saw consumer behavior change during these extreme weather conditions. So while the #% drop in residential sales this quarter is noticeable, residential usage is in line with expectations. In fact, since 2013, our first quarter residential sales have grown by an average of 0.10% per year, with modest growth in customer accounts being offset by a slight decline in customer usage. Our residential customer growth for this quarter remained steady at 0.30%, in line with last year. This gives us comfort that the load forecast underlying our 2015 guidance is on track. In the upper right corner of the slide, you see commercial sales were down 0.40% for the quarter, consistent with our projection for the year. We saw the strongest commercial sales growth this quarter in the Transmission and Distribution Utilities segment, where customer counts increased by 0.70%. By comparison, the vertically integrated segment saw commercial customer count growth of 0.40%. Finally, in the lower left quadrant, you see our industrial sales growth moderated a bit from last quarter, but still grew by 1.2%. We continue to see robust industrial sales growth from customers in oil and gas-related sectors, despite the recent decline in oil prices, which I will cover in more detail later in the presentation. Outside of the oil and gas sectors, we saw the strongest growth in the chemicals and transportation equipment manufacturing sectors, both of which benefited from low oil and natural gas prices.  With that, let\u2019s review the most recent economic data for AEP\u2019s service territory on Slide 8. Starting with GDP, the estimated 3.3% growth for the U.S. economy eclipsed the 2.1% growth for AEP\u2019s aggregate service territory. The comparison to the U.S. should not be interpreted as weakness within AEP\u2019s regional economy, since we have seen steady growth of over 2% for the last seven quarters. I would like to point out, in the upper right chart, that the improvement we saw in our Eastern footprint this quarter was offset by a modest slowing in our Western footprint, which has greater exposure to falling oil prices. In the bottom left quadrant, you can see that the job market within AEP\u2019s service area continues to improve in step with U.S. employment recovery. Once again, job growth within AEP\u2019s Western territory exceeded both the U.S. and AEP\u2019s Eastern service area. The sectors showing the strongest growth for the quarter included construction, leisure and hospitality, and manufacturing. We should point out that the sector which saw the biggest drop compared to last quarter is the natural resources and mining sector, which is not surprising given the decline in oil prices and active rig counts.  Now let\u2019s turn to Slide 9 to update you on the domestic shale gas activity happening within AEP\u2019s footprint. We are still seeing significant load increases in the parts of our service territory located in and around major shale formations. For the quarter, industrial sales in shale counties were up 14%, compared to the 6.10% decline in non-shale counties. We\u2019ve added the price of oil to the slide, and it shows that while we are still seeing significant growth in industrial sales within our shale counties, the growth has moderated somewhat over the past nine months, as the price of oil began to drop. The bottom chart highlights our industrial sales growth by major shale region. It shows that we are experiencing growth in all the major shale plays within AEP\u2019s service territory with the exception of the Eagle Ford area. The strongest growth for the quarter is happening around the Woodford, Marcellus and Utica shale regions. The shale county charts on Slide 9 show the industrial sales growth for specific geographies, which includes direct, indirect and other support industries, as well.  On Slide 10, I would like to narrow the scope to show you just the industrial sales performance for the oil and gas related sectors. There are three sectors to examine here, oil and gas extraction, which captures the upstream activity of exploration production; pipeline transportation, which captures midstream activity and includes processing, storing and transporting oil and natural gas liquids and petroleum and coal products, which includes downstream activities of refining and producing the finished product. We are using this chart to illustrate a few points. First, we have not seen the impact of falling oil prices in our sales to the oil and gas sectors. We have noticed some impact to customers and support industries, like metals, who provide the tubing used in drilling operations. But our sales to the oil and gas extraction sector continue to grow at a steady pace. This is consistent with the production data published by the Energy Information Administration\u2019s monthly report. Thus far, although rig counts are down 43% from the end of last quarter, production remains near historic levels. The second point to make here is that we are seeing the most substantial growth in sales to midstream customers. In fact, the pipeline transportation sector has been so large that it has jumped from our 10th largest sector in 2013 to the 5th largest sector currently. Finally, while we have heard of a few delayed or canceled projects that were originally planning for later this year, we have also learned of other industrial expansions. In summary, this quarter\u2019s load performance was not a surprise and we are comfortable with our underlying load forecast.  Turning to Slide 11, let\u2019s review the financial health of the Company. Our debt to total capital has improved to 53.8%. Our credit metrics, FFO interest coverage, and FFO to debt have improved from last quarter and are solidly in the BBB and BAA-1 range, at 5.62 times and 22.2%, respectively. The funded status of our qualified pension decreased approximately 1% over the quarter and now stands at 96% funded. This was largely driven by a 19 basis point decrease in the discount rate. The funded status of our OPEB obligation stands at a healthy 116%, down slightly from 118% at year-end. This decrease was also driven by falling discount rates.  In addition, our liquidity position stands at $3.5 billion. This is supported by our two revolving credit facilities that extend into the summers of 2017 and 2018. On a final note, we are working to refinance our AEP Generation Resources $500 million term loan facility. By the end of the month, we intend to close on the new facility that will result in reduced rates and fees while maintaining the strategic flexibility we need at this juncture.  Let me close with Slide 12 by saying the Company is off to a strong start for 2015, with all of our business segments finishing equal to, or better, than last year\u2019s results. We are committed to deliver a 4% to 6% growth rate and we are reaffirming our 2015 operating earnings guidance range of $3.40 to $3.60 per share. As Nick described earlier, we\u2019re in the midst of some key regulatory proceedings in Kentucky and West Virginia that could have significant impact on 2015 earnings and beyond. We are maintaining the discipline around operating expenses that you have come to expect from us.  And finally, Transmission holdco is on track to deliver $0.38 per share of earnings this year, up from $0.31 last year. The investment in critical transmission infrastructure continues to provide us with growth opportunities well into the foreseeable future.  With that, I will turn the call over to the operator for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Daniel Eggers at Credit Suisse. Please, go ahead. Daniel Eggers : Hey, good morning, guys. Nick Akins : Hey Dan, how are you? Daniel Eggers : Great. Thank you. On the Ohio generation conversation, you\u2019ve gotten a little more public as far as your prospective plans for exiting that business. Have we thought about a kind of a timeline of progression of thought, how much clarity do you guys need to see around RPM or around maybe First Energy\u2019s PPA process in Ohio before you feel like you\u2019re at a point where you\u2019re going to optimize the value of those assets? Nick Akins : Yes, so certainly, we need to see, as I mentioned earlier, the capacity performance. Hopefully, FERC will approve that. We can get on with the capacity auctions. We have some interim auctions, as well, as a result of that. And then we also have some auctions on the Ohio side that occur in April/May timeframe. So that\u2019s one set of issues. And that\u2019s on the right side of the ledger. On the left side of the ledger is the PPA issue itself. And it sounds like FE is going to be in hearings in June/July timeframe. So we would want to hear directionally where the Commission is going regarding the PPAs. Obviously, we have the open door in terms of the last order we received that said it was legal and we could do the filings. But we really need some direction in terms of what that means going forward. Now whether that\u2019s defined by the FE case or our rehearing or our case remains to be seen. But certainly, with the new leadership over at the Ohio Commission, we are hopeful that we can see a more consistent approach to this, and make sure we get these orders out quickly so that the market, particularly in Ohio, can understand where we are going next. So those are two big value propositions that we need to get a sense of in this overall process. Daniel Eggers : And I guess you guys have talked about using that money, presumably, I guess, to go into transmission investment or back into the utility business. How quickly can you scale CapEx at transmission, if you were to get that large amount of sale proceeds back in? Is it a multi-year process to deploy the capital? Or how speedy can you be using that money elsewhere? Nick Akins : Yes, so with our Transmission business, we have a really good speed toward moving projects forward. I mean we have a whole litany of projects that are ready, willing and able, from a capital standpoint. So we are ready, from that perspective. But typically, it will take a couple of years before you start to see the earnings from these facilities to be put in place. So it remains to be seen as something we will have to feel our way through, in terms of whether share buy backs, earn outs, or something like that in a transaction. Those things are critically important to determine the amount of dilution during that period of time. And obviously, we are trying to mitigate any dilution that could occur during that period. So a lot of work going into what the options are that are available to us. But just know that we are focused on trying to mitigate any type of transition from that respective. Daniel Eggers : Got it, thank you guys. Operator : And your next question will come from Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Greg Gordon : Thanks. Looking at page 15, on the key drivers for the vertically integrated utilities, there\u2019s a $31 million favorable in the quarter from decreases in unrecovered PJM charges. Can you talk us through what that specifically is? And is that going to annualize, or is that sort of related to Polar Vortex issues? Brian Tierney : Greg, this is Brian. Good morning. It was mostly related to the Polar Vortex issues, and it was related to costs associated with reserves and operating expenses that PJM passed through to us in the real time during those Polar Vortexes, that over time and rates, we could get reflected. But given that it happened realtime and we couldn\u2019t get those get those in rates immediately, we had to eat during 2014. Greg Gordon : Great. While we are on subject of PJM, the deadline for FERC to allow PJM to extend its tariff and hold its capacity auction later in the summer, then the current schedule is tomorrow? Or is your expectation that we\u2019re going to get an extension? Nick Akins : Certainly, that would be the best outcome. Who knows what FERC will come up with. But I would suspect, with the actual operator, in terms of the auctions, requesting that because of the disruption that would occur relative to the market itself, I think it's probably a \u2013 it should be a no-brainer. But it remains to be seen. But our expectation \u2013 I mean we would be surprised if they didn't, at this point. Greg Gordon : I think, so would the market. Nick Akins : Yeah. Greg Gordon : Thank you very much, guys. Nick Akins : Thanks. Brian Tierney : Thanks, Greg. Operator : And our next question will come from Julien Dumoulin with UBS. Julien Dumoulin : Hi, good morning. Nick Akins : Good morning. Julien Dumoulin : So perhaps to follow the sales question, can you comment a little bit about the River operations and where you stand on that, and the thought process about that in the context of a regulated mix a little bit? Nick Akins : Yeah, so as far as River Ops is concerned, we obviously announced that we engaged Morgan Stanley to work with us on that process. That process continues. And it's another one of our commercial business is that we are looking at relative to the valuation and disposition of that business. And they are doing a great job. The company is in great shape. But we want to make sure that it fits strategically within the framework that we have going forward. And so that process continues. And I really can't say anything more about it at this point in time. Julien Dumoulin : Do you have a timeframe that you're thinking about, though, just broadly? Nick Akins : My view is that that transaction, if it were to occur, certainly has less issues with it, in terms of milestones to get through. So I would say that the ease of that transaction is probably very different than the rest of the of the unregulated generation on the commercial side. Julien Dumoulin : Got it. And then turning to the regulated business here, let's go down South, Arkansas. In terms of Turk, can you comment on the process to address that and avenues for this year? Nick Akins : So at this point, I mean SWEPCO is in a situation where the market with natural gas and those types of issues are of legitimate concern. So you want to make sure you can put the best foot forward whenever you do go in for recovery of Turk. And the legislation certainly helped out in terms of bypassing a CCN process and being able to file part and parcel to a rate case type environment. So we have to make sure that from an overall rate case standpoint, that it would make sense to file in Arkansas, not only in terms of valuation of Turk and be able to put forward a credible case, but also where you stand from an overall spend situation in Arkansas, as well. So we're going to have to figure out the timing of that kind of filing. Meanwhile, SWEPCO continues to work on other things to reinforce the valuation. We have a large steel customer that's coming online later on this summer. And also, we've got several other cases in Louisiana and in Texas, with the recovery mechanisms in place there, with formula rates and so forth, and transmission, actually, true ups of those kinds of investments. So it's sort of a patchwork to fill in until such time we can get Turk in line. Julien Dumoulin : Got you. Excellent. Thank you. Nick Akins : Okay. Operator And our next question going to come from Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc. Please go head. Paul Ridzon : Good morning. How are you? Nick Akins : Good morning, Paul. Paul Ridzon : Looking at slide seven, just kind of the residential sales were very strong last year, down this year. But this isn't a weather adjusted slide. Is this just kind of modeling errors on your weather adjustment, because things were so extreme? Nick Akins : Paul, we've been debating this one for a quarter now. But it's sort of interesting. I'll give my rendition, and certainly Brian has a lot deeper information on this. But when I was doing load forecasting early in my career, it was down in Texas. And you'd have 45 days of 100 degree weather. And you'd see this thing occur that would wind up being a step change and a super peak. And I think it wound up with customers deciding, to heck with it, I'm going to turn my air conditioner on in this heat. So you would see a step change. I think you saw the same thing in the Polar Vortex in 2014, where it's consistently sub-zero for a long period of time. And at some point, people decided they wanted to be comfortable. So you're sort of measuring a present day versus an anomaly. And that sort of drives a skewing of the residential information. That is why I said earlier, we want to see how that settles out from quarter to quarter going forward, so we understand exactly what the steady-state aspects of that is. Brian? Brian Tierney : Paul, just adding to that a little bit. I think across the industry, we saw weather normalization in residential in the first quarter of last year look similar to ours. And it looked a little bit out of whack, and it sort of normalized over the balance of the year. That's why, as Nick said, the quarter-on-quarter comparison of this year to last year looks kind of negative. We're interested in seeing how the balance of the year flattens out and what that looks like. But we really believe last year's first quarter weather normalization to be a bit of an anomaly. Paul Ridzon : So it's an art, not a science. Okay. And then last year, after a very strong first quarter, you started talk about pulling forward some O&M from the forward year. At what point are you comfortable doing that in 2015? Nick Akins : Yes, Paul. We're starting that process now. Actually, we've already started it. We do have some O& we've identified that could be pulled forward. But at the same time, it becomes \u2013 we pulled $60 million forward last year. So now, you're really getting into areas where, okay, can you pull forward, from that prospective? So it becomes a little bit more difficult. So we're having to reach deeper and think really hard about how much we can actually move forward. So that process is continuing and something that we are very mindful of, given that we started the year somewhat ahead. Paul Ridzon : Is there reluctance to do it until you get a little more of the year under your belt? Nick Akins : No. No. I think we have identified and started that process and we will continue it on. Now keep in mind, last year we had relatively mild summer. So we will continue looking at the levers and looking at the quarter by quarter performance, and we will make adjustments accordingly. We've gotten pretty good at that. Paul Ridzon : Thank you very much. Nick Akins : Yep. Operator : And our next question in line will come from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please go head. Paul Patterson : Good morning. Can you hear me? Nick Akins : Yes. I can hear you. Paul Patterson : First of all, on the trading business, that seemed to be pretty beneficial this quarter. What are the expectations for the year? Brian Tierney : we think it's in line with what we've previously stated for the business, Paul. There are a couple things going on there. They continue to do their normal activity. So the trading and marketing they do, they had a couple of big deals that they got closed in Texas, which were positive for the quarter. But don't forget that when we laid guidance out for 2015, there is about a $0.35 hit associated with changes in capacity revenues in that business. So we think we're on track. We are little bit skewed towards being ahead for the quarter. But the real drags on that business are going to be the latter half of that year, as we experience the fall off in capacity revenues. Paul Patterson : And what happened in Texas? I'm sorry if I'm missed that. Brian Tierney : We had some normal ongoing marketing activity that we do down there. So as we own these businesses, we're going to continue to operate them with an eye towards the long term. And they were able to renegotiate and change the terms a bit on a couple of contracts that they have down there, which is normal ongoing business for us. But that was beneficial to the quarter. Paul Patterson : Okay. Then in terms of just Ohio, I mean is everything pretty much going to be \u2013 I mean, obviously, there is all this focus on PUCO. Is there any potential for the Governor or any other direction to sort of come from, I guess, legislative or the executive branch, in terms of the direction that the state wants to go into? Or is it really just going to be something that PUCO is going to be wrestling with on its own? Any thoughts about that? Nick Akins : I think for the time being, it\u2019s going to be centered at the Commission, because Andre Porter has moved over as Chairman, who previously was involved with the deregulation that occurred some three years ago. And so he knows and understands the issues. And also hopefully, understands the lessons that have been learned since then, as well. And I think he and the Commission, under his leadership, will continue to provide direction, but also consistency and get these orders done. He has also brought on a new chief of staff, which we have certainly met. And he appears to be very, very professional about what he is doing, as well. So I think with some sense of consistency around leadership and in terms of direction associated with the staff itself, at least I am hopeful that things will start moving pretty expeditiously in Ohio. Paul Patterson : Okay. And then just finally, it was the seams issue between PJM and MISO. There\u2019s been some activity in it. And I think there\u2019s been sort of a push on the part of FERC to move things along. Does that \u2013 do you guys see any significant impact from that, positive or negative? You guys have served in different areas there. And of course, we\u2019ve got questions about what\u2019s going to happen with the merchant sector anyway. But anything we should be thinking about with respect to that and how it might impact your merchant plants? Nick Akins : No. I don\u2019t think we see much impact, from our perspective, and as far as MISO is concerned. I mean, one thing is for sure, they really need to start thinking \u2013 PJM and MISO need to administer that contract they have with each other, from an operational standpoint. I know there have been issues that have come up relative to how they actually administer the flows over the lines. But I think as far as we\u2019re concerned, though, we\u2019re in pretty decent shape. Paul Patterson : Okay. Great. Thanks so much. Operator : And our next question will come from Brian Henn with Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Q \u2013 Brian Henn : Hi, good morning. Just a quick one. Nick Akins : Good morning. Q \u2013 Brian Henn : On the 4% to 6% EPS CAGR growth rate outlook, in general is there a Brent crude oil price environment that you are thinking about when you reaffirm that guidance? I realize these things are probabilistic. But it would be helpful to know if you\u2019ve got an oil price in mind. Nick Akins : Certainly, we haven\u2019t gotten down into the fundamentals that much. But from our perspective, it\u2019s really around natural gas pricing. As far as oil pricing is concerned, it\u2019s a measure of how much the rig count changes. But that\u2019s reflected in natural gas as well. So from our perspective, we continue to look at, at least our factors relative to the industrial mix that we have and the impact of energy prices, because even low oil prices can reflect well in the economy that we serve. And so we have sort of a natural hedge going on here, where oil and gas pricing has benefited some counties, with shale gas production and that kind of thing. But on the other hand, low natural gas prices have helped chemical manufacturing, car manufacturing and so forth. Brian, do you have anything you want to add? A \u2013 Brian Tierney : That last point that you got nailed it in my mind, Nick, in that we do have that natural hedge going on. And we see things like transportation equipment manufacturing is positively impacted by the low oil and gas pricing. So where we see some delays or closures in terms of economic expansion, we also see some expansions going on. And those things, to date, have really offset one another. Q \u2013 Brian Henn : Appreciate it. Thank you. Nick Akins : Thank you. Operator : And the next question will come from Anthony Crowdell with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Anthony Crowdell : Good morning, guys. I have a question on slide 6. I guess in three of the business segments, you guys had some cost-cutting error, some cost management where O&M was off, operating costs were a positive driver. How much more can we expect of that going forward, or is this more of a timing issue? Nick Akins : Some of it is timing. But overall, you will continue to see O&M continue to be consistent from the perspective of ensuring that we mitigate any increases. Because obviously, you have overheads, salaries, those kinds of things continue to go up. But we\u2019re mitigating that, in many respects, from an O&M perspective. So our O&M stack continues to be consistent, relatively consistent from year-to-year. We expect that to happen. So Brian, you may have something else. A \u2013 Brian Tierney : Anthony, we\u2019ve worked really hard to keep that O&M flat to down over the last several years. And then looking out into 2016, as we have those capacity revenue challenges in that year, we are very, very focused on keeping O&M in a very tight range. We have been able to keep it in that $2.9 billion, $2.8 billion to $3.1 billion range, even with some of the natural increases that you would expect that we would have associated with things like our transmission expansion. So the Lean activities that Nick talked about have us very focused on O&M, keeping it flat to down over the long term. What you see on slide 6 is what you should anticipate seeing going forward as well. Nick Akins : So I think it may be a part of both. But keep in mind that there will be a consistent view toward that perspective. Anthony Crowdell : Great. And just lastly, I know you\u2019ve probably spoken ad nauseum of it, just the unregulated generation in Ohio. If I understand correctly, before any decision is made on how AEP handles it, you want some clarity on the capacity performance auction and also the Ohio PPA process. Is that accurate? Nick Akins : Yes. That\u2019s accurate. Anthony Crowdell : Great. Thank you so much for taking my questions. Operator : And our next question will come from Ali Agha with SunTrust. Ali Agha : Thank you. Nick Akins : Good morning, Ali. Ali Agha : Good morning. How are you? Nick Akins : Fine, fine. Ali Agha : Nick, just listening in to the commentary and from the results as well, is it fair to assume that first quarter puts you somewhat ahead of budget? Obviously, it\u2019s very early in the year. And if so, how much cushion is there for you right now \u2013 you talked about pulling forward some expenses. Is there any way to quantify how much cushion you have as we look for the rest of the year? Nick Akins : I think we have enough cushion to be comfortable with starting to take steps and being more aggressive about what we do, relative to moving O&M up and doing other things to reinforce the issues that we have in 2016. So just as with last year, where we got ahead, we will be looking at taking additional steps. And we will manage that from quarter to quarter. In this case, though, I think you have a quarter where, certainly it looks \u2013 it\u2019s really positive. But you have a different set of underlying factors to consider, like last year at this point in time, there really wasn\u2019t much of a rate stack to fill in or anything like that. And this time, there is some larger swings that can occur. So I would say, overall, we are very confident about our ability to aggressively pursue in a positive way. Obviously, it\u2019s a better problem to have than if it was on the downside. So we feel good about where we are at. Brian Tierney : Ali, you\u2019ve come to expect from us over the years that we are going to manage our way through a year and across years. And that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re doing. So the guidance that we laid out, we are still comfortably within that guidance for the year. And as the year goes on, depending on what happens with earnings and cash flows and the like, you\u2019re going to see us managing our way to stay in a range that puts us in that guidance, and then within that 4% to 6% growth range that we\u2019ve talked about over several years. Ali Agha : Got it. And also, just to clarify another point on the merchant, in the past, Nick, you\u2019ve been fairly consistent that you expected to reach a resolution over the summer timeframe. We have talked about some things getting pushed back. Even if the PJM capacity gets pushed back, I think they\u2019re still talking June through August. So I guess technically still in the summer. But the PPA rider may be further down the road. So is summertime still what we should think about? Or how should we think about, given some of these delays in some of these milestones? Nick Akins : Yes. I think it\u2019s difficult to tell at this point. Because obviously PJM is trying to push aggressively to get the auction done as quickly as possible. So if we hit early summer and that kind of thing \u2013 and then the previous questioner obviously was asking somewhat the same thing. From the Ohio perspective, we just need to know directionally what Ohio is going to do. So whether that comes from our rehearing, or FE\u2019s PPA case, or ultimately our larger PPA case, we just need to understand what that sense of direction is going to be. And so I am not going to say it\u2019s going to fall back at this point, from a decisional process. Certainly, the delay takes away some of the wiggle room that you had for the summer. But it\u2019s really hard to hard to say, at this point. We will have to keep our ear close to the ground, in terms of what FERC is doing and what the Ohio Commission is doing to resolve that issue. I guess my main point is that we have gone through the analysis. Our Board has been involved every step of the way. So our reaction time is very minimal, at this point. We just need the factual information. Ali Agha : Okay. And one last quick question. In your longer term Transmission growth slide that you\u2019ve shared with us, you\u2019ve had higher growth case scenarios, particularly for 2016 and 2017 that are fairly meaningfully higher than base scenarios. Any of those projects yet that are moved into base, as we look in the 2016-2017 outlook? Brian Tierney : Not in that timeframe. We\u2019ve been able to fill in some of the gap in 2015, so far. But Ali, as you look at some of the earlier questions that we got, if there are going to be transactions, in terms of use of proceeds, that\u2019s primarily where we would be focused on filling in the gaps. Ali Agha : All right. Got it. Thank you. Brian Tierney : Thanks. Nick Akins : We\u2019re focus is really on 2016 and the issues around that. Because we certainly want to give some sense of continuous improvement in terms of earnings and be able to really approach that in the right way. So 2017 and 2018 and beyond, we\u2019ll probably have more color on that by the time EEI rolls around in November. Operator : And next question will come from Michael Lapides, Goldman Sachs. Michael Lapides : Hey guys, congrats on a good start of the year. Brian Tierney : Thanks, Michael. Michael Lapides : When we think about last year, you had a great first quarter, and you talked about moving some O&M into 2014. And you\u2019ve talked a little bit about doing it this year, although it sounds like there is not as much wiggle room there. One of the other things you did last year is you moved up a couple hundred million dollars of transmission spend into 2014, or you raised your transmission CapEx view, for prompt here. Just curious whether you\u2019re likely to do the same thing this year, given such a strong or healthy start to the year. Brian Tierney : Michael, a couple of things on that. One is, we had about a $200 million planned and funded to higher transmission spend. We\u2019ve been able to move dollars out of other CapEx buckets that we\u2019ve had into transmission. And that includes both the transmission holdco and the vertically integrated utilities transmission spend. So of that $200 million, we\u2019ve been able to fund about $80 million of that. And then just on the prior question from Ali, if there are to be proceeds from transactions that might happen later this year, the primary place for that to go would be the transmission spend. Michael Lapides : Yes. And I\u2019m just thinking outside of transactions, because that\u2019s kind of bigger dollars versus where I am focused here. I didn\u2019t know if you are making another increase to expected transmission spend, given a strong first quarter 2015, similar to like what you did in the first quarter of 2014. Brian Tierney : Not at this point. Nick Akins : Not at this point. Michael Lapides : Yes. Nick Akins : But just know that we continue to advance our transmission spend. And if conditions wind up that way, we will be happy to do it. Michael Lapides : Got it. And because when I start looking, Brian, at the balance sheet and your capitalization ratios, they\u2019re getting pretty healthy. They\u2019ve been getting healthy for the last couple of years. But they are now reaching \u2013 I think your FFO to debt is, on a percentage wise, getting at or even better than some of your targets. Just curious about when the health of the balance sheet, regardless of having had such a strong first quarter, enables you to deploy more capital in the transmission maybe a little bit earlier than you thought. Brian Tierney : Yes, so very good point there, Michael. I think the CapEx that we spent last year, the 4.4 that we spent this year, were predicated on those improving credit metrics. Again, if we were to change the portfolio of businesses that we have, we think we would have even more balance sheet capacity. I think you saw Duke get an upgrade on the sale of its competitive generation business. We would expect a similar actions by the rating agencies if we were to transact going forward, which would give us even more balance sheet capacity. And if and when those things happen, you know where we\u2019re going to be spending those dollars. It\u2019s going to be on that transmission growth story that we have going on. Michael Lapides : Got it. Last question, just thinking about transmission. We\u2019ve seen some changes come out of the FERC regarding transmission ROEs. We\u2019ve seen a multitude of cases in other RTOs in the Midwest ISO and in ISO New England. We have not seen a lot of activity regarding that in PJM. Just curious for your view on kind of why PJM is one of the few regions where we haven\u2019t seen a lot of Section 206-type cases for ROEs. Nick Akins : I think you haven\u2019t seen the ROEs out of the realm of reasonableness. So there\u2019s a bandwidth for that. And certainly, I see FERC continuing to encourage the investment in transmission. And so, you see some of these one-off type of cases. And they have their own situations, whether it\u2019s their RTO premium, that kind of thing. And when you look at the aggregated total from a ROE perspective, we\u2019re still within the range of reasonableness, comfortably. So we don\u2019t expect much change, from our perspective. Michael Lapides : Got it. Thank you, guys. Much appreciated. Betty Jo Rozsa : Operator, we have time for one more question. Operator : Thank you. That will come from Angie Storozynski with Macquarie. Angie Storozynski : Thank you very much. So I have two questions again, about the merchant power business. Just so we\u2019re clear, assuming that the capacity auction clears at strong levels, would that be a bullish indicator for a possibility of PPAs in Ohio, in a sense that that would allow you guys to prove that those PPAs would be beneficial to rate payers? Nick Akins : Angie, you bring up a great point, and certainly one that we think about a lot. Because there\u2019s two sides to the equation that are working here. And as you talk about PJM and what FERC can do and the capacity auctions, if the capacity auctions improve considerably, then that may, in fact, have a negative impact on the ability for PPAs. And I am saying negative from our perspective, because the market is saying the value that capacity is going up considerably. So you look at what Ohio is doing. Ohio looks like a long-term PPA customer to us. And typically, long-term PPA customers will enter into contracts when prices are lower so that they can lock in value for customers in the future.  And my concern is, if the market continues to increase considerably, that we will be looking at investors saying, why are you entering into PPAs with a market going up considerably? And that will be a problem for us. So I think the Ohio Commission, and the state of Ohio, really needs to think about that, in terms of the long-term stability of Ohio and where it\u2019s placed in the right now. Because we\u2019ve demonstrated that the PPAs are a benefit to customers over the long term. And so a decision needs to be made. So to me, I think, in some cases, the race is on. And we have to get this resolved. Angie Storozynski : Okay. And secondly, assuming that you do sign those PPAs for 2,700 megawatts and that similar things happened for synergies assets and potentially other diversified utilities in the state. So how do you think those PPAs are going to impact the value of the remaining 5,000 megawatts that you will be planning to sell on a merchant basis? Nick Akins : Yes. So the units that are placed in the 2,700 megawatts, they are ones that are still fit well in the market, but they\u2019re probably the most at risk. And Ohio has to look at that from \u2013 we want to keep the generation. We want to keep it running. We want to keep the taxes, the jobs, but there is still a benefit to customers. So the other generation will continue to fit very well into the market. And then from the PPA perspective of generation fleet itself, if it is approved the way we presented it, with a long-term approach that\u2019s essentially life of plant and those kinds of things, it becomes somewhat neutral. Because you have a situation there where it is quasi regulated. So I think it could wind up being a really good fit, because you would have the certainty around a portion of the portfolio in Ohio. And then Ohio could still take advantage of any market fluctuations that may occur, just like we do with any other portfolio we have. There\u2019s a fixed portion. There\u2019s a variable portion. And I think that\u2019s ultimately best for customers, just like we do fuel. Angie Storozynski : Very good. Thank you. Nick Akins : Yes. Betty Jo Rozsa : Thank you for joining us on today\u2019s call. As always, the IR team will be available to answer any additional questions you may have. Brad, would you please give the replay information. Thank you. Operator : Thank you.

[Operator Instructions]. At this time I would like to turn the conference over to our host, Managing Director of Investor Relations Betty Jo Rozsa. Please go ahead. Betty Jo Rosza : Thank you Nick. Good morning everyone and welcome to the second quarter 2015 earnings call for American Electric Power. We're glad that you were able to join us today. Our earnings release, presentation slides and related financial information are available on our website at AEP.com. Today we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors. Joining us this morning for opening remarks are Nick Akins, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and Brian Tierney, our Chief Financial Officer. We will take your questions following their remarks. I will now turn the call over to Nick. Nicholas Akins : Thanks Betty Jo. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining AEP's second-quarter 2015 earnings call. AEP once again had a strong quarter performance. At the risk of being redundant there are several reasons for this positive performance. The strength of geographic and state jurisdictional diversity, the passion and culture of AEP employees to continue our journey of efficiency gains through lean optimization activities, positive regulatory outcomes through our focus on operating company performance, continued expansion of our transmission business, increases in all three customer segments; residential, commercial and industrial; and continued positive performance by the unregulated business despite lower than forecasted power prices. These results continue to illustrate the disciplined execution of our business segments to produce consistent earnings performance for our shareholders. That's what is expected from the next premium regulated utility, our tagline at last year's EEEI financial conference. The second quarter GAAP and operating earnings came in at $0.88 per share, compared with second-quarter 2014 GAAP and operating earnings of $0.80 per share. For year-to-date with the positive performance of the first quarter as well, AEP's earnings stands at GAAP $2.16 per share and operating earnings at $2.15 per share. As you already know, two days ago the board of AEP authorized dividends to be paid to shareholders of $0.53 per share making this the 421st consecutive quarter of dividends being paid in the history of AEP. It was Plato who said, there is no harm in repeating a good thing. So in light of that, as we did last year, we are raising our guidance for 2015 from $3.40 to $3.60 per share to $3.50 to $3.65 per share and increasing our capital spend and transmission another $200 million from $4.4 billion to $4.6 billion. We are also reaffirming our 4% to 6% earnings-per-share growth rate based upon our original guidance. 2015 is stacking up so far to be another great year for AEP, but we still have 1/2 a year to go. We aren't popping the champagne corks or anything like that. But we are leaving the second quarter with a smile of quiet confidence as we enter the second half of 2015. As we have maintained for the last two years, 2016 is a significantly challenged year because of Ohio issues of deregulation and capacity auctions, but we have and continue to chip away at the deficit because of actions taken to continue our expected earnings growth profile. Let me address a few areas before Brian takes over with the details. While customer load remains somewhat tenuous if you're looking quarter to quarter, during the second quarter all three customer classes, residential, industrial and commercial, increased; particularly commercial load. Continued industrial growth is interesting given it's primarily driven by the oil and gas sector. We usually hear of new rig counts decreasing but that doesn't necessarily translate to load decreases, however. We continued to see production and load increasing in the shale regions primarily due to continued optimizations of the oil and gas fields including the additions of compressor load. While overall load increases have been slightly less than forecast, the mix between customer classes continues to impact financial outcomes. We will continue to watch the load sectors closely as we gauge the robustness of any potential overall economic recovery. We continue to be pleased with the progress of our continuous improvement and cultural aid initiatives through Lean and our Power Up and Lead programs that enable a culture and an expectation of continuous efficiency improvements, with decisions made as teams in all levels of the organization. Regarding Lean activities, we are now complete with 15 plants, with one remaining and have extended into areas such as Cook Nuclear Plant and centralized repair shops as well. We've completed 20 of 31 distribution districts with 10 remaining for this year and one that will extend into the first quarter of 2016. Three of five transmission areas across the AEP have completed Lean reviews, with the remaining anticipated to complete by the end of the year. Additionally Lean activities are in progress in other areas such as IT, supply chain, inventory management, fleet operations, customer and distribution services and others. This activity has and will continue to be a very important part in engaging our employees to achieve not only our 2016 objectives but also to redesign our business processes and supporting culture for the future. Starting with the rate case activities, we have completed cases at APCO in West Virginia and in Kentucky. We also initiated rate case at PSO in Oklahoma. The West Virginia rate case outcome met our expectations of improved revenues to support the quality of service to our customers and improvement in the recurrent expectations with investments made at APCO. The order authorized an increase in rate with an ROE of 9.75% with additional revenues for vegetation management, confirmation of the base rate transfer of the Mitchell plant, resolution of the consolidated tax issue, among other areas that really set a positive tone for the future. Regarding Kentucky, the rate case outcome there again was constructive for future investments. The $45 million rate increase authorized included 10.25% ROE for several riders regarding certain Mitchell and Big Sandy activities including incremental vegetation management. Also importantly, it allowed the recovery of North Zip compliance costs, signaling the recognition by the commission of the importance of these types of expenditures. It also settled the issues related to the fuel cost recovery case that was before the court. While with these two cases completed along with the formula base rate adjustments at I&M and SWEPCO we have now secured the forecasted rate changes for 2015. Additionally we filed a base rate case at PSO to recover generation and environmental related costs, as well as other cost adjustments with the request of 10.5% ROE. Rates in that case are intended to be effective in first quarter of 2016, so overall a great story regarding regulatory performance. As you all know by now, FERC had approved the capacity performance model that PJM had proposed and last night threw a wrench in the plans for at least a supplemental auction being held next week. But regardless, the upcoming base residual auction will ultimately help define the forward view of generation value. The supplemental auction remains important for our risk-adjusted 2016 performance. We'll be participating in all of these auctions, of course not saying how. But we are hopeful to see improvement in valuations of our generation. These auctions will affect the financial outlook for unregulated generation, in particular baseload generation and will begin to answer some of our 2016 risk-adjusted assumptions. More clarity on the subject will be provided when we get 2016 guidance at the EEI Financial Conference. The forward view of generation will also be an important data point as it relates to our evaluation process of the unregulated generation. The process continues with these instructive and perhaps substantial data points that we have been discussing with our board for a couple of years now. Chuck Zebula and his team have done an outstanding job compartmentalizing the risk of this business and are positioning the business in a positive way regardless of the outcome. PJM and FERC have done their jobs in at least making some progress in allowing for a potential path for improved generation value. The only holdout is the Public Utility Commission of Ohio on the PPA question. We would not have presented the PPA option through the Commission if we did not think it was important. It's important for Ohio and its energy policy, Ohio jobs, taxes, economic development and in fact, the future of the generation business in Ohio. Governor Kasich once give me some advice. Don't get so buried in the financial expectations of the company that you lose sight of doing the right thing. If we take a look back at AEP's proud history of owning and operating generation in Ohio, we have always supported the economic engine for growth whether it be the assets themselves, the ancillary assets such as transmission, the supported economic developed or the development of domestic Ohio fuel to support the generation. So what's happened in the last few years in Ohio? Well, for AEP over $0.5 billion in write-offs, the incremental loss of capacity revenue or approximately $200 million, each and every year in the last three years and a state that is left short of generation capacity to serve Ohio customers. Not a good story for generation investment in this state because we serve 11 state jurisdictions of almost all regulated jurisdictions as well as significant transmission across the country, we have managed the loss of Ohio revenue pretty well. That's the value of diversity. But this is really about the customers in the state of Ohio. It's about volatility of electric pricing, particularly in extreme heat or extreme cold that impacts all customers' pocketbooks. It's about Ohio's energy and financial future by developing its own resources such as natural gas and maintaining existing resources. Continual delays are not the answer. It's time for the PECO to do the right thing. Moving on to another subject, we continue to participate in the EPA dialogue regarding the clean power plan. We've talked at length in previous earnings calls about the challenges the proposed rule produces for the state utilities and other stakeholders so I will not cover that ground again. I will say that I believe through conversations at the White House and the EPA that there is an understanding of the major issues involved, namely the aggressive front-end 2020 emission targets and timeline and the reliability applications. What they ultimately do about it in the final rule we don't know. We will continue to work with our states to understand the final ruling implications and engage in the succeeding deliberations to achieve an ultimate result that is reasonable and rational and its impact on customers costs and reliability of supply while maintaining to achieve environmental progress. Let's turn to the next page. The famous equalizer graph, there is a couple of start things in the equalizer graph that I will get into here but from an Ohio power situation, the ROE for AEP Ohio decreased this quarter primarily due to lower earnings driven by increased PJM and property tax costs and lower margins due to seasonal rate adjustments. However we do expect the AEP Ohio subsidiary will finish the year in line with the 12% ROE forecasted. For APCO you just heard about the rate case in West Virginia and the outcome there. So rates were implemented in June or 2015, so we expect to see higher ROEs for APCO for the balance of the year and that will continue to improve. The primary drivers - and Kentucky is one of those areas 0.6% does not look too good. But the primary drivers for the decrease in ROE were the $36 million regulatory provision that was reported for the fuel cost recovery disallowance related to Mitchell, plus an additional $7 million that was recorded in 2015. Also Off-System Sales have been off slightly in Kentucky as well, but we expect the ROE will grow to approximately 5% by the end of 2015 and should be in the 9%-10% range by the end of 2016. We should see a measurable progress here in the next year and a half. I&M continues to do well. It's on track to grow earnings and achieve its authorized ROE range. They are in the middle of several capital investment programs particularly in generation with Rockport SCR, solar installations, nuclear lifecycle management and its well transmission projects, so we continue to see that one improve. PSO did improve modestly as a result of higher retail margins primarily on increased rider revenues and lower O&M expenses. A base rate case, I mentioned earlier, has - had been filed July 1, 2015, so we expect continued recovery there as well. And SWEPCO, the transmission cost recovery in Texas and a formula-based rate true-up in Louisiana as well as a true-up in increased wholesale customer rates were the primary drivers for SWEPCO's ROE improvement during the second quarter. However the ROE continues to be under pressure because of the Arkansas portion of TERC and we continue to analyze our alternatives and timing associated with addressing the 88 megawatts of TERC that are still outstanding. AEP Texas we expect the ROE&A there to continue to decline somewhat through 2015 as distribution has raised their CapEx and the need to infuse equity to replace tax obligations due to related deferred taxes from the securitization. The AEP Transmission Hold Co. is doing well. Its Hold Co. returned 11.9% is still in line with its authorized return so it continues to do well. So from an equalizer standpoint the numbers are reasonable. The overall has come up, it will continue to come up and Kentucky which is the one that is showing extremely low, will make rapid progress so we're in good shape there. The transformation of our industry is occurring. AEP will continue to position itself to succeed. If I could borrow from Jim Collins, the famous business author, of Good to Great, Great by Choice and other books, what our investors have witnessed over each quarter of the last four years has been the beginning of AEP's version of the 20 mile march. With dogged determination, disciplined execution and AEP ingenuity, we will be successful as the next premium regulated utility. Brian, I will turn it over to you. Brian Tierney : Thank you Nick and good morning everyone. Let's begin on slide 5 with a review of the major drivers affecting the earnings comparison for the quarter. This year's second quarter operating earnings were $0.88 per share or $429 million compared to $0.80 per share or $390 million last year. This solid performance for the company was driven by our regulated businesses where we are investing for our customers, executing on our regulatory plans and spending O&M wisely. With that overview let's review the major earnings drivers by segment. Earnings per share for the vertically integrated utilities segment was $0.43, up $0.12 from last year. Key drivers in the quarterly comparison include rate changes which added $0.11 per share and are related to the recovery of incremental investment to serve our customer. This improvement includes the effect of annual true-ups related to FERC formula rate customers. Warmer temperatures in 2015 and higher normalized margins each added $0.01 per share to the quarter versus last year. The growth in normalized sales is primarily driven by improvements in the commercial class. I'll talk more about load and the economy in a few minutes. The vertically integrated segment also benefited from lower O&M expense, adding $0.02 per share for the quarter. Partially offsetting these favorable items is a $0.03 per share decline in off system sales margin which was driven by much lower power prices this year. The transmission and distribution utilities segment earned $0.16 per share for the quarter, down $0.02 from last year. The $0.02 per share decline in normalized margins is due in part to the elimination of seasonal rates in Ohio beginning in 2015. This will reverse over the balance of the year. This segment was also adversely affected by $0.01 per share from higher O&M expense primarily due to higher transmission costs in Ohio. These two unfavorable items were partially mitigated by earnings on incremental. investment and distribution facilities to benefit customers in Ohio. The Transmission Hold Co. segment continues to grow, contributing $0.13 per share for the quarter, an increase of $0.03 per share over last year. Year-over-year the Transco's net plant grew by approximately $1.2 billion, an increase of 57%. The generation and marketing segment produced earnings of $0.16 per share, off $0.04 from the second quarter of last year. As expected we're beginning to see the adverse effect of lower Ohio capacity revenue. You will remember our 2015 forecast included a capacity revenue decline of $0.35 for the year beginning in June. Despite this decline, the segment benefited from favorable hedging activity which helped offset the impact of weaker market prices. AEP River Operations declined $0.01 per share quarter over quarter, reflecting a decline in barge revenue due to high water conditions in May and June. Corporate and other earnings were unchanged from last year's results. On slide 6 we have a view of year-to-date operating earnings compared to last year. Operating earnings for the period end at $2.15 per share or $1.1 billion, compared to last year's $1.95 per share or $950 million. Similar to the quarterly comparison growth from our regulated businesses is driving results with the competitive businesses performing close to last year. Weather had no impact on the year-to-date comparison. Earnings per share for the vertically integrated utilities segment were $1.03 per share this year up $0.15 from last year. The major drivers for the segment include the favorable effect of rate changes for $0.15 and the effect of the Virginia rate legislation adding $0.03 per share. Remaining drivers were discussed at length during our first-quarter call; as a reminder these include lower normalized margins, primarily due to lower residential sales in the East, the effect of lower power prices this year on both our Off-System Sales margin net of chairing and PJM expenses and lower O&M this year primarily driven by a decline in employee-related expenses. The transmission and distribution utility segment earned $0.36 per share for the first six months, down $0.02 from 2014 consistent with the second quarter. We're on track to achieve the segment's earnings target for the year. The Transmission Hold Co. segment earnings through the first half of the year are at $0.21 per share, up $0.06 for the same period in 2014. Similar to the quarter, increased investment is driving the year-to-date results. The generation and marketing segment matched last results through the first half of the year. As I mentioned we're seeing the adverse effect of lower capacity revenue but our trading and retail activities have offset this impact. And finally AEP River Operations remains favorable for the first six months driven by lower cost in the first quarter. In summary when you look at our performance for the first half of 2015, you see our regulated utilities executing on their investment and rate recovery plans while demonstrating cost discipline with day-to-day operations. Our competitive businesses, despite being challenged by the decline in capacity revenue, have produced earnings at last year's level as the commercial and retail teams continue to take advantage of the available opportunities. This combination has allowed us to exceed last year's results by $0.20 per share. Strong results from the first half of the year and a stable outlook for the balance of the year serve as the basis for raising the operating earnings guidance range to $3.50 per share to $3.65 per share. Now let's look at slide 7 to review the normalized load performance for the quarter. Starting in the lower right corner, weather normalized load grew by 0.009% compared to last year. With growth spread across all our major retail classes. This brings our year-to-date normalized growth within 0.003% of last year's results through the second quarter. In the upper left quadrant residential sales are up 0.003% compared to the second quarter of 2014. The growth in residential sales is largely coming from customer growth which is also up 0.003%. Most of the customer growth is happening in our Western territory, especially Texas, where residential counts are up 1.2% versus last year. Year-to-date residential sales are down 2.2% versus last year; this is mostly a result of the weak normalized growth reported the first quarter. Remember that last year's first quarter normalized load was unusually impacted by the polar vortices. Looking to the upper right corner of the slide, commercial sales were up 1.9% for the quarter. Here we saw growth in commercial sales at every operating company except for Kentucky Power. Once again the strongest growth in the commercial sales is happening in the West, where we also saw the strongest growth in non-farm employment. Finally in the lower left quadrant, industrial sales growth moderated again from the previous two quarters but still grew by 0.006% compared to last year. We continued to see robust industrial sales growth from customers in oil and gas related sectors despite the recent decline in oil prices. Outside of the oil and gas sectors, our industrial sales were down 3.2% compared to last year. As many of our export manufacturing customers are starting to feel the impact of the strong dollar and weaker global demand. With that let's review the most recent economic data for AEP's service territory on slide 8. Starting with GDP you can see that the estimated 1.7% growth for AEP's service area is about 0.5% less than the estimated growth for the U.S. This is not surprising given the impact of falling oil prices, especially in our Western footprint. As you know, AEP's service territory covers five of the seven major shale areas that the EIA has noted are responsible for 95% of domestic oil production and all of natural gas production growth since 2011. While the entire nation benefits from lower fuel prices, the regional economies supporting these shale plays experience the direct impact of the lost oil and gas jobs in those areas. In fact this quarter marks the first time in over four years where AEP's Western GDP growth fell below that of the East. In the bottom left quadrant you can see that the job market within AEP's service area to improve in step with U.S. employment recovery. Here job growth within AEP's Western territory exceeds the Eastern service area. The sectors showing the strongest job growth for the quarter included construction, leisure and hospitality and education and health services. We should point out that the sector which saw the biggest decline this quarter is the natural resources and mining sector which is not surprising given the decline in oil prices and active rig counts. Now let's turn to slide 9 to update you on the domestic shale gas activity happening within AEP's footprint. We continue to see significant industrial load increases in the parts of our service area located in and around major shale formations as illustrated in the upper left chart. It's remarkable that we saw 10% growth in electricity sales to oil and gas related sectors despite oil prices that are down 45% from last year, rig counts being down nearly 60% and 8000 fewer oil and gas workers than we had at the end of 2014. In the upper right chart Oil and Gas loads spread across all major shale plays within AEP's service territory with the strongest growth located around the Woodford, Eagle Ford and Marcellus Shales. If we dissect the oil and gas growth into its components that is upstream, midstream and downstream activities, as shown in the bottom left chart, you see that the strongest growth is coming from the midstream pipeline transportation sector which grew by over 34% in the second quarter. This is mostly due to the expanding infrastructure being built in West Virginia, Ohio and Texas to support the Marcellus, Utica and Texas shales. In our upstream sector, oil and gas extraction, volumes are up nearly 6% while the downstream petroleum and coal products sector grew by just under 2% this quarter. I should point out that we expect a number of new oil and gas related expansions to come online over the next 18 months. In contrast to the growth in our oil and gas sectors, I'd like to focus your attention to the red bars on the upper left chart. This shows the trend in our industrial sales excluding the oil and gas related sectors. You can see that the rest of our manufacturing sales are not growing as they were last year at this point. Down 3.2% in the second quarter. In fact through June, 6 of our top 10 industrial sectors are down from last year's results. The only sectors showing growth are the three oil and gas related sectors along with transportation equipment manufacturing which benefits from low oil prices. The stronger dollar and weak global economy have developed into headwinds for many of our export manufacturing customers. For example, sales to chemical manufacturers were down almost 9% this quarter, while primary metals volumes were down 10%. This is something we will continue to monitor closely as we work through the balance of the year. On a lighter note, let's turn to slide 10 and review the company's capitalization and liquidity. Our debt to total capital is very healthy at 54.3%. Our credit metrics, FFO interest coverage and FFO to debt are solidly in the BBB and BAA1 range at 5.6 times and 21.5% respectively. Our qualified pension funding has improved and is now fully funded at 101%. This improvement was driven by our reduction in liabilities from increased interest rates which more than offset a small decline in pension assets. The company also made a $92.5 million contribution to pension assets in June, as planned which is equal to the company's estimated annual service costs. Since our OPEB funding stands at 122%, no funding will be needed in 2015. Finally our liquidity stands at $3.2 billion and is supported by our two revolving credit facilities that extend into the summers of 2017 and 2018. At this point I would like to point out some of the opportunities our Treasury group has taken advantage of during the quarter. First, at Appalachian Power Company, they redeemed a high coupon issuance and refinanced at a much lower market rate. Secondly the Treasury team extended to April 2017 the $500 million AEP generation resources term loan with a flexible lower-cost facility. And finally, the team partnered with local banks in the Indiana and Michigan service areas to grow that company's local bank facility to $200 million with an expiration in May of 2018. The company has worked very hard over the last several years to strengthen its balance sheet. As you just heard, our Treasury group is active in the debt markets and working with our banking partners to secure low-cost capital to put to work for our customers. This when combined with our strong operating results give us the confidence to increase our capital spend by $200 million this year. Let's see if we can wrap this up on slide 11. Clearly the first half of 2015 is off to a strong start for our customers, shareholders and employees. Conditions have been favorable and our operating commercial and corporate groups have made the most of the opportunities available to them. Based on our strong results to date and our outlook for the balance of the year, we're comfortable raising our operating earnings guidance range to between $3.50 per share and $3.65 per share. Based on our operating cash flows, our strong balance sheet, and our continued access to low-cost capital we're confident in increasing our capital investments this year by $200 million. This incremental spend will be in our transmission businesses, both at the Transmission Hold Co. and at our utility operating companies. And finally, we are reaffirming our 4% to 6% growth range. We have some challenges related to Ohio deregulation and an unsettled economy but we're managing our way through with disciplined O&M spending, the continuous improvement initiatives that Nick mentioned and increased investment in our regulated businesses. With that I'll turn the call over to the Operator for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question today comes from the line of Daniel Eggers with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Daniel Eggers : Nick, I know you cannot control the government and all regulators but certainly delays in Ohio and the [indiscernible] last night pushed that timeline the clarity on the generation business but can you walk through how you and the board are approaching a decision on monetization. What datapoint you guys think you need to see before you are comfortable formalizing that decision? Nicholas Akins : Dan, clearly we were looking at the capacity auctions to look at the long-term value generation. The supplemental auctions are by and large sum of the risk-adjusted items and filler in for 2016 and 17 during those years, but in particular 2016. If those supplemental auctions continue to occur before certainly before in September, October time for an even then we will have a good handle on what we 16 looks like. But the base residual auction is clearly the important one in terms of long-term valuation of generation and we continue to expect those valuations to improve. Our board has been along with us all along the way. As a matter fact we had a board meeting with them this week. And when over the issues involved and the primary issue was the upcoming auctions that would be a large part of presenting to us our options relative to the strategic valuation of generation. That is the key component. As far as the PPA is concerned that will continue on. It's really hard to tell when the pew co-will focus on that. I would say that we continue to push for the PPA obviously but the main determinant right now with the board is the capacity auction. Once we get that we will have a major data point for the board and we can continue our process of the strategic evaluation. Daniel Eggers : And on guidance and we're going into the summer but if you look at generation now above your full-year guidance and transmission and the run rate equals your full-year guidance, what are some of the things we should think about tempering the second half results to stay within this elevated band and how particular on some of the segments. Nicholas Akins : I think you have O&M spent obviously that there is timing issues with O& M. As far as the remaining they could be storm related activities, many things we hedge on. I know that sounds like sandbags to a certain point but it's not that. It's really we're trying to risk adjust some of these issues that can occur. Brian? Brian Tierney : Yet another big driver is that PJM capacity revenue declined $0.35 almost all that is in the back half of the year. Five cents of that was in second quarter but the remaining $0.30 is back half of the year. Daniel Eggers : I guess maybe, just the other way how much O&M do you think you can incrementally pull forward from '16 into '15 just to give you a little more breathing room for next year given some of the other built-in challenges there already? Nicholas Akins : We pulled some already the sequential beyond what we did last year. It's around 14 million. It's getting harder and harder to do that obviously. You can pull some input you cannot pull everything in. I'm seeing that as more limited right now. Operator : Thank you. Now we will go to the line of Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Stephen Byrd : I wanted to touch on transmission, you're making great progress in terms of incremental spend. I wondered if there were further opportunities that you saw or if you could maybe give us more color on the outlook there to create additional opportunities. What sort of - what are the drivers here as we should think about your ability to grow transmission even further. Nicholas Akins : There is a lot of color here. We have a lot of incremental spending that we can do in transmission. Right now transmission you think about it we have over 2000 projects going on right now. And those are small projects and larger projects in all that kind of thing. But it shows the bandwidth of what transmission is doing with look at the investment profile for transmission particularly for AEP in it continues to be - it's a huge footprint that we are able to invest in from Transco perspective and from an individual operating company perspective. We mentioned this last time. Just the rehabilitation of the existing grid we are challenged to keep up without that alone put an additional enhancements and we really want to do that because it improves the quality of service ultimately to our customers. And so we have a lot of runway left a lot to transmission. No question about it. Stephen Byrd : And switching back to clean power plant, after we see the final rule from EPA could you just talk about sort of the process overall. I know you\u2019ve a bunch of things to think through but how should we think about how you might respond over time in terms of what that will mean for your overall spending plan and how the grid will look and make the power plant etcetera. Can you talk at a high level as to how we should view that for you? Nicholas Akins : Sure. Obviously it depends upon what the final rule looks like. If you look at the categories - if you're having to adjust natural gas dispatch versus call dispatch example that is one thing. That ultimately impacts the fuel cost to customers. As a result when you do that kind of switching, but in terms of infrastructure, we've made the plan - our initial approach to this is going to be we get the final rule and if the EPA is fully aware of the issues involved from a reliability standpoint but also from a implementation standpoint and if they wind up being respectful to the state of the resource process that they go through and allow time for that to occur and targets are more rational instead of - 11 states have over 75% of the requirement in 2020 and many states there's over 50% of requirement in 2020. That has to change. It's too early and it is too aggressive emission reduction targets. If they come off of that and have a rational plan to allow technology to continue to improve and we can actually wind up at a better place at the end of the day in 2030 then that would be a good outcome. In that case we could be able to work with the state. They obviously care about what we think in terms of liability standpoint and the infrastructure that we put in place and how quickly we can do it and that kind of thing. But it is a state plans. And the states have to have time to review those plans and then we start taking actions based upon or our individual states want us to go. In my mind it depends upon certainly the president because the president is driving the bus on this thing. And the EPA obviously is looking at the issues - all the issues involved and if there is moderation associated with the targeted implementation and being respectful of the state process that need to occur and the infrastructure and timing of infrastructure and having reliability provisions that make sense, then we can get about the process of investing from an AP perspective. We're in the middle of a transformation anyway. The industry is in the middle of a transformation. We've already reduced our emissions by 15% since 2005. And that process continuing with the advent of natural gas shale gas activity in the advent of renewables putting in solar and doing wind farms, but energy efficiency and better technologies are coming into play as well. There are real opportunities for us to invest in the right things for the future and actually balance out our energy portfolio which is a good thing for this company and the country as a matter fact. Stephen Byrd : And assuming that again the EPA rule does give you a realistic path as you pointed out is that the past that is - you really couldn't achieve, should we be thinking about resource plan that can be filed and overall plans over time that you would submit that would be out how you see the best path forward and what that would involve in terms of spend an asset mix? Nicholas Akins : Yes that's right. We be working with the states to file the resource plans and then we was start the actions associated with it. This is a little different than the March reroll per customer approval was planned specific endpoint specific the new index we need to do. This it has got tentacles in many aspects of the electric utility business itself. And it will take some dialogue and serious dialogue and contemplation of how to address these types of issues to me state jurisdictional perspective. And will be a part of that process will follow our resource plan and we will go from there, just like we always have. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Steve Fleishman : You're for the couple times to the 2016 risk-adjusted assumptions. Could you just clarify exactly what you mean by that? Nicholas Akins : When you go into forecasting a year you are looking at what loads doing and obviously load is moving around on us. The customer mix is moving around on us. Capacity auctions were contemplated whether PPA would occur during that period of time and then of course looking at any transmission investment and those kinds of things that we need to evaluate. Those are important pieces but I think probably [indiscernible] thing we can do is come up with a plan and budget that risk-adjusted many of these items and some of them are externally driven. Significantly externally driven like the capacity auctions and the PPAs approach in Ohio. So as we go forward in the year, we obviously like to get more information that we can make - really make a quality forecast of what 2016 looks like. I think made a lot of progress. Because we know what we've done relative to the continuous improvement enhancements that have occurred that crescendo over time. And we expect that in our benefit in 2016. These external items are more difficult to tell and really what happened last night is another indication of how things can get adjusted at the last minute. So it's difficult to scale but I think in the next two 22 to 3 months we will see a lot of clarity. Brian Tierney : And even with all those factors that make mentioned, Steve, as with that we 16 we're still into the operating earnings guidance range that we\u2019ve given for that previously of $3.45 to $3.85 per share. Steve Fleishman : Okay. As part of this trying to judge how much you need to manage cost and move stuff around depending on how these play out? Is that also what currently you're referring to? Nicholas Akins : Yes absolutely. We've been moving costs from 2016 into 2015 and 2014. And now we're reaching the point of conclusion where we understand those cost components going into the year. It really is about load forecast and ladies external issues that we are doing with. But those will play themselves out in the next couple of months. Steve Fleishman : Okay. And maybe this is a bit of a commentary in the question but just I know you continue to focus very much on the auction outcomes and maybe a lesser extent PPAs in Ohio for the decision on generation. But there are a lot of other things that affect the value of the portfolio commodity prices, stock market, financing conditions, all those kinds of things. How much do you need - how are you weighing kind of answers to some of these questions versus just there can be periods of time where it's hard to get transactions done. Nicholas Akins : Obviously the answer is rate environment. We continue to deal with and certainly with Janet Yellen is trying to do with interest rates in the future. Might have an impact but as far as the sector itself and our performance within that sector, we feel very good about the past that we're taking and that is to take risks out of our business. And to make sure that we are able to invest in those things that provide quality returns to our shareholders. And. That is what we control. And we have to be very disciplined at it and there may be external things that occur around the world or nationally that could impact it but typically though even if you look at commodity prices I think where we're at right now is somewhat of a tenuous economy because we see residential commercial and industrial moving back and forth all during the year. It's like you're in a waiting stage. Who knows what will happen but you could have and energy economy take off or you could have an energy economy that stagnates but these based on public policy whether you exporting or we two other things. It would have an impact on the commodities themselves. And I think it's important for us to be knowledgeable about those kinds of issues so that we can manage our business around aggressiveness met shoulders consistent returns. And that's what we're doing. Steve Fleishman : Last question, the page with the credit metrics particularly the FFO to debt or the EBITDA metrics clearly shows you are way stronger than your targets. Can you give some thought on what's the ultimate goal? I assume your goal is not to stay dramatically above the targets. Nicholas Akins : It's to be within those targets, Steve. Part of that rationale is why we increased the CapEx for the balance of the year and of course will be looking at what we expect those metrics to be in 2016. And adjusting our apex forecast accordingly. Brian Tierney : A lot of this is about making sure that the business is on firm and sound financial footing so that we can make continual judgments about where he put our capital. And we have this huge hedge out there called transmission that we are able to essentially do acquisitions all-time. And it's a good place to be but at the same time we improved our currency value we improved our position from a risk tolerance perspective. And it is an opportunity for us to reposition this company for the future. We just retired 3500 MW of coal-fired generation. So you are starting to see a rebalancing of the portfolio to address what customers truly want in terms of resources we believe a balanced set of resources is important including cold but we've got to get through the process of ensuring that we're advancing from the other technologies and addressing customers concerns relative to quality of service and that's what we're doing. Operator : Thank you. We will now go to the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc Paul Ridzon : The 200 million of incremental transmission capital, how is that going to be divided between holdco and the utilities? Brian Tierney : About $80 million of that will go to the Transco and remainder will go to the integrated utility operating companies. Paul Ridzon : Could you give more flavor as to what went better than planned to allow you to raise guidance at this point in the year? Nicholas Akins : I think we covered that during the meat of the call to a large degree. Rate increases and whether were stronger than what we had forecasted. The regulated businesses are doing very well and the competitive businesses are doing about as well as last year. Cash flow is ahead of expectation and you put all of those things together in that gives us the confidence to raise the operating earnings guidance and raise the CapEx that we talked about Brian Tierney : And the continuous improvement activities, they are starting to culminate across the Board. So it's cost control, it's certainly the underlying fundamentals of the business are very positive and it gives us the confidence to raise the earnings. Operator : Next we will go to the line of [indiscernible] Unidentified Analyst : Can you talk about the scale of the open position at AEP generation resources as you look out over the next few years or how to think about that as a sensitivity? Nicholas Akins : They are trying to stay in a hedged position of about 60% -70%. I think they've done that to pretty good effect really since early last year when the business started. And that allows them to do a couple things. Allows them to hedge in what some of the earnings are going to be at prices that they find attractive and they do that through both retail - they also auction they have to serve FFO vote and their normal trading activity. But then it also leads them with an open position to take advantage of what could be higher prices like they have during the Polar Vortex sees of last year. Take advantage of that. And to cover things like unit outages or load spikes or price spikes that can happen in the short term. They don't want to be sold out and fully committed. They want to have a significant portion hedged and a portion to cover from on expected short-term opportunities Brian Tierney : Chuck and his team continually evaluate that but the 60 to 70% has been a target for a very long time now. It's for that reason - we are risk-averse from that standpoint because that business is really focused on making sure it continues to be an airtight business that has like I said earlier, Easton a great job of compartment slicing the risk. And that is a part of that ability for them to do that. Nicholas Akins : The assets that Chuck has in that business are great assets and the risk management they've applied to that is this has been phenomenal through some really pretty volatile circumstances over the last year and half. We really proud of the way they are managing that business and they've done it very to good effect financially. Brian Tierney : Really when we look at it's not internally what the issues are because we can control what happens all to have Power Generation operates from operational excellence perspective. And how we manage risk within that envelope. The real issue is what happens outside with the regulatory commissions, FERC, Ohio and elsewhere. But certainly yesterday was another indication. Markets moving toward a certain set of conditions for the auction and it gets changed at the 11th hour and that is a concern because you never know what the rules of the game are and they can change at the last minute or change afterwards. And that is troubling. I think consistency - we have consistency internally. It's consistency externally that we need. Unidentified Analyst : Is it presents us to say that you are bullish about power prices? Nicholas Akins : I wouldn't say that's presumptuous. I really believe we have taken substantial amount of capacity that's been retired and we believe that capacity prices will improve. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Jonathan Arnold : Any update on the River Ops transaction that you talked about last quarter? Nicholas Akins : The process we're going through terms of valuation continues. That's really all that we can report at this point. Operator : And we will now go to the line of Paul Fremont with Nexus. Your line is open. Paul Fremont : I guess I wanted to follow up on the PECO [ph] decision yesterday to get further consideration at some point in the future of your rehearing request in the [indiscernible] proceeding. Nicholas Akins : It just looks like it is some continued delay really. We don't seem to be getting answers or schedules or the things we need to be able to get the answers we're looking for. They seem to be putting some of the decisions further out into the future and as Nick said we need some clarity and we don't seem to be getting it. Brian Tierney : I don\u2019t know far you can delay these things. It's an issue where there needs to be an answer and I'm just concerned that we are either waiting until after the capacity auctions or whatever. Ohio needs to be concerned about - yesterday was another indication if you're going to depend upon from the federal side to address the market issues that changes will occur that you didn't - you may not anticipate. And I think from a generation perspective we've got to make sure that Ohio continues to develop and certainly with the natural gas out there that nothing will happen until there is some resolution so you're in a hold pattern. We're not going to make any investments in central station generation in Ohio. I have not seen many others step up to the plate. I know there's maybe one or two units that are being built out there but keep in mind you've retired thousands and thousands of megawatts and you're short in Ohio. And so the delays need to come to an end. Operator : Thank you. We will now go to the line of Brian Chin with Merrill Lynch. Brian Chin : Just a brief one on your earlier balance sheet comments, clearly the metrics are looking a little better debt to cap numbers of strategy around and even the pension funding numbers looked really solid. Given all of that does it make sense on the margin to reconsider capital deployment towards maybe looking at the dividend policy as opposed to truly looking at transmission CapEx? And marginal changes there to think about? Nicholas Akins : The real question is what happens to the dividend. Brian Tierney : In so many words, yes. Nicholas Akins : Yes. Usually we review the dividend policy in the October timeframe and our board certainly will be considering the dividend policy. We still maintain our 60% to 70% range we stated earlier and the dividend will be commensurate with the earnings profile looks like. We stand by that. There's no reason to see it will change but obviously we look at the baseline of the business and with the forward long-term view would looks like and the board will reevaluate and do that in October timeframe. Operator : Thank you. We will go to the line of Anthony Crowdell with Jefferies. Anthony Crowdell : I guess this is a softball question. Do you think Governor Kasich entering into the race slows decisions down in Ohio? It looks like [indiscernible] with the endgame is where they are looking to punch you but do you think this slows things down or speeds things up or has no impact? Nicholas Akins : My bet would be no impact because Governor. Kasich obviously has confidence in the commission and certainly Andre Porter is chairman has taken over there and my belief is that he is going to leave it to the commission to decide what this Ohio policy looks like. I don't see his running for office of the president to slow things down. I guess the real question is will the PCO actually speed up? That is something that they need to address. Anthony Crowdell : Do think they are waiting for - Brian had used that football metaphor for they keep punting. Are they punting to a certain calendar date or a certain time whether it's PGM is resolved or is that their target or is not really sure? Nicholas Akins : Only they can answer that. It's one thing to have one delay but to have delays of several cases occurring, that's really not a good message. And to said energy policy in the state, you've got to have the courage to step up and make a decision. Brian Tierney : And see them score touchdown or field goal rather than punt again. Operator : We will now go to the line of Ali Agha with SunTrust. Ali Agha : I just wanted to make sure I heard your original commentary correctly, with regards to your thinking on the generation business. So as you said these Ohio PPA [indiscernible] most likely now we\u2019re looking at that maybe in 2016. But if I'm hearing you right should we still expect your final decision on the merchant business this year in the remaining months of this year? Or is that also going to be dependent on when this PPA rider stuff now comes out? Nicholas Akins : I think certainly the capacity performance and the base residual auctions are significant piece of that discussion. We're going to have to see - what the lay of the land is after that is concluded to visit with our board and determine what the next steps are. But that doesn't stop us from pushing ahead with the PPA proposals regardless of the outcome. But certainly I think Ohio could send a great message by proving those PPAs. It remains to be seen whether we're going to actually wait. This can't go on for a long time. We're after certainty for our investors and from a shelter perspective, we cannot have this overhang because it really not only confuses us on how to invest in the unregulated generation or lack of investment, but it also is so convoluted that it is difficult to understand exactly what it is you have in terms of valuation of that generation. And so the steps being taken particularly with the clean power plan and other things that are occurring I think those units will survive the clean power plan because there absolutely needed. They are great units and they are 2/3.1/3 gas. A lot of fuel switching occurs between coal and gas. So they are valuable units but they just need to be reflected that way. I just think it's something we've got to get a handle on. As far as timing is concerned, we want to make that decision as quickly as we possibly can. But we have to do what is right for the shareholders and we have to do on analysis based upon what we can determine the best we can with the value of that generation on the forward basis will be. If you get a great capacity performance number, then that may diminish the need for PPA. But I still think PPA is needed. It's an important part of the hedging for customers in Ohio. It's important part of that generation being maintained in Ohio with the jobs taxes and everything else I've talked about. We're not going to - we have not and will not give up on the PPA approach with the commission. They need to answer that question. It would be great if the answered it relatively quickly so we can get on with the business at hand. But certainly those two items are still outstanding and we're hopeful that at least one of them will get resolved very quickly, so that we can start filling in the blanks. Ali Agha : And from a logistics point of view, Nick, there would be no constraint for you to exit the merchant business while this PPA rider application was still outstanding ask Nicholas Akins : We don't believe there is a constraint because the real value of the PPA is again to maintain the generation in Ohio and make sure that economically there is still there and regardless of the outcome of the disposition of that business. Ali Agha : And last question, is it fair to assume that previously you had looked at scale and spin off as two trajectories. Is still look a little more likely outcome than spin off? Is that fair to say? Nicholas Akins : We don't know that yet. We've all these events look at things like the tax efficiency and other parameters before we can really make a decision on sale versus spin. Or for that matter keep but certainly sale and spin which you mentioned. Those are areas where we have to look at the economics and it depends on - you've got to be offered a sale price that overcomes the tax efficiency of the spin and there is other things involved with it from a business perspective as well. I would say both are still part of the decision process. Operator : Thank you. And we will go to the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: A quick question if you look at all and get some clarity around transmission spending, [indiscernible] has been The gems been evaluating reduction in the forecast but from what I understand you are investing below the [indiscernible] level as in its basic transmission investments at the lower KV. How do think about the impact of potential reduction in PJM load forecast relative to your investment plans near term and long term it's actually in the context of having more proceeds from any prospective sale of the River Ops or [indiscernible] etcetera. Nicholas Akins : I don't anyone knows what the load forecast is at this point and certainly we don't know the level of investment needed from a transmission perspective. We are in the process of redefining this electric grid. And we have retirements that occurred on one of the transmission has been built because of the retirements but also there continues to be optimization across the grid as a result of their will be more optimization after the clean power plan gets resolved. The changes occurring in PJM now are more about generation and certainly reliability and less so about load. And so I wouldn't put much context in terms of a forward-looking transmission plant. We've seen over and over how transmission plans change with varying degrees and sometimes we get irritated by that because we plan transmission like PATH and things happen. But if you look at the underlying fundamentals of transmission, the grids is changing dramatically. The flows on the grid are going to change dramatically. So when you look at the four power transmission system you can be bullish about that and then the underlying which you mentioned the lower KV levels be some transmission and those levels, there is a massive amounts of rehab work and follow-up work to forward purchasers and at least be done. And we happen to have the largest transmission system in the country so that bodes well for the investment potential for AEP. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Perhaps just to clarify if you will, in the increase in transmission spend off late and just thinking about the sensitivity if there were to be a shift in the RTEP [ph], it seems that you guys have historically had some element of comfort around projections given that they don't primarily seem to flow out of the [indiscernible] process, if you could elaborate a little bit. Just getting some sense of how hedged are you presently to changes either way in RTEP. Nicholas Akins : We have a bunch of big buckets and a lot of those big buckets are not RTO dependent. Brian Tierney : Our transmission spend and forecast is not dependent on a RTEP load forecast. I would not put a lot of stock in a RTEP load forecast anyway. Operator : We will go now to the line of [indiscernible]. Unidentified Analyst : Couple of ones, first one with the transmission auction have you guys heard from PJM or do you guys have any idea when the new schedule might be or when we might get more information on that? Nicholas Akins : Yes we will know soon. I think certainly PJM will have to speak about the ins and outs of that but we suspect it will be within maybe a month or three weeks delay or something like that. I don't think it's a substantial thing. Still have to observe the same performance criteria when they did in. I think it should be a large delay. Unidentified Analyst : If it might be before the PRA? Nicholas Akins : I don't know about that. They will have to answer that obviously but I don't think we're talking about moving into fourth quarter or anything. Unidentified Analyst : Let's hope not, just another quick one for you. In terms of the potential asset sale or spend which you guys be open to idea of accepting other entities currency like a stock deal? I'm sorry guys would prefer cash if short sell the Junco would you guys be open to the idea of maybe taking the equity of whatever one of the players out there that has been acquiring these things? Nicholas Akins : Paul, at this point is worth evaluating. I think everything would be on the table. We wouldn't say no to that if we felt that was the highest value for our shareholders. Brian Tierney : I think we haven't closed off on any of these parameters that we keep talking about because frankly we don't have the full answers yet. Unidentified Analyst : On the delays that have been happening in Ohio etcetera, have you sensed any change in tone or issues that have come up or any flavor as to the environment there with respect to this? Or is this regulatory stuff that happens in a lot of major proceedings that are not exactly run-of-the-mill? Nicholas Akins : Obviously the PUCO I speak for supplement issue but it is a major issue. You can't get around that. I'm sure there's a lot of deliberations occurring over in their camp and it's part of the regulatory process. Many times I think it support for policymakers to understand the business disruptions that occur relative to either waiting for decisions or not making decisions let alone the wrong decisions. We really do need some consistency and delivering on orders and rulings on a timely basis. I think it's particularly important to the industry and particularly important to electric utilities in Ohio. Unidentified Analyst : Okay but you have noticed a significant shift I guess or any change in what's going on there other than normal back-and-forth and what have you? Or have you? Nicholas Akins : I don't think there's been a significant shift or anything. I think there's a lot of dialogue going on. We have dialogue going on these issues in the Ohio business Roundtable and the close partnership and of course at the commission as well. It is an important issue but I haven't sensed a change. I think it's a very deliberative approach. Operator : The final question will then come from the line of [indiscernible]. Unidentified Analyst : We have touched a lot on PGM and PPA. Fix it over to transmission back again. Could you talk about what you guys are thinking any update on potential alternative structures? I know last time you talked about the restructure doesn't make sense for you guys. Any updated thought process on that? And the second non-related question that could you talk about what you are - I know demand looked pretty good on normalized basis. Angel more insight into with respect to you see pattern to what you're seeing there are what sort of aside from just a general economy improving that striving the growth or demand improvement there? Nicholas Akins : Brian, covered the economy piece of it. As far as transmission is concerned we have in changed our approach to the transmission business we're still heavily investing in it and we still want to make sure that we continue to do it in a positive way from a state perspective. We haven't changed our approach from that perspective. Brian? Brian Tierney : I think on the customer usage side a large part of what is driving residential in particular is customer counts. We are seeing average customer usage hang in there. We're not seeing decreased to the degree some others are. But it is customer count that is driving it. I've been this job for five and half years maybe more and I've been talking about 5.3 million customers that whole time. I'm finally through to be able say we're rounding at 5.4 million customers. Customer counts particularly in the West helping us out. It's largely driven by is not the talk about macro factors but a lot of it is shale gas and with the economy are doing well. We are seeing increased usage. In places like Kentucky Power that is being particularly hard-hit by mining shutdowns in the like we're seeing customer counts decrease and used down. It really does unfortunately follow the macroeconomic factors that we are seeing and we are blessed to have the shale gas plays in our service areas and that's really driven a lot of the load increases that we've seen.

At this time, all lines are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, today\u2019s conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Bette Jo Rozsa. Please go ahead. Bette Jo Rozsa : Thank you, Cynthia. Good morning, everyone and welcome to the third quarter 2015 earnings call for American Electric Power. We are glad that you are able to join us today. Our earnings release, presentation slides and related financial information are available on our website at aep.com. Today, we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors. Joining me this morning for opening remarks are Nick Akins, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and Brian Tierney, our Chief Financial Officer. We will take your questions following their remarks. I will now turn the call over to Nick. Nick Akins : Thanks, Bette Jo. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining the AEP third quarter 2015 earnings call. Once again, AEP is reporting a strong quarter performance driven by the strength of our regulated utilities in our transmission business. And as a result, we are also increasing our 2015 guidance as well. For the third quarter 2015, AEP is reporting GAAP and operating earnings of $1.06 per share compared with $1.01 per share for third quarter 2014. This brings 2015 year-to-date GAAP and operating earnings to $3.22 per share and $3.21 per share respectively compared with 2014 year-to-date GAAP and operating earnings of $2.95 per share. With the positive quarterly and year-to-date results in hand, AEP is increasing our 2015 guidance range from $3.50 to $3.65 per share to $3.67 to $3.77 per share and reaffirming our 4% to 6% growth rate. As you already know the Board of AEP increased the dividend from $0.53 to $0.56 per share representing a 5.7% increase on annualized basis indicating once again confidence in the direction we are taking to become the next premium regulated utility, the tag line we used at last year\u2019s EEI Financial Conference. While load was also up in all three sectors, residential, commercial and industrial, the third quarter year-on-year, we continue to analyze the makeup of load and margins of each sector as Brian will discuss in more detail later. Our employees focused on continuous improvement and culture initiatives have been instrumental in not only achieving our earnings objectives, but redesigning our lines of businesses for future success. Lien activities continue to progress across the enterprise. This has been a three-year effort of what is now over 65 initial 3 to 4 months deployment efforts generating over 20,000 ideas from employees to improve efficiency and deliver better outcomes. We are in the process of finishing up the few remaining deployments and we will begin the process of ensuring the sustainability of the cultural and process-related changes that enable continuous improvement. This is because of primarily these efforts along with investment growth in the regulated companies and transmission as well as the outcomes from the PJM supplemental auctions that have improved our confidence regarding 2016, more to come on that in November, the EEI Financial Conference. As you know, we announced the sale of AEP River Operations to American Commercial lines for approximately $550 million plus the assumption of capital lease obligations of approximately $235 million. We are very pleased with the outcome from the process we began back in March to sell River Ops at a fair price to a company we truly believe understands what it takes to be successful on the River. AEP will receive about $400 million in net cash proceeds to invest in our regulated businesses. We have followed through the federal Hart-Scott-Rodino clearance and don\u2019t expect any delays. So, we should close in November. I do want to take the opportunity to recognize and thank the entire River Operations management and the operations team for their continued emphasis on providing value to AEP and its customers over the years. This sale represents a step towards the desired direction of delivering customer and shareholder value as a regulated utility company. The PPA story in Ohio continues to develop with ongoing hearings that are occurring and should conclude here very quickly. We don\u2019t know the outcome yet, but AEP is actively pursuing discussions with various parties in the case to ultimately drive to a solution that makes sense for AEP, its customers and other stakeholders. We believe the PUCO should be able to render a decision sometime before the end of the year. Because we believe the timeframe for decision is in hand, this will have a direct bearing on AEP\u2019s ultimate decision regarding long-term PPA coverage generation assets within our ongoing strategic evaluation process regarding the unregulated generation in Ohio. The PPA arrangements are important for the security of supply and pricing for Ohio customers and will provide an important segment regarding future investments in Ohio. We will complete our review with the Board as expeditiously as possible and as we deal with such issues that you all continue to ask about concerning strategic options, sale proceeds, user proceeds, potential dilutions, share buybacks, etcetera, fully expect not only the PPA decision, but the broader strategic decisions to be we answered in early 2016. AEP continues to work with each of our states regarding the clean power plant. We believe our state should follow initial plans with the EPA by September of next year to ensure the state maintains ownership and the development of resource plants that makes sense for their particular jurisdictions. AEP in the industry needs clarity regarding investment decisions in new resources and will continue to work with the space to develop integrated resource plans that comport with the requirements of these ultimate state plans. During the last quarter, you may have seen AEP\u2019s investment in Greensmith, an energy storage integration platform company and our continued development of utility-scale solar in Indiana and Michigan as well as our relationships with the universities to define energy solutions such as rooftop and utility-scale solar along with battery technologies. These investments in combination with our bold technology in transmission and other distributor-related investments will move us toward a cleaner, more balanced energy portfolio that is focused on the quality of service to our customers. You will hear more about this during the EEI in November as well. Now, moving to what I usually call the equalizer chart of ROEs by operating unit. Note that the overall ROE has improved to 9.4% from 9.1% from last quarter. As I go through the state, I will mention what\u2019s going on in each of one of those, so you can have some sort of a trim line on what to see in the future. For Ohio Power, the ROE for AEP Ohio is in line with expectations and we expect to finish the year in line with the 12% ROE forecasted. For APCO, Virginia earnings are expected to remain study during the period because of the previous legislation and the rate freezes in effect. For West Virginia, we had recently the rate case order that should address the weak returns there that was where our issue was and the APCO jurisdictions. The order authorized rate increase of 99 million with an authorized ROE of 9.75. Rates were implemented in June of 2015. So we expect to see higher ROEs for APCO for the balance of the year. Kentucky, I know that looks a little strange to you. We did know what to do when the return for the quarter was actually negative 0.1%. It almost looks like last year we probably should have just put the Kentucky investment into amateurs, but just understand that we did recently get through a rate case there and we expected to continue to improve. And that was part of the strategic decisions we made previously about what gets included in rate cases and the timing associated with them. So we expect Kentucky to move up to 4% by the end of the year. And then by mid-year, it will be \u2013 mid-year \u201816 it will be back in the 8% to 9% range. So, while we have this short-term probation of lower ROEs, we expect that to improve. For I&M, I&M continues to be on track to grow earnings and achieve its authorized ROE range, which is around 10.2%. I&M had a good third quarter as it continues to execute major capital investment programs in generation Rockport SCR, solar and the nuclear lifecycle management along with PJM transmission-related projects. PSO, its ROE is about the same as last quarter. And we continue to progress there through the rate case process. Base rate case was filed in July \u201815 to recover generation, environmental control investments and cost increases since the last base rate case. We expect new rates to be put in place by first quarter of 2016. SWEPCO transmission costs recovery in Texas in the form of the rate true-up in Louisiana as well as a true up and increase in wholesale customer rates were the primary drivers for SWEPCO ROE improvement. Although, we continue to see it under pressure, because of the Arkansas portion, what we believe is the Arkansas portion of Turk that we ultimately will be looking for in terms of a retail solution, but the timing has yet to be determined. For AEP Texas, we expect the ROE in AEP Texas will continue to decline through 2015 as the distribution CapEx increases are put in place. And we are looking \u2013 presently looking at alternatives for addressing the ROEs coming down in that jurisdiction either through distribution costs recovery or DCRF or rate case, but we are still looking at those options. AEP Transmission Holdco, its Holdco return of 11.3% is in line with the authorized return. So that keeps plugging along and we keep investing more and more in transmission. So with all that said, as we look at the accomplishments of the third quarter and year-to-date, it should be instructive as to what the future holds for AEP. I am reminded that yesterday, October 21, 2015, was Back to the Future Day, the day that Marty McFly and Dr. Emmett Brown Time Travel into the future from the 1989 sequel to back to the future. When we look back at 1989 and where we are today, during that time AEP has reduced SO2 emissions by over 80%, NOx emissions by over 80%, mercury emissions by over 54% and CO2 emissions since 2005 levels of 15%. More recently, we have deployed battery storage technologies, the bold transmission line, utility and rooftop solar, and now embark on the infrastructure of the future to define a better customer experience. These are all examples of back to the future\u2019s version of hoverboards and self-time sneakers, but all of this is to say that we believe AEP is uniquely positioned both financially and culturally to be successful during this huge transition that is occurring within our industry. We will continue to focus on infrastructure development, technology and resources of the future and a renewed focus on the customer experience. Our investors expect consistency in quality of earnings and dividend growth, so any decision we make should be viewed through the lens of being the next premium regulated utility. Now I will turn it over to Brian. Brian Tierney : Thank you, Nick and good morning everyone. Let\u2019s begin on Slide 5 with a review of the major drivers affecting the earnings comparison for the quarter. This year\u2019s third quarter operating earnings were $1.06 per share or $521 million compared to $1.01 per share or $493 million last year. This solid performance was driven by our regulated businesses, which were all at or above last year\u2019s prior results. With that background let\u2019s review the major earnings drivers by segment. Earnings per share for the Vertically Integrated Utilities segment were $0.56, up $0.11 from last year. Key drivers in the quarterly comparison included rate changes, which added $0.09 per share and are related to the recovery of incremental investment to serve our customers. Warmer temperatures in 2015 also contributed significantly to the earnings adding $0.07 per share. Cooling degree days were 25% higher in the east and 18% higher in our western service areas. Margins from normalized load were off $0.03 per share for the quarter due to lower residential sales and a slight decline in the average realization. Off system sales were down $0.03 per share primarily due to much lower power prices this year. O&M expense was higher than the prior period adversely affecting the quarter by $0.03 per share mostly due to the higher employee-related costs. This segment did benefit from higher AFUDC as a result of our capital spending program adding $0.01 per share and lower state and federal income taxes contributed $0.03. The Transmission and Distribution Utilities segment earned $0.23 per share for the quarter, up $0.04 from last year. The primary driver was an unfavorable regulatory provision recorded last year that was not repeated in 2015, which contributed $0.04 per share for the quarter. The remaining other variances were relatively small, including rate changes in Ohio and weather in Texas each adding a $0.01 versus last year and these are offset by lower off system sales and higher O&M. The Transmission Holdco segment contributed $0.09 per share for the quarter, up $3 million over last year. We remain on track to meet our guidance level for this segment for the year. Year-over-year, the Transco\u2019s net plant grew by approximately $1.2 billion, an increase of 51%. The generation and marketing segment produced earnings of $0.19 per share off $0.05 from the third quarter of last year. We are beginning to see the adverse effect of lower Ohio capacity revenue and earnings partially offset by lower O&M. AEP River Operations declined $0.01 per share and corporate and other lost $0.02 per share, down $0.04 from last year, primarily due to higher O&M and franchise taxes. On Slide 6, we have a view of year-to-date operating earnings compared to last year. Operating earnings for the year-to-date periods stand at $3.21 per share or $1.6 billion compared to last year\u2019s $2.95 per share or $1.4 billion. Similar to the quarterly comparison, growth from our regulated businesses are driving the improved results with the competitive businesses performing at or below last year. Consistent with our original guidance for 2015, our Vertically Integrated and Transmission Holdco segments are realizing strong growth driven by our continued capital investment in rate base and execution of our regulatory plans. Favorable weather also contributed to year-over-year earnings growth. As expected, we are seeing a decline in year-to-year earnings in our competitive generation business, reflecting the loss of capacity revenue, which was tempered by lower O&M and the performance of our commercial and retail teams taking advantage of market opportunities. The combination of all our businesses allowed us to exceed last year\u2019s results by $0.26 per share. These strong results and our confidence in our plan for the remainder of the year allow us to raise and narrow the operating earnings guidance range to $3.67 per share to $3.77 per share. Now, let\u2019s take a look at Slide 11 \u2013 I am sorry, it\u2019s Slide 7 to review the normalized load performance for the quarter. Starting in the lower right corner, you see that our load increased by 0.09% for the quarter with growth spread across all major retail classes. This brings our year-to-date normalized load in line with last year. The upper left quadrant shows that our residential sales grew by 0.08% compared to last year. The growth in residential sales is coming from a mix of customer and usage growth. Most of the customer growth is happening in our Western territory, especially Texas, where residential counts are up 1.2% versus last year. The growth in residential usage is coming from Ohio, where we saw the strongest growth in employment for the quarter. Year-to-date, residential sales are down 1.1% versus last year, but this is mostly caused by the weak normalized growth reported in the first quarter and remember that had the impacts from last year\u2019s Polar Vortex in that as well. In the upper right corner, commercial sales were up 1.3% for the quarter. The strongest growth in commercial sales happened in Ohio, which is consistent with the economic indicators we will discuss in more detail later. Finally, the lower left quadrant shows that our industrial sales grew at 0.07% compared to last year. We continue to see robust industrial sales growth from customers in oil and gas related sectors despite the decline in oil prices, which I will cover in more detail later in the presentation. I would like to point out that most of our load growth for the quarter and year-to-date period is coming from our T&D utilities segment where we only recovered the wires portion in our rates. Unfortunately, normalized sales are down 0.08% in our Vertically Integrated Utilities where we recovered the full bundled rate. This means even though our normalized load is similar to last year, we lost approximately $0.08 for the year due to the mix of our sales by segment and class. With that, let\u2019s review the most economic data for AEP service territory on Slide 8. Starting with GDP, you can see that the estimated 1.6% growth for the AEP service area is about 0.5% less than the estimated growth for the U.S. This is not surprising considering that the impact of falling oil prices, especially in our Western footprint. While the nation benefits from lower fuel prices, the regional economies supporting the shale plays are experiencing the direct impact of lost jobs. For example, there are number of metro areas like Shreveport, Tulsa and Abilene that have fewer people working today than they did at the start of the year. The bottom left quadrant shows that the job market within AEP\u2019s service area is holding steady, but grew at half the pace of the U.S. Job growth within AEP\u2019s Eastern territory exceeded the Western service area for the first time since 2011. The sectors showing the strongest job growth for the quarter include construction, leisure and hospitality and education and health services. We should point out that the sector which saw the biggest employment decline this quarter is natural resources and mining. This is no surprise given the decline in oil prices and active rig counts. Now let\u2019s turn to Slide 9 to update you on the domestic shale gas activity happening in AEP\u2019s footprint. Given the impact lower energy prices are having on a regional economy, one might expect our electricity sales to the oil and gas related sectors to be down. However, we continue to see significant load increases in the parts of our service area located near major shale formations as illustrated in the upper left chart. We are still seeing nearly 10% growth in our sales to the oil and gas sectors this quarter, despite oil prices being down 50% from last year, rig counts being down nearly 60% and the fact that there are over 10,000 fewer oil and gas workers today than we had at the end of last year. The upper right chart shows that growth in oil and gas loads were spread across all major shale plays within AEP service territory with the strongest growth coming from the Eagle Ford, Permian and Marcellus shale regions. If we dissect the oil and gas growth into its components, as shown in the bottom left chart, we continue to see the strongest growth from the midstream pipeline transportation sector, which grew by over 33% over last year. This was mostly due to the expanding natural gas infrastructure in West Virginia, Ohio and Texas. Our upstream oil and gas extraction sales were up nearly 8%, while downstream petroleum and coal product sales declined by eight-tenths of a percent. We still have a large number of new oil and gas related expansion expected to come online over the next 18 months that will drive our industrial sales growth through 2016. In contrast to the oil and gas sectors, the red bars in the upper left chart show the sales to the remaining industrial sectors are not growing as they were last year at this point, down 3.1% in the third quarter. In fact, through September, half of our top 10 industrial sectors were down from last year\u2019s results. One industry clearly affected by the low energy prices is the mining sector where sales were down 9% for the quarter and 8% for the year. On a lighter note, let\u2019s turn to Slide 10 and review the company\u2019s capitalization and liquidity. Our debt to total capital improved by nearly 1% this quarter and is now at a healthy 53.4%. Our credit metrics, FFO interest coverage and FFO to debt are solidly in the BBB and BAA1 range at 5.7 times and 21.6%, respectively. Our qualified pension funding declined a bit this quarter dropping from fully funded last quarter to 97% this quarter. This is a result of declining equity values and a slight decrease in interest rates. Our pension assets are now weighted to 60% in duration matching fixed income securities with the balance being held in global equity and alternative investments. We adopted this more conservative investment stance as we approach full funding late last year. Our OPEB obligations remain fully funded at 112%. Finally, our net liquidity stands at $3.6 billion and is supported by our two revolving credit facilities that extend into the summers of 2017 and 2018. Our treasury group was active during the quarter taking advantage of the low cost of that capital. First in August, Texas North accessed the market for a $125 million of senior private placement notes. The offering utilized that the late funding structure and realized the weighted average life of issuance of 13.4 years and a weighted average interest rate of 4.04%. Secondly, in September, the Treasury Group and Texas Central management accessed the market for $250 million of 10-year senior unsecured notes at a coupon rate of 3.85%. Over the past two years, the Treasury Group has been able to lower AEP\u2019s weighted average cost of debt to 4.64%. We are well positioned as we approach 2016, where we have a manageable debt maturity stack of slightly more than $1 billion. Finally, before we turn the call over to your questions, let me review on Slide 11 some of the information that we will be providing at the upcoming EEI Financial Conference. We will confirm our previously stated 4% to 6% growth rate, which assumes the sale of River Operations and the retention of the other businesses in AEP\u2019s portfolio. We will provide an updated operating earnings guidance range for 2016 with detail by segment. As in the past, our growth rate is predicated on our continued investment in our regulated properties. So, we will provide a capital expenditure plan for the next three years, details on transmission and utility investment opportunities, and a 3-year financing plan for getting it all done. We will also have some slides detailing our generation fleet transformation over the past several years as Nick just described. These slides will demonstrate how AEP has invested over $8 billion to transform the fleet and the resulting dramatic reductions and emissions that this investment has enabled. This story is becoming increasingly important to a certain class of investors and we believe AEP has a great story to tell. Finally, we will surely be talking about any developments in both the Ohio PPAs and the strategic review of our competitive generation business. With that preview for the future, let me now turn the call over to the operator for your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will go to Dan Eggers with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Dan Eggers : Hey, good morning guys. Nick Akins : Good morning, Dan. Dan Eggers : You guys made a great progress on the equalizer chart as far as improving the overall earned ROEs. How much more room we thought about \u201816 given the rate cases you see coming? Where do you see the \u201816 ROE headed and how much more improvement do you need in ROE to be able to hit the 4% to 6% growth rate? Nick Akins : Yes. I think it\u2019s going to continue to improve, Dan. We are probably on the order of 9.6% to 10% in that range for 2016. So, it will continue to improve overall. And then with Kentucky coming up, that\u2019s helpful, although Kentucky is pretty small in the overall comparison, but the others are doing quite well. Dan Eggers : Okay. And I guess preemptive on the Ohio generation side, but given the weakness of the power stocks in the IPP sector, is there a market of buyers still sitting out there who will be willing to transact on your assets right now or are market conditions potentially going to slow down maybe the year since you are making a decision on those assets? Nick Akins : Yes, I think there is still a set of bars out there. It\u2019s just \u2013 it certainly goes with the question whether spend option is \u2013 while it\u2019s still on the table, it\u2019s more difficult, because you have the paper involved with those companies, but for sale, there is still parties out there and some of the recent transactions have shown that. Dan Eggers : And I guess just one last question, when you guys look at the load trends going on right now, how was the residential versus commercial trends having there in which guys expect to see for load growth next year? Nick Akins : Yes. So, commercial continues to improve math like that\u2019s probably the bright spot of the portfolio. And you have these cycles that change as we go along in the residential. That\u2019s going up and down the last few quarters and it really does drive this view that we need the economy there really start picking up back, particularly from the energy policy perspective if we start exporting or if we continue a build out of the economy that\u2019s focused on energy than our economy will pickup as well. So we are getting some benefits from auto manufacturing and that kind of thing. But primary metals on the world market, mining those kinds of activities are certainly having an impact. So I mean we have been in sort of a strange period for several quarters and actually years now. And we obviously need to get the economy moving again from an energy perspective. Dan Eggers : Okay, got it. Thank you, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Nick Akins : Hi, Greg. Greg Gordon : Thanks. Good morning. Nick Akins : Good morning. Greg Gordon : Couple of questions, first the 4% to 6% earnings growth aspiration, is that still off the midpoint of the original 2014 guidance of $3.20 to $3.40 a share? Nick Akins : Yes, it is. Greg Gordon : Okay, great figures. You earned $3.43 in \u201814 and this year you are at the new midpoint you are going to earn $3.73 even if that weather normalize that, that\u2019s $3.65. So now withstand the deceleration in load growth trends that you are experiencing, one would presume you are doing very well relative to that aspiration. So I have to ask, does that aspiration build in the expectation that there will be some dilution from the sale of generation assets, which gets offset over time as you redeploy that capital into the transmission? Nick Akins : Go ahead, Brian. Brian Tierney : Greg that assumes the business as usual case that we continue to own the properties that we do today with the exception of river operations. And we will do for you at EEI like we do the normal waterfall stair step between 2015 and what we anticipate \u201816 to be. In addition to weather, which if you look across all our businesses is probably closer to $0.12. We have had things like inception gains at generation and marketing that are about $0.06. We have had the benefit from the sale of some plants and reducing ALO obligations that\u2019s another $0.06. So you can pretty easily do a stair step that would take off that $3.72 about $0.24 for things that we don\u2019t anticipate to be recurring parts of our business. Greg Gordon : Okay, that was addressing my question. I appreciate that. Nick Akins : Yes. Greg, I think you have to sort of look at like in the previous quarters we have been talking about working to drive to try to get to a solution for 2016. And now we move to confident about 2016. Greg Gordon : Certainly, you have been taking into account the things you just articulated looking back at your aspiration at the beginning of \u201814 you are doing very well. Nick Akins : Yes. Greg Gordon : The second question is with regard to the timeline for getting an answer from Ohio on whether or not you will be able to contact a portion of that fleet and whether that is the gating factor for concluding an asset sale or whether there is a deadline at which you would move on to the asset sale and not wait around for sort of in an open ended process? Nick Akins : Yes. So, it won\u2019t negate the discussion. I think really what matters here is as we get through the process with Ohio by the end of the year we have a result that says these particular units are going to be covered by a long-term PPA. Then that says that we are sort of ambivalent whether assuming the PPA addresses our concerns as certainly being long-term. We have lots of plan out there and as well some of the other provisions to ensure that we are able to make it quasi regulated, then we are somewhat ambivalent as to whether we hold those units or not. And I think it certainly bodes well for our ability to hold on those units and still be a regulated utility for the remaining assets that aren\u2019t covered by the PPA. There is still a process ongoing. And so we will go through this. And as I said earlier, our Board has been I mean for the last 2 years as you know, we have been going through this with our Board and the PPA because originally we thought it may be later for decision. No one knew, because we didn\u2019t have the schedule. We are concerned by that and we weren\u2019t going to wait for it. And now there is a scheduled employees. There is hearings that have occurred and we will conclude here pretty soon. We will have a result pretty soon and the PPA is very, very important to our standing in Ohio overall and whether we keep that portion of the generation or not, but it doesn\u2019t change the objectivity and the measure of approach that we are using to go through this process to ensure that we are making the right decisions for our shareholders and so, because we get a PPA, it doesn\u2019t mean certainly that the process is off for any of the remaining generation that\u2019s not covered by that type of PPA. So, we are looking at this very straightforward and we have been very consistent in our discussions. I know last quarter or previous quarter we were saying that we were after the capacity options, the capacity performance supplemental options that we would know and understand a lot more we do. We were assuming that it was a never ending approach associated with getting a PPA resolved and it appears that the Ohio Commission has taken this on seriously and are moving forward with determining where their solution would be. And so we are going to go through that process, fully understand it. And by first quarter next year, our Board will certainly know all the ins and outs of the issues that we are dealing with and then we will move forward. Greg Gordon : Great. Is there with the potential there has been chatter about the potential for substantive settlement talks on the \u2013 in the contract discussions, is that going on or not? Nick Akins : You are talking about the PPAs? Greg Gordon : The PPAs, yes. Nick Akins : Well, certainly there has been a lot of chatter and a lot of discussion with multiple parties in this case. And it\u2019s a complex issue and certainly we continue to have conversations and certainly FE can speak for themselves, but we both have the firm belief that there needs to be some kind of support for this generation in Ohio and it\u2019s really a discussion around what those mechanisms would look like. And so we will continue in discussions with the parties. I will stop there. Greg Gordon : Okay, thank you guys. Take care. Nick Akins : Yes. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Anthony Crowdell with Jefferies. Your line is open. Anthony Crowdell : Hey, good morning. I didn\u2019t know you guys are such back to the future fans, but\u2026. Nick Akins : Yes, we all remember that. Some of us do anyway. I am probably talking to some people that don\u2019t even remember us. Anthony Crowdell : If we wanted to [indiscernible] at EEI, Nick, I am okay with it, but\u2026 Nick Akins : Well, you don\u2019t want to happen to think about that, when I was talking about the bold line, boldly going where no man has gone before. Anthony Crowdell : Just great answer as was my question, but just quickly when do you think on the PPA process if we don\u2019t reach a settlement or whatever of fully \u2013 if we end up going on fully litigated track, when do you guys expect that to be finished? Nick Akins : Well, so if it\u2019s fully litigated we still expect to get in order by the end of the year. And that\u2019s now fully litigated means, I mean obviously there will still be, I am sure, there will be appeals and all that kind of stuff, but we are actually focusing on the commission order itself, because that really tells us where the policymaking decision in the state is moving towards. And so we certainly believe that will occur before the end of the year. Anthony Crowdell : Do you think such a big issue like this for Ohio with giving a PPA or entering into PPA, do you think the appeals process would be I guess lessened if you do get a fully litigated order meaning on the parties that are also getting a litigated order just so that the appeals process is maybe less shorter or the record is stronger versus the settlement? Nick Akins : Yes. Certainly, I think it depends on what the order looks like, but certainly the \u2013 I mean, the commission certainly has taken a deliberative approach to this. And we have certainly done a lot of analysis along with others you participate in hearings about can a PPA be used. We feel really good about where we stand from a legal perspective going forward. I think the real issue is the commission needs to come out with an order that comports with the discussions that occurred relative to the PPA. I mean \u2013 so if there is deviation from that in some fashion maybe you could be open yourself up to more substantial appeals. But we have given the recipe, the recipe is there. And certainly, it drives a positive solution for the customers, for Ohio and the commission certainly has the track record to be able to put that kind of thing in place that holds up. Anthony Crowdell : Great. Thanks for taking my question. Nick Akins : Yes. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Praful Mehta with Citigroup. Your line is open. Praful Mehta : Hi, thanks so much for taking my call. Nick Akins : Thanks. Praful Mehta : So my key question was on generation business and as we look at it from an EBITDA perspective year-to-date for the generation business, you have already achieved about $725 million of EBITDA, relative to guidance midpoint of about $5.90 for 2015. So just wanted to understand more long-term like is this more specific things that have happened in 2015 that are driving 2015 EBITDA to be higher, but longer term your guidance stays consistent? Nick Akins : Praful, a couple of things going on there, one is for the first half of the year we still had some considerable capacity revenues coming from Ohio, that dropped off in May and we will be experiencing that negative impact through the balance of the year. So that\u2019s something that on an annualized basis you need to factor that out of the business going forward. We also had two other pieces that contributed to the general marketing results this year that we don\u2019t think you need \u2013 you can consider as regular ongoing items. One is we have had inception gains of about $0.06 per share. And the other is we have had reductions in liabilities that on a positive way flow through O&M associated with the sales of two plants. One is Muskingum River and the other is co-empowerment that we were able to sell. The combination of those two items is another $0.06. So there are some things that you need to factor out if you are going to annualize that business on a go forward looking basis. Praful Mehta : Got it, that\u2019s very helpful. And then finally just a key question on Ohio, I heard your points around the ESP and the PPA, I guess I am just trying to understand from a long-term perspective, I get the message that if it\u2019s long-term, it\u2019s a different answer or you are at least in different between sale versus keeping it. What defines long-term is it 7 years long-term enough if we don\u2019t get the full \u201815, at what point do you say, I actually do have a difference between keeping the business versus selling? Nick Akins : Certainly, I don\u2019t want to get into that too much, because \u2013 long-term, to us, I mean we have followed for the life of plant. And I will just say this, the term has to be substantial, because we have to have a feeling that we can invest and with the large capital investments that we make in generation, we need to know that we can do that and be secure from a future perspective. So when I look at even for our FERC wholesale contracts, we have had contracts that are 10 years, 15 years. We have had same customers for 75 years. So when we talk about long-term, it has to be substantial enough for us to make that kind of investment. And so I am not going to say an actual number at this point, because we have lot of plants sitting out there and that\u2019s what we believe what it takes. And we will wait and see what it wants up being. But I can tell you this, 3 years, which is the length of the capacity deal in PJM that was a 3-year capacity market, that\u2019s not long enough. And that\u2019s a problem within PJM and the state has an opportunity to fix that. Praful Mehta : Got it. Thank you so much. Nick Akins : Yes. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Your line is open. Paul Patterson : Hi, how are you doing? Nick Akins : Fine. Paul Patterson : I just want to follow up I guess on that question about the generation business in the asset retirement obligation. And I saw that we are cutting out a little bit. On Slide 22, I noticed this that there was a $62 million benefit. And just to make sure. I understood that, a lot of that has to do with the asset retirement obligation going away through it, because of some plant sales. And for the most part, you don\u2019t see that recurring is that correct? Nick Akins : Yes. We had reserved asset retirement obligations that ended up being higher than what we were able to realize by selling the plant to a third-party. So, we were able to get the third-party to take those obligations for less than what we had recorded on the books and that allowed us to flow the difference between what we had recorded through O&M. And we have gone back now and checked the remaining plants both from an engineering standpoint and from a marketing standpoint \u2013 from a market standpoint, those values that we have recorded the AROs at and we believe those values to be accurate as they are in the books today. Paul Patterson : Okay. And then just with respect to the AEP Dayton ATC liquidations, which seemed to be sort of leveling off, how should we think about how they actually impacted year-to-date earnings in generation and marketing and how do you see the outlook for those in 2016? Nick Akins : We think those prices are going to continue to be under pressure, but I will say this, Paul, and we have talked about this before. We do have, as we go into a year, significant component of that generation is hedged. So, for the third quarter of this year, we are at about 60% of the margins in megawatt hours. We are hedged going into that period. So, we will have similar amounts hedged going forward in 2016. So for two things, one, we will be able to take advantage of prices that they do recover and we do see them under pressure right now in 2016, but also if we were to have unit outages or increase load from our hedges, we wouldn\u2019t be subject to market pricing for that as well. Paul Patterson : Okay, great. And then back to Ohio in the PPA situation, I mean, take this with a great install, but just over the \u2013 with the outcome if you thought in terms of settlement versus fully litigated, what would you say the odds are that it would be settled as opposed to fully litigated? Nick Akins : I wish I could answer that at this point. There is a lot of context within discussions and there is multiple aspects. There is not just the units that are the generation that\u2019s within a PPA, but really what\u2019s the total answer for Ohio. And I even think about it from a clean power plant perspective. The state of Ohio needs to have some framework for foundation of a transition with base load generation that allows it to make plans associated with ultimate retirements of that generation and replacement with new resources that are put in place. And all incremental resources are either going to be natural gas renewables, certainly, efficiencies regarded the grid itself. Those are the kinds of investments that I think can really drive Ohio to a more balanced energy future that mitigates lot of risk for consumers. And so what we are talking about here is the foundation that we provided for a transition and that\u2019s clearly important. And I think it should be important to the governor, it should be important to the policymakers in the state. And if you drive that kind of solution, you could wind up at a much better place than you would otherwise. And so I know a several lot other than what the direct question you are asking, what\u2019s the percentage of chances, but I think I am going to those kinds of things that should and will be discussed in the framework of supporting a PPA top arrangement. Paul Patterson : Okay. And just I gathered from your previous comments that you feel pretty confident that we will get a decision one way or the other by the end of the year that we just want to make sure that as you know sometimes regulators whatever there is an issue that\u2019s got some whatever \u2013 a lot of speculation, etcetera associated within this delay, default what I am saying. I mean you don\u2019t get the feeling that that you feel pretty confident am I wrong, tell me if I am wrong that you feel that this is very likely to be settled one way or the other by the end of the year? Nick Akins : I think, it will. There is \u2013 it certainly should be settled by the end of the year. And I think goes the settlement route. Then you have to think about okay, how do you argue about the settlement, that kind of stuff and who is involved and all that kind of stuff. If you litigate it, well, the commission needs to make a decision. I am really focused on making sure we drive to a solution as quickly as possible. And this has been 2 years by the way. The first case, it was filed by APE and then FirstEnergy followed up. I think both were certainly, check and speak for them self, but both companies need to get on with the investment and the decisions that need to be made relative to these assets. And I certainly believe there is recognition by the commission that they do need to make this decision. Paul Patterson : Okay, great. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS. Your line is open. Nick Akins : Good morning Julien. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Good morning. So perhaps just to follow-up a little bit of detail from the last question, and again I hate if you will go too much. Is there a minimum tenure that that defines getting a long-term solution for a PPA, I know it\u2019s a transient question, but kind of how do you think about that? Nick Akins : Minimum tenure would be a long time. I just want to make sure that everyone understands that if regardless of the solution here, if there is a PPA, there is sort of two parts of the gate here. One is that the commission approves the PPA. The second is what does the PPA look like? And AEP has been very out-front and very focused and measured in our discussion about this to say that our expectation is a long-term PPA, one that goes past a 3-year ESP cycle or has adjustment mechanisms or all that kind of stuff. We want to make sure that we have a long-term PPA that we can depend on and that we can actually make the investments we need to make. So minimum is long-term. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. Very clear now. Secondly, sort of a bigger picture question, when you think about CPP, obviously we got that finalized recently, how are you thinking about coordination between the various states that you have operations in T&D utilities fully integrated, when do you think you start to get clarity about what needs to happen in each of those states through the filing process, etcetera. I mean and perhaps to add to that, do you have or do you need legislative approval in any state to kick off the CPP compliance? Nick Akins : No, I think we want to make sure that the commissions are certainly involved to this. Now the states are going to take their own approach. I mean, they may litigate. I am sure, some states will litigate it. And \u2013 but that could be done in parallel. Our message is regardless of what you decide to do. You really need to work with us on developing a state implementation plan, because that\u2019s the only way that not only can a state have its own approach. And we keep in mind PPA did allow the states to say, okay, come back with a plan and tell us what the reliability implications are. Because I believe that when the states look at their plans and they go through with the process that needs to occur and if there are reliability implications, they are in a much better position to have a plan and the factual information to support that. So \u2013 and then who knows what administration changes and all that occurs along the way. But you are also in a much better position to negotiate relative to your own state implementation plan as opposed to one size fits all federal plan that it\u2019s very difficult for one state to change. So this is why we are sort of staying out of the arguments whether states and attorney generals and all that get involved from that perspective, from the litigation perspective. We want to make sure that the states continue to move forward. And for us, states that do work with us on developing these plans will be in a much better position, because every filing we make relative to our resource plan, integrated resource plan or other types of plans, we will be able to comport with what the state really wants to see. That maybe based upon their own unique views of where \u2013 how they want to approach this. So, we want to be part of that and be part of that discussion. We want to be able to drive that discussion, because we have a lot of factual information that I think the states will benefit from. We have already started those discussions and we will continue with that dialogue for states that just refuse to do a plan, will continue to look at the clean energy economy of the future and the technology of the future and we will continue to advance that within the resource plans that we have. So, we just want to make sure we have answers to the questions of where states preferences are in terms of resources if they want to move forward with and that were there to do it. And so that\u2019s where we are at. And I believe the states, obviously, have to make their own decisions relative to this, but we are working with the state EPAs and the state public utility commissions. As far as legislation is concerned, we believe each individual state is unique from that perspective, but we will be working with the commissions and we will be making our voice known in terms of where we think it should go in the future. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Great, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Nick Akins : Good morning, Stephen. Stephen Byrd : Good morning. We definitely need more Sci-Fi movie references on earnings calls. So, thank you for that. Nick Akins : Okay, we will work on it. Stephen Byrd : So, most of my questions have been addressed. Just had to or wanted to discuss transmission has always been a good area of growth for you and you are in a pretty strong financial position. I wondered if you could just comment on how bullish you are in terms of finding additional transmission growth opportunities and to the extent that you do see more opportunities, could you talk at a high level at the types of transmission opportunities that you see out there? Nick Akins : Yes. So, we continue to have, I mean, like I said, I think I said last quarter, there is well over 2,000 projects that we are working on today. We have other projects that are waiting for capital and we constantly are reviewing the capital situation that occurs if we wind up with bonus depreciation or other opportunities that we could advance capital. And actually in anticipation of the sale of River ops, we started the transmission spend last quarter when we raised the transmission in anticipation of that, so that we wouldn\u2019t have the delay in terms of the earnings power of transmission associated with that. So, we are constantly looking at ways to do that. You are going to hear more about that at the EEI. So \u2013 and we will have more to say about and I think Brian was talking about the capital plans for the future. We will have more to say about that. Stephen Byrd : Understood. And then just thinking about you had mentioned utility-scale solar investments, when you look across your territories and you think the ability to actually invest capital versus entrants at PPAs. Could you talk at a high level in terms of the regulatory landscape for the decision or preference between direct investment versus being an off-taker? Nick Akins : Yes. We historically have been an off-taker of renewables. We have like over 2,000 megawatts of wind power little tired of others taking credit for wind power when they wouldn\u2019t exist without the PPAs that exist from AEP. So, we are going to be obviously much more outspoken about what we are doing relative to PPAs. But also from an investment perspective, we believe for utility-scale solar we should invest in that, because it is a resource of the future and we have very good operations maintenance and project management expertise that we believe we have something to bring to the table in terms of efficiencies associated with that. So, when we talk to our regulatory jurisdictions, remember, our regulatory jurisdictions are sort of on the cusp of dealing with these kinds of situations. So for us, when we follow resource plan, you are going to see some portion natural gas, you are going to see utility scale solar and you are going to see other grid top efficiency technologies to put in place whether it\u2019s energy storage, whether it\u2019s integrated volt/VAR control, information system deployment, advanced metering, those kinds of things will be key to our future. And that\u2019s something that we are very focused on. So we have transmission. Transmission is a great opportunity for us, because it\u2019s a large scale system that needs refurbishment, so as distribution. Distribution is a great opportunity for us. But even the build out of distributed generation, particularly this type of utility scale, we know where to place it on the system. It could be part of a resource plan that\u2019s filed with commissions. And we are in the best position to build and own that type of generation. Stephen Byrd : Okay, that\u2019s great color. Thank you very much. Nick Akins : The other thing just to add on to that, the other thing that we are doing is we are focused also on PPA arrangements with customers \u2013 directly with customers. And we have done that in some respects with the Ohio State University, with Denison University and others. And as long as we have \u2013 again a long-term PPA to back up supply provisions for energy storage, for utility scale solar, for rooftop solar, we will do it. And so that\u2019s why I say, AEP has a very firm foundation. We are not having to spend large amounts of capital on environmental equipment like we spent $8.2 billion that Brian mentioned earlier. We are about done with that. And we have a real opportunity to advance this company in the future from a new age energy supply perspective. Stephen Byrd : Great. Thanks very much. Nick Akins : Yes. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Hugh Wynne with Bernstein Research. Your line is open. Nick Akins : Good morning Hugh. Hugh Wynne : Good morning. I had a question about the AEP Transmission Holdco. You have had a very good result year-to-date, cents up \u2013 earnings up $0.07 off of 2015 base 30. But third quarter had a uncharacteristically poor result with a sort of flat earnings year-over-year. And I was wondering if you could perhaps explain a little bit what happened if there are any implications for the future? Nick Akins : So, we had a one-time blip there, Hugh, related to O&M. ETP, we had a cross arm issue from some of the build out that we had to do there and we had to spend some dollars to address that physical issue. We don\u2019t anticipate that to be a recurring item. And we believe there was a blip for the quarter and we will be able to get back on track for the end of the year. Hugh Wynne : Okay. And then if I could just quickly following up on the prior question on the Clean Power Plan. Is there a form of regulation or a structure of regulation that you are trying to push your states to consider or are you happy to work with states on their individual objectives even if those are taking materially different structures to regulatory approaches? Nick Akins : Yes. I think we are willing to work with the states on their own individual unique circumstances. And we will be working in that way. Now, what we are looking at is we would rather see and this is so attentive for us because we are still looking at a mass-based approach, because that\u2019s more amicable to trading within states. But we got to have the state solutions before we really understand how important the trading aspects are going to be, but we believe we are better off of the mass-based approach. Hugh Wynne : Is that a view that your other CEOs share or is that a subject to debate? Nick Akins : Yes. You would have to talk to them. Their states may be in different places. I know, California obviously is in a different place and \u2013 but it will be unique to each individual region of the country, I believe and really what kind of resources that you are transitioning from within the states as well. Hugh Wynne : Great, alright and I appreciate that insight. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc. Your line is open. Paul Ridzon : Thanks. Most of my questions have been answered, but can you remind us what your indicative guidance for \u201816 was? Nick Akins : It was 3.45 to 3.85. Paul Ridzon : And any time on how you feel about where in that range things are looking? Nick Akins : We will be updating that at EEI in a couple of weeks. Paul Ridzon : And given that, I guess, the decision of what to do with the Ohio generation is going to be a big driver of \u201816, how you handle that in guidance? Nick Akins : Yes, that\u2019s what Brian said earlier that the forecast for 2016 and the guidance that we will give in November will still include those generation resources. It\u2019s not an assumption that we are going to continue to own. And I will be careful with that. What it does say is that\u2019s what we know today and so we will plan for 2016 with that assumption. And if something does happen first quarter or whenever a transaction is actually completed, then we will have to re-benchmark and adjust. Paul Ridzon : And you indicated you expect oil and gas to expand through \u201816, are there any particular regions where you are driving that expansion? Brian Tierney : Yes, it\u2019s all shale related, Paul. So, it\u2019s Texas, in particular, and then West Virginia and Ohio. Nick Akins : Yes, keep in mind while the rig count is not going up, the electric load is and that\u2019s because there is a lot of consolidation that\u2019s occurring and efficiencies around compressor load that continues to get added. So, just sort of de-link what rig counts doing versus what the electric load itself is doing. Paul Ridzon : Basically, we are behind the curve on the development of the infrastructure to move the gas out and that\u2019s going to continue through \u201816? Nick Akins : That\u2019s right. Paul Ridzon : Okay, thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Your line is open. Shahriar Pourreza : Good morning. Nick Akins : Good morning, Shahriar. Shahriar Pourreza : I know we will touch on 2016 at EEI, but just under a scenario where you retain the approximate 3 gigawatts under a PPA and you sell the remaining 5-gig, does that scenario necessarily have to lend itself to dilution or do you have enough levers to pull IE or 2000 plus power transmission projects or even buybacks to mitigate any type of a dilution opportunity? Nick Akins : Yes, I think you are sort of answering the question and that is we have to understand what, certainly, what the proceeds would be. If there is dilution, then there is all kinds of transactions that could be done to mitigate that. But also from a share buyback and that kind of thing, you could make adjustments there as well. So \u2013 but, it\u2019s too difficult to answer at this point. I mean, there is so many moving parts in that analysis, but we will certainly go through that process. Shahriar Pourreza : Got it. Excellent. Just one last question, obviously, we have got staff throughout on the PPAs and sort of when you look at sort of what the recommendations are, obviously, what\u2019s the most contentious item. Is it the tenure of the PPA? There was certainly some comments as far as the ROE, is everything sort of up for negotiation? Nick Akins : Yes. I guess probably the most contentious issue is the PPA itself. The staff said well, we object to a PPA, but it can work under certain provisions. So, if you get to the second door, then it\u2019s probably tenure and those types of things that would be discussed. I mean, just like with a long-term wholesale provider that we provide to you all the time, it\u2019s always priced tenure and what the provisions are, but I would say certainly on the former getting the PPA addressed and then secondly around tenure and then what\u2019s included. Shahriar Pourreza : Terrific. Thanks so much. Nick Akins : Yes. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andy Levi with Avon Capital Advisors. Your line is open. Andy Levi : Hi, good morning. Can you hear me? Nick Akins : Yes, I can hear you. Andy Levi : Great. Just on the PPAs, could you categorize the settlement talks that are going on? Nick Akins : Well, I have said there were discussions going on. And so we are obviously going through that process and talking about a lot of issues. And really, I can\u2019t say anything more at this time about that, but I can tell you that we are discussing with several parties. Andy Levi : Great, thank you. And then on the potential asset sales generation, I guess, there are two buckets is kind of the way to look at it that could become one bucket or be broken up into two buckets depending on the PPA? Is it possible that the bucket that is not involved in the PPA gets moved before the PPA gets resolved? Nick Akins : I would say not likely, because we are looking for an overall answer to this. I mean, obviously, if the PPA is not put in place, then we have a larger amount of generation that we have to go through this process with. So, they will probably be answered at the same time. Andy Levi : And if you were to get a PPA on the first bucket, would it be possible that you would pursue a PPA for the second bucket? Nick Akins : Well, that\u2019s an interesting question, but I think getting the PPA through and getting whatever units are included in the PPA, well, I would say that the open units that aren\u2019t included in the PPA, we are not going to assume that they are going to be brought back in at some later time. So besides, we really don\u2019t have the time for that. Andy Levi : And just regulatory wise, right, the only potential for PPA at this stage is with what\u2019s been filed for, right? You wouldn't be able to add megawatts or assets to that to a settlement process could you? Nick Akins : Unless, there is a settlement. Andy Levi : So through a settlement, it\u2019s possible to add megawatts for no better way to put it I guess\u2026 Nick Akins : Well\u2026. Andy Levi : Is that correct or? Nick Akins : Yes, but then you wind up with a lot of additional discovery and that kind of stuff around that. So, I am just saying, potentially it could be done, but it would open up perhaps another can of worms that we have to deal with. Andy Levi : Got it. Okay. Thank you. See you soon. Bette Jo Rozsa : Operator, we have time for one more question. Operator : Thank you. And that will be from the line of Ali Agha with SunTrust. Your line is open. Ali Agha : Thank you. Nick Akins : Good morning, Ali. Ali Agha : Good morning. I know that, Brian, you mentioned that on \u201816 guidance you have assumed the sale of the River Operation, but you have kept the generation as is. Should we assume that sale at least from a timing perspective is dilutive in \u201816? Is that a fair assumption? Brian Tierney : The sale of River ops? Ali Agha : Yes. Brian Tierney : No. So, Ali, let\u2019s just look at recent earnings history from that business. Last year, we earned $0.10. This year, we are forecast to earn $0.08 for the year. In \u201812 and \u201813, we earned $0.02 per share from that business. So, I would not think of that as being dilutive for 2016. Ali Agha : Okay. And then also Brian, as you mentioned earlier, your current 4% to 6% growth is based of the midpoint of the original \u201814 guidance. So, as we look forward is that sort of the way to be thinking about it that when you are looking at 4% to 6%, we should use like your original midpoint of your \u201815 guidance as you move things forward or conceptually how should we be thinking about what base to use for that 4% to 6% going forward? Nick Akins : We will lay out a framework for that at EEI. I need to stop talking about 2014 original guidance, because that\u2019s getting pretty far back in the rearview mirror now, but we will layout that framework at EEI. It\u2019s \u2013 our long-term anticipated growth rate is 4% to 6%. And we can normalize everything and take you through that discussion in more detail at EEI with some charts that were put together. Ali Agha : I got it. And last question, Nick, as you looked at the timeline on strategic issues on merging the Ohio PPA. Obviously, things have moved as other events have gotten delayed. Are you now at a point where you say, look, we think this will happen by year end and so we will get 30 by early next year, but if regulatory processes continue to get shifted further, is early next year sort of casting stone in your mine to finally resolve the strategic issue on merchant or would you still be flexible depending on how the PPA staff is moving? Nick Akins : This thing is going on long in that. And I think that we have to get on with making a decision and really our Board has been dealing with this for 1.5, 2 years now as well. So, it\u2019s very important that we get the answers that we need from the commission, so that we understand what Ohio\u2019s policy is going to be in the future. So, my view is that first quarter this coming year, we will have an answer ready with the commission that we know not so much whether it holds up in quarter or anything like that or what the thinking is. And that\u2019s what\u2019s clearly important is the way we address this process and to not be thinking about it for a long period of time or not hearing what people are thinking about it externally from a policy perspective. That is very important to us. So, my view is our patience is sort of run then here and we need to get on with it. Ali Agha : Just to clarify, so if the PPA ride their discussion for whatever reason is continuing beyond Q1, you are not going to wait for that to continue beyond that, is that fair? Nick Akins : I think that\u2019s fair. I think that\u2019s fair. Now, I can\u2019t say that on January 29 or January 30, we think we are going to get an order on February 1 that we are going to pull the plug on January 30. We just \u2013 but we fully expect the commission to get done by year end and then, we will go about the process as quickly as we can to focus on what the future holds. And so I am just saying that first quarter will be, we should be in a position where we move on. Ali Agha : Understood. Thank you. Bette Jo Rozsa : Thank you for joining us on today\u2019s call. As always, the IR team will be available to answer any additional questions you may have. Cynthia, would you please give the replay information? Operator : Certainly.

Welcome to the American Electric Power Fourth Quarter 2015 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Ms. Bette Jo Rozsa. Please go ahead. Bette Jo Rozsa : Thank you, Tom. Good morning, everyone and welcome to the fourth quarter 2015 earnings call for American Electric Power. We are glad that you are able to join us today. Our earnings release, presentation slides and related financial information are available on our website at aep.com. Today, we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors. Joining me this morning for opening remarks are Nick Akins, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and Brian Tierney, our Chief Financial Officer. We will take your questions following their remarks. I will now turn the call over to Nick. Nick Akins : Okay. Thanks, Bette Jo. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining AEP\u2019s fourth quarter 2015 earnings call. 2015 will be remembered as a year of significant transition that culminated a 4-year process of focusing on the fundamentals of our business to drive consistency, execution and discipline while driving toward a strategic vision of what the next premium regulated utility should look like. The balance sheet of AEP is strong and we continue to deliver for our shareholders quarter after quarter from a dividend and earnings growth perspective despite various headwinds that have occurred along the way. This quarter and the year, 2015 are no exceptions. First, let\u2019s talk about the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter \u201815 GAAP and operating earnings came in at $0.96 per share and $0.48 per share respectively compared with fourth quarter \u201814 GAAP and operating earnings of $0.39 per share and $0.48 per share respectively. The difference in fourth quarter 2015 GAAP and operating earnings being mainly driven by the sale of AEP River Operations. Fourth quarter was unusual in the sense that winter particularly in December never occurred. It was more like an April. Even so, operating earnings were consistent with fourth quarter last year even though we gave back approximately $0.11 per share cold weather related load margins finishing the year solidly within our revised guidance range at $3.69 per share operating. The year finished at $4.17 per share on a GAAP basis as well compared with \u201814 results of $3.34 per share and $3.43 per share GAAP and operating earnings respectively. As can be seen on the graph on the right of Page 3 of the presentation, AEP has consistently performed better than the utility index for the 1, 3 and 5-year periods and as well outperformed the S&P 500 Index over the last 3-year and 5-year periods and lagged the index over the last year given the interest rate and other sensitivities in the electric utility sector in general. Overall, AEP continues to perform very well as the story of the stock continues to become more clear and resonate in the market. Operating earnings growth year-on-year was 7.6% and we achieved our expected regulated ROE of 9.6% for the year, which increased from the 9% experienced in 2014. During 2015, we also increased the dividend by 5.7% on an annualized basis consistent with our earnings growth and within our stated dividend payout range of 60% to 70%. I mentioned AEP is in transition earlier. There were a couple of important milestones that we achieved during the year, particularly in fourth quarter. Namely, AEP completed the sale of River Operations that we discussed during the third quarter 2015 earnings call and we reached the settlement with several parties regarding the AEP Ohio PPA case. AEP sale of River Operations occurred during the fourth quarter and the transaction occurred according to plan. The cash proceeds were redeployed in advance of the sale by raising our capital forecast for transmission and then by raising our overall capital plan to $5 billion for 2016 at the November EEI Financial Conference, focus on additional regulated operating company and transmission activities. So, we have successfully converted that portion of volatile earnings to a more consistent, regulated earnings profile. Regarding the AEP Ohio PPA case, we made significant progress by completing a settlement among the parties, including the staff of the PUCO, along with the industrials, Sierra Club, retail providers and others that defines the PPA relationship and the unregulated generation to AEP Ohio customers. The agreement answers the question of how long is long-term? 8 years with a cost based agreement with a return and an adjustment mechanism that works much like a fuel cost pass-through provision. AEP does guarantee up to $100 million credit to customers at the end of the agreement if in the unexpected event the anticipated savings do not materialize. This deal is a great deal for AEP, our customers and the state of Ohio to ensure capacity is maintained for the benefit of customers during a transition period, where markets do not have a long-term capacity product and during the movement toward the clean energy future contemplated by the Clean Power Plan. AEP also expects to re-power, retire or refuel generation as part of this transition and build up the 900 megawatts of renewable solar and wind generation to achieve a balanced generation portfolio for Ohio\u2019s future. This arrangement, when approved by the Ohio Commission, will be a model that can be used nationally to assess the tone for parties with substantially different positions about generation resources and the pace of change to come together focusing on the clean energy future and the mitigation of transition cost increases that our customers and the public expect. AEP and the utilities in the U.S. are the ones that can bring the parties together to work with the states defined as clean energy future and deploy advanced technologies to improve our customer\u2019s experience while ensuring that the benefits are universal to all the customers. As with any agreement, AEP and the other parties didn\u2019t get everything they wanted, but this overall is a good deal that provides clarity and will ultimately benefit our customers and should be approved by the PUCO as quickly as possible. We expect the record to be concluded by February 8 and an order from the Commission shortly thereafter. Assuming that\u2019s the case, the spotlight will move to the remaining unregulated generation which we expect the ongoing strategic process to rapidly move to completion. This will set the stage for the next phase of AEP development with a firm financial foundation and position the company for the future. Moving to expectations for 2016, we reaffirm our guidance range of $3.60 to $3.80 per share and we will continue our focus on disciplined capital allocation, emphasizing investments in our regulated companies and transmission with CapEx budget of $5 billion for 2016. AEP continues to project long-term earnings growth of 4% to 6%. Additionally, as a result of the available bonus depreciation, as a result of the 2015 tax bill from Congress, and our ability to invest as a result of the incremental cash, we are raising our capital budgets for the succeeding years to $5 billion in 2017 and $5 billion in 2018. This will enable us to put money to work on behalf of our customers for needed infrastructure, including transmission means basically interest-free while maintaining rate base levels that support earnings growth. Brian will be covering the subject of customer load in a few minutes. But I would like to say since the economic recovery began post-2008, we have seen quarter after quarter of inconsistent results, indicating the economy, while generally getting better, is still challenged in several sectors. Also, we have moved from one extreme to another from a weather perspective from the polar vortex in 2014 to the warmest fourth quarter in the last 30 years in 2015. So, it\u2019s difficult to evaluate sustaining trends at this point. We continue to believe load will increase overall during 2016 albeit at a slightly slower pace than originally forecasted, but not enough for AEP to adjust guidance. During 2016, we will focus on obtaining approval for the Ohio PPA settlement, continue our strategic review of competitive generation and continue to work with our states on ways to comply with the Clean Power Plan, all with the continued focus on driving efficiencies through lean initiatives, capital allocation, disciplined operational excellence and continual focus on cultural initiatives that I believe is a prerequisite to remain agile and innovative for the future. Now, I will move over to the equalizer graph, which we go over every quarter and this sort of rolls out for the year. The 2015 earned regulated ROE on the left side of the page and then what we anticipate for the 2016 pro forma regulated ROE on the right side of the page. So, let\u2019s talk about Ohio Power for the Ohio area. AEP Ohio is in line with expectations and we expect to finish the year in line with the 12% ROE that\u2019s forecasted. As far as APCO is concerned, the West Virginia rate case that we got achieved in 2015 addressed the weak returns in West Virginia. So, it helped the ROEs in APCO as well. Rates were implemented in June of 2015. So, we expect to see that the rate case will also help improve the ROE in 2016 for APCO. Kentucky, it\u2019s good to see it coming up. We are seeing the expected improvement at year end. The commission authorized the $45 million rate increase in July with 10.25% ROE to be used in weighted average cost of capital for riders and AFUDC. So we continue to see an increase from that perspective, which last quarter as you recall, it was locally short. I&M achieves an ROE of 10.2%. This was a result of positive regulatory outcomes associated long-term capital investment programs in generation Rockport SCR, solar and nuclear with a critical lifecycle management and transmission projects as well. So I&M is well positioned for another positive year end 2016. PSO\u2019s ROE is generally in line with expectations. The economy in Oklahoma experienced a slowdown due in part to lower oil prices and reduced oil and gas activity in the state in December though the Oklahoma Corporation Commission heard the rate case and PSO implemented interim rates of $75 million at the first of the year. So a final commission order is expected in the second \u2013 during the second quarter of this year. SWEPCO continues to be somewhat of a challenge. The operations are strong, but it\u2019s challenged in the oil and gas area, natural gas price area. And as well the continued issue with Arkansas portion of the Turk plant which we continue to analyze alternatives for that, hopefully a retail rate case in Arkansas at some point would be helpful from that perspective. AEP Texas, the ongoing distribution capital investment in TCC to serve higher levels of electric load and to maintain the reliability of the grid has gradually lowered the regulated ROE over time. AEP Texas continues to monitor the earnings levels and the jurisdictions. They basically have three avenues available to them. One is the transmission, T calls transmission capital cases that they have been involved with currently, and then also, whether it\u2019s a traditional rate case filing or under the legislated approach of the distribution costs recovery factor, that\u2019s another opportunity for them as well. So they can look at earnings and we will focus on those alternatives. As far as the AEP Transco \u2013 Transmission Holdco, transmission was at 11.1%. It should drop to 10.2% during the year. But obviously, we are spending a huge amount of capital in the transmission area so you do have some lag there. So with that said, overall, the regulated ROEs are moving from 9.6% to an expected 10.1% for the year. So overall, we should have a good year from a regulatory standpoint. Now that we are in 2016 and before I turn it over to Brian, I will end by saying, I was recently struck by an article I was reading on the 2016 commemoration of 50 years of Star Trek. While it all started with the original series in 1966 with a 5-year mission, it has over the last 50 years, consistently reinvented itself to remain relevant. AEP after 110 years is doing the same thing. This team started out in 2012 after a rough period in Ohio on a 5-year mission of our own that\u2019s set a course toward a firm foundation around execution and discipline to advance operationally, financially and culturally. AEP has performed well since then despite some significant headwinds and as we move into 2016, our focus remains the same to complete our mission to position AEP as the next premium regulated utility. This will provide AEP the firm foundation to reinvent itself by focusing on the customer experience, resources or technologies of the future and disciplined capital allocation to become the model utility of the future. So the next generation is about to begin. So Brian, make it certainly number one. Brian Tierney : Thank you, Nick and good morning everyone. I will be taking us through the financial results for both the quarter and the year with most of the focus on the annual results. Let\u2019s begin on Slide 6 with the fourth quarter comparison where operating earnings for both years were $0.48 per share despite extremely mild temperatures which adversely affected the quarter by $0.11 per share as well as lower earnings from our competitive businesses. Total company earnings were unchanged from last year. These unfavorable drivers were effectively offset by favorable rate proceedings, the absence of unfavorable regulatory provisions from 2014 and the decline in the effective tax rate, each of which added $0.09 to the fourth quarter of 2015. Turning to Slide 7, you will see that the fourth quarter\u2019s earnings when added to the results through September pushed our annual operating earnings to $3.69 per share compared to $3.43 per share in 2014, an increase of 7.6%. The increase in earnings for our largest segment, Vertically Integrated Utilities, was the primary factor contributing to the overall increase in earnings. The major drivers for this segment include the favorable effects of rate changes, regulatory provisions and lower O&M and income tax expenses, partially offset by reduced margins from retail and wholesale energy sales. Rate changes were recognized across many of our jurisdictions, adding $0.31 per share to the year. This favorable effect on earnings is related to incremental investment to serve our customers as well as the successful transfer of the Mitchell plant to Wheeling Power. The effective regulatory provisions bolstered boosted earnings by $0.12 per share due to the Virginia legislative change and the unfavorable Kentucky fuel order in 2014. Lower O&M expense for this segment favorably affected comparison by $0.06 per share, primarily driven by lower employee-related costs. Similar to the quarterly comparison, the annual effective tax rate for this segment was lower in 2015 due to the impact of annual tax rate adjustments and the effect of accounting for tax items on the flow-through basis. Partially offsetting these favorable items were declines in normalized margins in our system sales, net of PJM charges. The lower normalized margins which reduced earnings by $0.09 per share were driven by lower usage across most of our operating regions. I will talk more about load in the economy in a few minutes. The $0.17 per share decline in off-system sales reflects the significant margins realized during the polar vortex events in early 2014 and the soft power prices in 2015. The transmission and distribution utility segment earned $0.72 per share for the year, matching the results for 2014. The major drivers for this segment include the favorable effective rate changes and regulatory provisions, offset by lower off-system sales margins and higher O&M expenses. Rate changes added $0.04 per share to earnings, primarily related to the recovery of distribution investment in Ohio. Unfavorable Ohio regulatory provisions in 2014 that did not repeat created a favorable variance, adding $0.04 per share. The decline of $0.04 per share in earnings related to off-system sales margins was related to the Ohio Commission\u2019s order on OBEC. O&M expense was higher than last year, which lowered the results for this segment by $0.05 per share. This was due in part to intentional incremental spending with the remaining change related to regulatory commitments in Ohio. The Transmission Holdco segment continues to grow, contributing $0.39 per share for the year, an improvement of $0.08 or 26%, reflecting our continued significant investment in this area. In the past 12 months, this segment\u2019s net plant less deferred taxes grew by approximately $1 billion, an increase of 49%. The Generation and Marketing segment produced earnings of $0.75 per share, down $0.09. However, this segment exceeded expectations in several areas. The lower capacity revenues in Ohio, beginning in June, contributed to Generation Resource\u2019s decline in earnings of $0.11 per share. This was partially offset by the favorable effect of lower fuel costs and favorable hedging activity, helping to add energy margins in the period of soft power prices. In addition, expenses were lower due to unit retirements and the sale of properties which allowed for the reversal of certain ARO liabilities. Our trading and marketing organization also performed well, exceeding last year\u2019s results by $0.03. Our retail business exceeded 2014 results by $0.04. AEP River Operations, which was sold in mid-November, contributed $0.06 per share to this year\u2019s results, $0.04 lower than 2014. We have been deploying the proceeds from this transaction into our regulated businesses. Corporate and Other produced a loss of $0.06 per share, down $0.07 for the year. The decline was driven by higher O&M expenses, franchise taxes and other costs. Our performance throughout the year resulted in our raising guidance twice with the final results solidly in the latest range. Despite the headwinds associated with lower capacity revenue in Ohio, 2015 was a successful year for AEP, both financially and operationally. Now let\u2019s take a look at Slide 8 to review normalized load performance for the quarter. Before we go into particulars by class, I would like to provide some context around the load as depicted on this slide. If just look at the bars, you will notice that they are volatile from one quarter to the next. It\u2019s important to remember that these comparisons are not to the prior quarter but to the prior year. So this year\u2019s fourth quarter is being compared to the fourth quarter of 2014 which as you can see was particularly strong across all classes. With that context, let\u2019s now plow into the detail for the fourth quarter of 2015. Starting in the lower right, you see there a load decrease by 3.7% compared to the strong fourth quarter results in 2014. This brings the annual normalized load contraction to eight tens of a percent. The upper left quadrant shows that our residential sales were down 4% for the quarter and 1.8% for the year. While we are starting to see the impact of lower energy prices on a regional economy, most of the decrease is a result of the unusually strong 2014. If you compare our normalized residential sales in 2015 to 2013, volumes were down only by an average of 0.4% per year. In the upper right corner, commercial sales were down 3.9% for the quarter compared to 2014. Both commercial and residential sales were stronger in our Eastern and Western territories, which is consistent with the economic indicators I will share with you on the next slide. For the year, commercial sales were down 0.2%. The strongest growth in commercial sales happened in Ohio Power and in I&M, where majority of our auto-related jobs are located. As you know, 2015 was a banner year for domestic auto sales. This was certainly one of the bright spots in our regional economy. Finally, the lower left quadrant shows that our industrial sales were down 3.3% for the quarter and 0.2% for the year. We saw the biggest decline in our largest sector, primary metals, which was down 21% this quarter. The weak global demand, strong dollar and oversupply of Chinese steel, has created a challenging market for our metals customers and export manufacturers. Fortunately, we continue to see robust growth from our customers in oil and gas related sectors to help offset the decline in manufacturing load. I will provide more detail on this later in the presentation. Now, let\u2019s review the most recent economic data for AEP service territory on Slide 9. Let\u2019s start on the left hand side of the page, where we compare the economy of the U.S. to that of AEP service territory. For both GDP growth and employment growth, AEP service territory trails the U.S., but both indicators for AEP have been relatively stable for the last several quarters. The interesting detail is on the right side of the slide, where we compare the U.S. indicators to AEP East and AEP West separately. What this shows is U.S. and AEP West GDP and employment growth are slowing, while rates are improving for AEP East. The deceleration in AEP\u2019s western service area is associated with energy sector job losses. The acceleration in AEP\u2019s eastern territory is associated with auto, healthcare and professional service sectors. U.S. auto sales in 2015 were at their highest level since 2000. We are also seeing exceptional growth in recreational vehicle shipments, which have tripled over the last 5 years. This has been an important boost for places like Elkhart, Indiana, whose economy is largely independent on transportation manufacturing. And finally, the relatively low business costs, along with higher educated workforce in places like Columbus, Ohio, have created an attractive business environment resulting in over 11,000 new healthcare and professional service jobs in 2015. Turning to Slide 10, I will provide an update on the domestic shale gas activity within AEP\u2019s footprint. Given the impact of low energy prices we are having on our regional economy, one might expect our electricity sales to the oil and gas related sectors to be down. However, as you can see in the upper left chart, we are still seeing over 10% growth in our sales to oil and gas sectors this quarter despite oil prices being down 40% from last year, rig counts being down by nearly two-thirds and the fact that there are significantly fewer oil and gas workers today than we had at the end of 2014. In fact, the bottom left chart shows that our sales to oil and gas sectors are at all-time highs. The upper right chart shows that growth in oil and gas loads was spread across all major shale plays within AEP service territory with the strongest growth coming from the Permian, Woodford and Eagle Ford shales. If we dissect the oil and gas growth into its components as shown in the bottom left chart, we continue to see the strongest growth from the pipeline transportation sector, which grew by over 33% in 2015. This was mostly due to the expanding infrastructure in West Virginia, Ohio and Texas to support the Marcellus, Utica and Texas shales. Our oil and gas extraction volumes were up nearly 7%, while petroleum and coal product sales grew by approximately 1% in 2015. We still have a number of oil and gas related expansions expected to come online over the next 18 months that should drive our industrial sales growth through 2016. Obviously, we are monitoring the situation closely, given current oil prices and we will update you on these segments throughout the year. In contrast to the oil and gas sectors, the red bars in the upper left chart show that sales to the remaining industrial sectors are not growing as they were last year at this point, down 5.3% for the quarter. Now, let\u2019s turn to Slide 11 and review the company\u2019s capitalization and liquidity. Our debt to total capital improved by 0.2% this quarter and is now in a healthy 53.2%. Our credit metrics, FFO interest coverage and FFO to debt are solidly in the BBB and Baa1 range at 5.5x and 20.8% respectively. Our qualified pension funding held firm this quarter at 97%. During the quarter, a slight decrease in the asset returns was offset by a slight increase in the discount rate. Our pension assets are now weighted at 60% and duration matching fixed income securities with the balance being held in global equity and alternative investments. We adopted this more conservative investment stance in 2014 to better align the investment portfolio with the pension obligation. Our OPEB obligations remain fully funded, but decreased from 112% to 109% during the quarter. Although plain investment returns were positive, they were more than offset by an increase in higher healthcare costs. Finally, our net liquidity stands at $3.5 billion and is supported by our two revolving credit facilities that extend over for the summers of 2017 and 2018. Let\u2019s see if we can wrap this up on Slide 12 and then quickly get to your questions. The employees of American Electric Power have a proven track record. Over the last several years, they have delivered operating earnings growth within our targeted 4% to 6% range and we have grown the dividend in line with earnings. With the current dividend at the midpoint of annual operating earnings guidance, we anticipate paying out 61% of total earnings and 68% of regulated earnings in 2016. Our employees have executed continuous improvement initiatives, lean activities and have begun the cultural transformation that has allowed us to keep expenses in a very tight range of $2.8 million to $3.1 billion net of earnings offsets since 2011. We forecast expenses net of offsets this year to be in the $2.8 billion range. In addition, our employees have been thoughtful about every $1 of investment in our system. We have allocated more dollars to the wire side of our business and designed our Transco business to allow for the efficient deployment of low cost capital for the benefit of our customers. At this point, let me say a word about bonus depreciation. This cash saving vehicle is not new to us. For several years now, AEP has elected bonus depreciation. During this time, the company has consistently grown rate base and earnings. Earlier, you heard Nick announce that we will increase our capital spending by $1 billion in both 2017 and 2018. Our customers will realize improved service at a savings due to the rate reducing impacts of the regulatory flow back of accumulated deferred income taxes and AEP will be able to grow earnings. In this way, our community\u2019s benefit through increased economic activity, our customers benefit through rate savings and our debt and equity holders benefit through the maintenance of our cash flow metrics as we grow our net plant and service. The ability to make incremental investment in our own system for the benefit of our customers differentiates AEP. Looking ahead to 2016, we are reaffirming our operating earnings guidance of between $3.60 to $3.80 per share. We are keeping our CapEx plans for 2016 at $5 billion while increasing our CapEx forecast in 2017 and 2018 to $5 billion per year. And finally, as Nick said, we anticipate getting clarity on the Ohio PPA and the strategic review of our competitive businesses. We experienced the successful 2015 and are poised for success in 2016 and beyond. With that, I will turn the call over to the operator for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Greg Gordon : Thanks. Good morning, guys. Nick Akins : Good morning, Greg. How are you? Greg Gordon : I am well. My first question goes to your last point, when I look at Slide 31 of the handout, certainly one of the hallmarks of the company under your management has been a very, very focused on balance sheet integrity. And what I see here is that from \u201816 to \u201818, you are \u2013 even with the increase in capital spending, because there is such a significant increase in cash from operations, your \u201816 to \u201818 excess capital required is down by $1.1 billion, plus your debt capital market needs are also down by $1.1 billion, doesn\u2019t that basically flow to retained earnings and further potentially strengthen the balance sheet from here? Nick Akins : It does, Greg. And so the issue is, part of what we talk about here is increasing the CapEx sum. But as we get the increase in retained earnings that also increases our ability to access debt capital markets and we will be reviewing that as we evaluate our plans as we enter a period where we will be spending in order to get ready for the Clean Power Plan and other opportunities like that later this decade. Greg Gordon : But it\u2019s fair just eyeballing this to say that exiting \u201818, the balance sheet should be in an even stronger position than it is today, unless you decide to spend further capital over the period? Brian Tierney : Yes. We have not consumed all of the excess cash that bonus depreciation extension has created for us. Greg Gordon : Great, that was my key question. Thanks. I will let somebody else ask and go the back if I have more. Nick Akins : Yes. It is interesting Greg, that this time around, Congress instead of waiting until the end of the year to give the existing year, they did the 5 years. So it really helped in terms of the cash and capital planning. And you are right we didn\u2019t have it utilized all of the capital available to us. But nevertheless, we will continue to focus on additional opportunities for us, particularly as it relates to infrastructure spending. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Michael Weinstein with UBS. Please go ahead. Michael Weinstein : Hello, just a follow-up on Greg\u2019s question. Does that mean that you could in theory lever up more on certain subsidiaries as for just transmission going forward, is that one of the possibilities? Brian Tierney : Yes. So debt avoidance is one of the possibilities that we are looking at. Obviously, the closest thing that we have done is spending incremental CapEx. But debt avoidance and/or levering up our opportunities that the incremental cash makes available to us. Michael Weinstein : I am just thinking of the stronger balance sheet you could also lever \u2013 increase the leverage on that subsidiary? Brian Tierney : We could, Michael. Michael Weinstein : Okay. And then also I was wondering if you can go into a little bit more detail as to why you think sales forecast for the shale plays will continue to be in 0.9% or continue to grow going forward that you don\u2019t see any potential problems, I guess in the next 2 years or considering the low prices? Nick Akins : It is interesting because we continue to see more and more opportunities for the electric load to continue to pick up in addition to compressor loads, optimization within the fields of sales, improved production of the existing wells, that continues. And of course, we are also looking very closely at new opportunities that are coming online that have been identified, engaging the progress of them coming in 2016 as well. So we continue to \u2013 and we are in very close touch with our customers out there, particularly ones who have discussed expansion or addition of new facilities and keeping in touch with them about timing of projects and the additional load associated with that. So we are keeping our ear close to the ground on all of that activity. Operator : Next question is from the line of Praful Mehta with Citigroup. Please go ahead. Praful Mehta : Hi guys. Nick Akins : Hello. Praful Mehta : Hi, my question was firstly on the EPS and cash flow guidance that you have for \u201816 and obviously the cash flow guidance going out as well, what is embedded in that in terms of both the PPA and also the outcome of the strategic review? Nick Akins : Yes. We don\u2019t have anything in there for that forecast at this point. And what we will do, obviously we want to get the PPA done and evaluate fully where we are at in terms of not only the incremental, any incremental earnings associated with the PPA. But obviously, we have other factors we are looking at in terms of load and other issues to look at. So we will deal with that one when that time comes. Praful Mehta : Got it. Just to be clear, if there is a PPA, outcome is positive, then that obviously is an incremental upside to the guidance you have right now, is that fair? Nick Akins : So we have to work through that process and fully understand it first. So I don\u2019t want to get out on a limb and tell you that that would be the case. But obviously, getting the PPA in place will be very good for the company. But we are also looking at, like I said other things that may \u2013 because I think at the first quarter, we will probably have a better handle on what load looks like and then see that the relative degree of consistency to make it good, really a good forecast in terms of guidance and that kind of thing. Brian Tierney : Praful, I think if we were to get new data sets around a PPA and/or disposition of a business, I think it would be incumbent on us to provide and update the guidance and we would do that. Praful Mehta : Thanks. That\u2019s very helpful. And then secondly, I heard there is rumblings around a legal challenge associated with the PPA, who knows where that goes, but just trying to understand, if that legal challenge comes up, how does that impact strategic review of the non-PPA assets, because I am assuming the outcome of that legal challenge would have an impact on the buyers view about the value of the assets? Nick Akins : Well, okay, so let\u2019s keep in mind there is really two sets of assets here. One is the ones that are covered under the PPA. And the other are probably rumblings and probably more than rumblings. At this point there is filings have been made apparently. And if you have the PPA piece of it, that\u2019s really about 3,000 megawatts of generation nominally. Then you have the other 6,000 megawatts out there normally that would be associated with the remaining unregulated. So if there is a case out there, I think anyone that would look at it, if it\u2019s only unregulated part of the generation, they \u2013 there will be people who are buying unregulated assets and fully understand the risk associated with that. As far as the PPA is concerned, we will continue to progress associated with the PPA. Those cases will work themselves through. We feel like we are in very good shape from a legal perspective. There is a lot of dust being kicked up. But that\u2019s what happens when you try to do progressive things, particularly things that have the state supported self as opposed to waiting on a Federal outcome for a long-term capacity market for example. So I think any perspective buyer in a transaction on unregulated generation, they would fully understand what the issues are and the risk involved. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Christopher Turnure with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Christopher Turnure : Good morning guys. Nick Akins : Good morning. Christopher Turnure : I have more kind of CapEx and balance sheet questions here to kind of follow on some of the previous questions as well. First, on the incremental CapEx of $2 billion over 2 years, kind of what\u2019s embedded in that, it looks like it\u2019s mostly transmission related, but is there any incremental renewables in there that stem from the PPA settlement. And then also on your ability to finance that capital kind of how do you think about the moving parts there, especially in \u201817 and \u201818 given the fact that you are not assuming any kind of asset sale proceeds, any PPA incremental cash. And I think my understanding of your tax situation was that even though bonus depreciation is certainly adding to your potential in outer years, you probably wouldn\u2019t have been a cash tax payer in \u201817 and \u201818 anyway. So how does the bonus depreciation going to help your cash in those years to finance some of this incremental capital? Nick Akins : So let me touch the point on what\u2019s covered under the $2 billion that\u2019s included. Yes, you are right, a majority of it is transmission. And then there is some on the rest of the regulated activity. But there is also a piece in there associated with as you mentioned renewable projects. But it\u2019s not related to the PPA. It\u2019s really not to the Ohio PPA. It\u2019s related to other arrangements, there are other PPA arrangements that we have for long-term PPAs with solar projects, universities and that kind of thing. So it very much supports what we are trying to achieve from a customer side of things. We go out and we participate in arrangements that with long-term PPAs with creditworthy counterparties to ensure that we can put those kinds of facilities in place. And you see a category there. I think that\u2019s competitive parts, where that competitive part is really around our onsite partners\u2019 opportunities associated with projects that they are doing with that are supported by long-term PPAs. Brian Tierney : So \u2013 and let me address Chris for the last part of your question. Without the extension of bonus depreciation, we were going to be significant taxpayers beginning in 2016 and in 2017 and going forward. So, this does significantly change our cash position. And as Nick just said in his response, we have not committed dollars yet for the renewables associated with the PPA. If that\u2019s gets passed, that will be an opportunity for incremental investment that\u2019s currently not in our CapEx plans. And if there were any proceeds from sale of any assets or businesses that we have that would be incremental to our balance sheet and cash flow position as well. Christopher Turnure : Okay, great. That\u2019s very clear. And then just another kind of follow-up on the load side here. You mentioned that you do kind of expect somewhat of a continuance in the E&P and energy-related sectors there in growth or at least stability there. Kind of what else are you thinking in terms of growth by customer class that underlies your 80 basis points of growth overall for next year? Nick Akins : Well, certainly, all our manufacturing, travel and leisure, those categories continue to grow. Brian, you may have others? Brian Tierney : Healthcare and business services are other areas that we are seeing growth, particularly in places like Ohio and I&M. Nick Akins : We mentioned RV sales and I remember when President Obama was running for office in 2008, one of the places that he was going is the sign of a downturn economy was Elkhart, Indiana. And if you look at Elkhart, Indiana now, it\u2019s just absolutely booming with RV sales being up as much as they are. So, that\u2019s another sector where we are seeing significant improvement. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Anthony Crowdell with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Anthony Crowdell : Hey, good morning. I appreciate the Star Trek reference in last quarter, but back to the future. Just a couple of questions. First, easy one on your favorite equalizer slide, transmission ROE is coming down in \u201816. You said there is some lag there. Do you think that returns back in \u201817? Nick Akins : I don\u2019t have those numbers, but I would expect as we continue to accelerate transmission, I think it will probably stay pretty steady be my guess, but we obviously have to look at the investment cycle there, but obviously transmission continues to be a near-term investment recovery perspective and as long as we can accelerate it and bring those earnings in, which we started to do obviously last year, then we can mitigate the impact of the ROE drop. And then you also have couple of other things that are occurring in there as well. ETT, ROE is also forecasted to decrease from 11.7 down to 10.4. So, that\u2019s sort of embedded in there as well. And obviously, you will have interim T calls, filings need to be made. And so I fully expect it to stay relatively consistent with that. Anthony Crowdell : Also staying with the equalizer slide if I look at Kentucky Power, I mean, that\u2019s the smallest ball here. I guess, it\u2019s the smallest contributor for earnings. With the market and people paying exorbitant premiums for at least some of these smaller utilities, any thought of monetizing that? It doesn\u2019t really seem instrumental into the AEP story and it\u2019s also lagging your ROEs there. Brian Tierney : I get that question quite often. And Kentucky, on the one hand, it certainly is a regulated jurisdiction. So, we are still in the process of becoming more fully regulated and I sort of measure it up from that approach. Number one, it\u2019s a regulated entity. Number two, it\u2019s been one that it was one of the first to do a rider for cyber. It was one of the first to allow the transfer of Mitchell. So, while it maybe small, there are some positive things about that jurisdiction that we obviously have to take a look at. But what you are saying obviously is we see that going on in the market as well. But at this point, we are focused on being a premium regulated utility and that means we need to deal with the issues that everyone is asking us about and that is our strategic discussion around the unregulated generation. So, that\u2019s really where our primary focus, if we did something with a regulated entity at this point, we would become more unregulated and that\u2019s not the direction that we are going. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Gregg Orrill with Barclays. Please go ahead. Nick Akins : Good morning. Gregg Orrill : Yes, thank you. Good morning. Two quick questions. First, if you have any update around timing of merchant sale how you are thinking about that? I know you said you expect Ohio PPA order soon after the briefs are done. And then second on the O&M slide, the $2.8 billion for \u201816, ex-riders and trackers, maybe is that a fair assumption to kind of back into what that is from \u201815 and assume that continues or maybe provide some guidance around what that is for riders and trackers? Thank you. Nick Akins : Yes. I will let Brian cover the second one. On the first one, on the merchant sale piece as you talked about, I think the timing is still, as I said earlier, we need \u2013 it\u2019s sequential in terms of outcomes, but not sequential in terms of the activity that\u2019s going on. We are already in a strategic process around the unregulated generation. The question is what\u2019s in and what\u2019s out? So, we will get through the PPA approach with Ohio. Hopefully, they will make a decision here and it should be after over 2 years, be in a decent decision to make a decision quickly. And then we know and understand what we are dealing with, with the rest of the fleet. And so that process we would expect would move very quickly and I would expect us to be in a good position to get that done as quickly as possible as well and that is a focus to make sure that we complete that activity in 2016. Brian Tierney : Gregg, this is Brian. A little bit over $1 billion in offsets that we are talking about in terms of trackers. And in terms of how we get there from \u201815 to \u201816 in O&M it\u2019s employee-related expense. It\u2019s one-time reductions that we will be doing and we have been planning for the reduction in capacity revenues in Ohio now for the last 3 years. So we have had as a management team, our focus on the fact that they go away fully in 2016 so whether it\u2019s lean initiatives, procurement initiatives, one-timers that we are doing, some of the benefit that we got in 2015, we are able to move expenses out of \u201816 into \u201815. We have really been very, very focused on maintaining that O&M discipline for the first full year of no capacity revenues in Ohio and it\u2019s all those initiatives together that are allowing us to get to that $2.8 billion level. Gregg Orrill : Thank you. Operator : Next question is from the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Nick Akins : Good morning, Paul. Paul Ridzon : Good morning. Just wondering what you are seeing as far as buyer interest out there? Are you still talking to private equity? This would be for the non-PPA assets? Brian Tierney : Well, we have had to be really careful with that obviously. We do have an ongoing process and I would not be surprised if private equity involved with that, because they are interested in that kind of business. But I probably should stop there, because obviously, that\u2019s an ongoing process. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead. Nick Akins : Good morning. Paul Patterson : Can you hear me? Nick Akins : Yes, yes. Paul Patterson : I am sorry, okay. I wanted to touch base to you on two things. Just first on the non-PPA merchant plants, just I apologize if I am a little slow on this. What is exactly the decision process on them? Nick Akins : So, once we get past the PPA part of the approach, then on the rest of those assets, it really is centered around number one valuation, because these, we feel, like are really competitive units and ones that positioned well in the marketplace. So if there is an opportunity to understand what the valuation of that is. And obviously, there is ensuring that there are parties involved that are interested in those assets. And so we will go through that process very quickly. And there is \u2013 certainly, there is an opportunity there. But we obviously want to understand what the economics look like for that kind of transaction and what it means to our business going forward. And this is not a share of sale. So we are going to be very mindful about what it means to our shareholders in terms of not only in terms of any potential dilution if that exists or what we do with the proceeds. It\u2019s just as important as the question of what you do with the assets in sales. There is a multitude of different things that we have to think about in that process. As you know, we are in a pretty good cash position, capital position right now. And to go through that process or it could be more cash associated with that. So we have to really think about just as much on the use of proceeds and obviously what it does to shareholders as well. So we will go through that process and really that\u2019s the nature of it. And it\u2019s a relatively simple process for the set of units. Paul Patterson : Okay. And then with the [indiscernible] energy what have you challenge that was made at FERC regarding the waiver, they want the waiver rescinded regarding the affiliate PPA, what \u2013 do you guys have any comments on that? Nick Akins : Yes. We feel pretty strongly about our position. And obviously, they perceive that maybe they didn\u2019t think we would even get this close to getting the PPA done. And we have PPAs now. We have got PPAs for solar in Ohio. We have OBEC generation that\u2019s under a PPA. We have got in other regulated jurisdictions and there is no difference between those activities and what we are doing here. And really, it centers on the notion of whether there is customer choice or not. And in fact, FERC has said before the customer choice does exist in Ohio. Leads us up to Ohio determines the mechanism under which that proceeds and there is precedence for that. So we feel pretty strongly about our position. I think as far as FERC is concerned, it\u2019s asked and answered. And I think when you look at the case that\u2019s been filed, I would presume they proceed of trying to address it there when they may be have difficulty addressing Ohio and we have had a case for 2 years where they could have been involved with that and our settlement is, keep in mind, we have a settlement with a lot of significant parties in this case. So yes, there are some on the outside looking in and they are going to do what they need to do. But the settlement of the parties exists. It\u2019s a good settlement. And certainly, it\u2019s one that addresses the Ohio issues and that\u2019s what we are about. I don\u2019t know, they have their own motivations about what they want to achieve. But we are wanting to achieve consistency from a pricing perspective for consumers protection, for consumers for a sliver of their energy needs. But customers still have the ability to choose in Ohio. They can choose any supplier. So \u2013 and that has not changed. So I think we feel good about it. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Ali Agha with SunTrust. Please go ahead. Ali Agha : Thank you. Nick Akins : Good morning Ali. Ali Agha : Good morning Nick. Nick, I wanted to clarify points you have made earlier. So as you are looking at these sales of the non-PPA merchant assets, we are looking at a market where commodity prices are down, the valuation on public equity merchant power stocks down significantly. So how big of a concern is that and I mean is that a scenario where if the price is not right you stay back and you keep this or strategically as you have emphasized to us many times, you want this to be 100% regulated business, just wanted to understand your thought process in terms of how this plays out? Nick Akins : Yes. As we look at this, yes, you could look at the present energy market, present natural gas prices. And a lot of people get hung up on, if prices are high, then the world has changed and there is assumptions about what valuations are to be and when the world is low, there is again 180 degrees different assumptions about how the world ought to be. These decisions are made on long-term decisions and mainly driven by capacity markets. And for buyers of these assets, they are looking at long-term capacity markets and long-term energy prices. And they are making bets based upon where they think those energy prices are going to go. So it\u2019s the same discussion that we would have before. But again, these are a great set of assets. And for anyone, even on a low energy market, you have got to look at margins and margins are what\u2019s driving the valuation. So and then from a capacity market, the same thing. So I think there are so many \u2013 if you look out in the long-term, there are so many issues involved here. There is going to come down to any valuation would be around what someone else perceives the forward curve to be for capacity and for energy and then our version of it and we will see where it goes. But if somebody comes in and tries to lowball us, then we feel pretty good about these assets. They sit really good in the market and \u2013 but our presumption going in is that we will determine the outcome of what we do with these assets. Ali Agha : So just to clarify, Nick, I mean on the one hand, is that a strategic decision made at AEP, look these assets are going in one way or another, we are 100% regulated over the division be more sensitive to valuation as you are suggesting? Nick Akins : There is going in, we plan on being the next premium regulated utility. And that is the strategic driver. Now valuation, obviously we have to look at and make determination, well is the valuation consideration enough for us to move ahead from that perspective. Because keep in mind, I mean you are looking at things like currency value improvement, PE multiple improvement, multiple expansion, what you do with the proceeds, all those types of things that are also part of the evaluation. Because with River Ops, we changed from a volatile earnings stream to one that by reinvesting that cash we were able to focus on a continual, consistent earnings growth stream. And that\u2019s what \u2013 how we are looking at this as well. I mean it\u2019s a volatile. It may be great, it may be positive, but it\u2019s still volatile. And so we have to look at that and determine the balance of that kind of determination versus what we can do with the proceeds and ensure shareholder value on a consistent basis going forward. That\u2019s the way we look at it. So unless somebody \u2013 I mean I don\u2019t think we are going to get any low balls in this thing. I really don\u2019t believe that because it\u2019s a great set of assets. Ali Agha : Understood. Last question, unrelated, just to be clear on the bonus depreciation, so the CapEx goes up in \u201817, \u201818, obviously has positive earnings implications, but more near-term in \u201816, any earnings headwinds from bonus depreciation we should be factoring to our thinking for this year? Brian Tierney : No. Nick Akins : No, we are one of the utilities that has a ready willing and able, remember the transmission graph we always have, the green and the blue on top that we were looking for capital. We found capital. Bette Jo Rozsa : Operator, we have time for one more question. Operator : Your last question is from word from the line of Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead. Shahriar Pourreza : Good morning everyone. Nick Akins : Good morning. Shahriar Pourreza : Sorry if this question was asked. I had to hop on late. But just on the higher CapEx call that you released this morning, just want to confirm, is there still levers to increase that budget under the assumption the you sell the 5 gigawatts, so can you redeploy it, avoid some sort of dilution or are we thinking a little bit more buybacks now that you have already raised you CapEx? Brian Tierney : Sure. So the plan that we have laid out does not assume anything around proceeds of sale from non-PPA assets. So the plan that you have is a business as usual CapEx plan and the things were to change, I anticipate that Nick and I will come out with revised guidance and use of proceeds. Shahriar Pourreza : Okay, good. So, you could reaccelerate further CapEx additions about what we have done today? Nick Akins : All the things that are available for people to do with proceeds or things that would be available to us, we obviously look first to reinvest in our organic businesses and with the incremental cash that we got associated with bonus depreciation that was our first and best use of those dollars. So, they are obviously a spade of other things that are available to us. But you would anticipate Nick and I would come out and tell you what those things would be at that time. Shahriar Pourreza : Got it. Excellent, okay. And then just one last question on the strategic review of the 5 gigawatts, obviously, there is obviously potential buyers here. Is there some optionality in this transaction where you can layer in the other 3 gigawatts if you don\u2019t get the PPA approved? Is that \u2013 is there \u2013 is there sort of that optionality? Nick Akins : Yes, if the PPA is not approved, then all of the assets will be in that strategic evaluation. Bette Jo Rozsa : Okay. Well, thank you for joining us on today\u2019s call. As always, the IR team will be available to answer any additional questions you may have. And Tom, that concludes the call. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. I want to thank you all for your participation and for using AT&T teleconference services. You may now disconnect.",

We will take your questions following their remarks. I will now turn the call over to Nick. Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Bette Jo. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining AEP's first quarter earnings call. Financially, 2016 is off to a steady start that delivered earnings consistent with our plan for the year, so all is in good shape there. It was not without challenges though, we overcame the winter that never happened, and of course, the anticipated changes from 2015 such as loss of capacity revenues related to the Ohio transition order that ended in May 2015, and the loss of AEP River Operations revenue due to the sale that occurred late last year. Positive rate changes, continued benefits of managing expenses and disciplined market hedging activities enabled GAAP and operating earnings to come in at $1.02 per share. This compares with $1.29 and $1.28 per share of GAAP and operating earnings respectively for 2015. The impact of weather was significant for the quarter. Brian will cover this in detail a little bit later, but we had the sixth warmest winter in the last 30 years in 2016. And remember, we're comparing against the second coldest winter in 2015. So considering this difference, I would say we had a great quarter from an earnings perspective that showed the resiliency of our plan for the year and the strength of our foundation for continued growth. We are reaffirming our guidance range of $3.60 per share to $3.80 per share and our 4% to 6% growth rate to further signal our confidence in how the year is likely to shape up for AEP. I'm sure many of you have questions concerning last night's FERC order. So let me put some perspective on that. Obviously, we are disappointed with the FERC decision to review our PPA arrangement under the EDGAR rules based upon the presence of non-bypassable charges, but that being said, we embarked on the best mechanism within the existing Ohio legislation that we felt could withstand legal scrutiny that would allow the Ohio Commission to have a say regarding the long-term viability of resources and the development of new resources within the state. And the positive note regarding Ohio activities during the first quarter is that the PUCO did the right thing. They approved the PPA and not only sent a message regarding investment resources located within the state, but also focused on moving toward a balanced set of resources that included renewable development that would have advanced any potential clean power plant objectives. But FERC has spoken. And unless we have the patience for what could be a lengthy review process by FERC, this option could be off the table. So here is what I want to be absolutely clear about. AEP is moving toward being a premium regulated utility, one that is advancing toward being the next generation energy provider that has a vibrant energy grid with not only a balanced set of generation resources but the technology deployment of tomorrow to enable a clean reliable and affordable energy product to our customers. We have no interest in getting involved in a protracted FERC state jurisdictional dispute. So we will move as expeditiously on Plan B as possible to resolve any uncertainty regarding our being the next premium regulated utility. So this is a two-prong approach that will be pursued in parallel. So we can still meet our objectives as quickly as possible. Number one, we already have a strategic review that I will update you later regarding the non-PPA assets. We will begin a strategic process for the PPA assets as well. Number two, we'll push for re-regulation in the Ohio legislature to repeal and replace SB 221 or enable the transfer of and cost recovery for certain resources in AEP Ohio, thereby eliminating the need for a PPA. This will secure Ohio's role in determining its own resource mix with a structure that enables long-term and short-term deployment of generation related resources in the state. These two prongs will progress in parallel, and whichever results in AEP becoming fully regulated earliest will be completed. All of these state related issues are occurring out of frustration with organized markets such as PJM that have an inherent inability to allow states to make decisions regarding their own resources. Ohio needs to decide expeditiously, does it want to control its own development of resources within the state, or leave it to PJM in the federal government who have conflicting multi-state interest. Regarding the Ohio Supreme Court decisions, we believe that these two remanded cases should be taken up together at the PUCO because they clearly are interrelated. The first order concerning the capacity charge and the energy credit set by the PUCO, the court said clearly that the AEP should recover our generation capacity cost and that the PUCO erred in its use of the energy credit instead of listen to AEP's concerns. The second order concerning the rate stabilization recovery mechanism said that it was permissible to have deferred capacity cost recovered in the RSR, but not the component of the RSR that reflected transition or financial integrity revenue. All of these together say that the remand to the PUCO requires the recovery of all of AEP's capacity cost. Therefore, once the debt settles on which buckets costs are attributed to, AEP expects the result to be neutral or positive to earnings. The last topic to review is an update of our strategic process, so that you will know where we are at. We have opened a confidential data room. There is considerable interest by several parties and the process is moving according to schedule with final bids in the third quarter and aggressively completing a transaction by the end of the year. Now, at this point I'll move to the equalizer chart on the next page to talk about some of the state regulatory activities. So overall, we're seeing a 9.4% in return. As you recall from the last quarter, it was 9.6%, but we expected it to come down during the first half of the year and then move back up towards that approximately 10% that we had discussed earlier. So everything is still on plan for that. Looking to the Ohio Power, the ROE for AEP Ohio is in line with our expectations and we expect to finish this year in line with the 11.9% ROE forecasted. For APCo, the decrease in ROE from December to March is primarily due to unfavorable weather this winter, 2015 reversal of previous regulatory provisions as well as the performance of the merchant portion of the Mitchell Plant. The 2015 West Virginia base rate case included a delayed billing of $25 million of the annual base rate increase to residential customers until July 2016. So we'll see that start to kick-in. And as they phase in, the company's ROE is expected to trend at or near the 2016 forecasted ROE. For Kentucky Power, we're seeing the expected continual improvement at quarter end. The commission authorized a $45 million rate increase that was effective in July 2015, and this rate case will continue to improve the ROE during 2016 as the year goes on. For I&M, it achieved an ROE of 10.2%. I&M continues to benefit from good regulatory frameworks in place for the major capital investment programs it has going at our Rockport, SCR, solar, the nuclear lifecycle management at Cook and Transmission PJM related projects. So I&M is well positioned for another positive year in 2016. PSO's ROE is generally in line with expectations. In December, as you would recall, the Oklahoma Corporation Commission heard the rate case and PSO implemented an interim base rate increase of $75 million that's subject to refund on January 15, so that's kicked in and we should expect that ROE to continue to improve. SWEPCO, we expect to see some improvement in ROEs from some recent filings, but they continue to be challenged by some of the wholesale revenue that's rolling off there, but also the positive indications are that they're filing an application in Arkansas that went into effect March 24 to recover our retrofit investments in Welsh and Flint Creek Power Plants and then in Texas, we filed Transmission & Distribution riders there as well. In AEP Texas, the ongoing distribution capital investment in TCC to serve higher levels of electric loads and to maintain the reliability of the grid has gradually lowered the regulated ROE over time. So on April 6, TCC and TNC filed distribution cost recovery factor filings seeking recovery of distribution investment from July 2006 through December 2015 with rates expected to go into effect September 1. AEP Transmission Holdco, the transmission side of things, its return is 10.9%, which is in line with expectation. 2016 forecast is 10.2% because of the heavy investments being made there as well. So all in all, it's been a great quarter. I think that the fundamentals are showing through the company, and certainly we have several opportunities and we'll continue to work on those, but it has been eventful, but our employees' discipline and execution toward a common strategic objective is becoming more evident every day. No doubt our progress will continue toward being that next premium regulated utility. And we can't help but saying, because I just got back from the Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony, I'll end with a quote from a famous Rock n' Roll Hall of Fame inductee and it says, you will always tell when the groove is working or not. That was from 2004 inductee Prince. At American Electric Power, I can tell you the groove is working. So Brian, pick it up. Brian X. Tierney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you, Nick, and good morning, everyone. I will take us through the financial results for the first quarter, provide our latest insight on load and the economy and finish with a review of our balance sheet strength and liquidity position. Turning to slide five, operating earnings for the first quarter were $1.02 per share or $501 million, compared to $625 million or $1.28 per share in 2015. At the highest level, the decline in earnings this year was driven by unfavorable weather conditions and the expected decline in earnings in the Generation and Marketing segment due to the reduction in Ohio capacity revenues. These unfavorable drivers were partially offset by rate changes, growth in normalized margins and our regulated businesses, and higher earnings in our AEP Transmission Holdco segment. With that as an overview, let's look at the drivers by segment. Earnings for the Vertically Integrated Utilities segment were $0.57 per share, down $0.04, with the single largest driver being winter weather, which negatively impacted earnings for this segment by $0.11 per share. As Nick said earlier, 2016 was the sixth-warmest winter, and 2015 was the second coldest winter for AEP in the last 30 years. Other major drivers for this segment include the reversal of a 2015 regulatory provision in APCo produced a drag on earnings of $0.03 per share. Off-system sales declined by $0.02 per share due to substantially lower power prices. Higher O&M expense unfavorably affected this segment by $0.04 per share, primarily driven by higher employee-related costs. Partially offsetting these unfavorable items were rate changes, which were recognized across many of our jurisdictions, adding $0.06 per share to the quarter, and higher margins on retail sales, mostly related to the timing of mix of sales, which added $0.04 per share. We will look in detail at load and the economy in the next three slides. Finally, this quarter was bolstered by $0.04 per share from a lower effective income tax rate due to prior-year tax adjustments and tax versus book timing differences accounted for on a flow-through basis. The Transmission & Distribution Utilities segment earned $0.22 per share for the quarter, up $0.02 from last year. This segment's major drivers include rate changes, higher transmission revenues in the Texas companies, and lower O&M expense, each of which added $0.01 per share for the segment. The O&M reduction was due in large part to a contribution to the Ohio Growth Fund made in 2015 that was not repeated this year. Partially offsetting these favorable items is a decline of $0.01 per share related to milder weather in Texas compared to last year. Our AEP Transmission Holdco segment continues to grow, contributing $0.09 per share for the quarter, an improvement of $0.02. Net plant less deferred taxes grew by approximately $910 million, an increase of 39% since last March. The Generation and Marketing segment produced earnings of $0.14 per share down $0.24 from last year. Capacity revenues were lower by $0.12 per share due to plant retirements and the transition of Ohio's standard service offer to full market pricing. Energy margins were lower by $0.07 per share due to power prices liquidating 32% lower than last year. While the trading and marketing organization performed well, it was not able to replicate last year's exceptional results and was off $0.03 per share. Corporate and Other was down $0.02 per share from last year, primarily the result of having no earnings from AEP River Operations due to its sale in late 2015. Despite mild weather, softness in residential sales and power prices, our performance for the quarter was solid. We have been planning for a couple of years to be ready for the capacity revenue challenges in 2016, and our actions and planning leave us well-positioned to achieve our earnings targets for the year. Now let's take a look at slide six to review normalized load performance. Starting in the lower-right chart, our normalized retail sales were essentially flat for the quarter. However, the other charts on this slide show that the growth in commercial and industrial sales has been offset by the decline in residential sales. Normalized residential sales were down 1.6% for the quarter, although we experienced modest growth in our residential customer counts compared to last year. Most of the customer count growth was concentrated in Texas, where favorable demographics support new household formation. This was partially offset by fewer customers in our eastern territory, specifically around the Appalachian Coal Basin. On the positive side, commercial sales grew by 0.7%. This growth was spread across most of our operating companies, which is consistent with the growth in the service sector employment that we experienced across AEP's service territory. Finally, industrial sales grew by 0.9% this quarter. The majority of this growth came from the oil and gas sectors, which I will discuss in more detail later. The growth in these sectors helped offset the drag from the primary metals and mining sectors. The weak global demand, oversupply of Asian steel and strong dollar combined to create challenging markets for export manufacturers within our footprint. Now let's turn to slide seven to look at the most recent economic data for AEP's service territory. Starting at the top with GDP, you see that the estimated 1.8% growth for AEP's service area is now only 0.3% behind the U.S. For the first time since 2014, our eastern territory is now growing faster than the U.S. This was not the case for our western territory where there's greater exposure to lower oil and gas prices. While the nation benefited from lower fuel prices, AEP's regional economies supporting these shale plays are experiencing the negative impact of lost jobs. The charts at the bottom show the employment growth within AEP's service area is holding steady, but still lags behind the U.S. by 0.6%. It is no surprise that job growth in AEP's eastern territory exceeds the western service area by 0.5% given what we just discussed. The sector is showing the strongest job growth for the quarter, include construction, leisure and hospitality and education and health services. These gains were somewhat offset by the decline in natural resources and mining jobs. Today, there are 16,000 fewer natural resources and mining employees working in our service territory than last year. Approximately 12,000 of those jobs were located in our western footprint. Now let's turn to slide eight to review our industrial sales trends by region. As we briefly mentioned earlier, we continue to see the strongest growth in our industrial sales to the oil and gas sectors. The chart in the upper left shows our industrial sales in shale counties were up over 9% versus last year. This is in spite of the fact that oil prices, rig counts and employment in the oil and gas extraction segment were down significantly from last year. The bottom left chart shows that growth in oil and gas sectors was spread across all major shale plays within AEP service territory with the strongest growth coming from the Eagle Ford, Permian and Marcellus regions. The map on the right now includes our coal counties shown in blue. I want to highlight these counties since we are seeing some significant erosion in our industrial sales as well as customer counts in this area. In the upper left chart, our industrial sales in the coal counties were down over 17% this quarter. Low natural gas prices and environmental regulations combined with the drop in metals production and corresponding demand for metallurgical coal have created a perfect storm for Appalachian coal producers. You are likely familiar with the number of bankruptcies and mine closures that have been announced over the past year, citing these exact reasons. Outside of our shale and coal counties, the rest of AEP's industrials were up nearly 1% for the quarter. Some examples of industries that are still seeing modest growth this year include transportation manufacturing and plastics and rubber manufacturing, both of which are tied to auto sales where production benefited from lower fuel prices. Now let's turn to slide nine to review the company's capitalization and liquidity. Our debt to total capital rose by 0.5% this quarter and remains healthy at 53.7%. Our credit metrics, FFO interest coverage and FFO to debt are solidly in the BBB and BAA1 range at 5.45 times and 20% respectively. Our qualified pension funding decreased 3% this quarter to 94%, although plant assets increased by 1.2%, plant liabilities increased by 4.5% due to the discount rate coming in lower than the assumed rate of 4.3%. We plan on funding our pension with about $93 million in the second quarter equal to the estimated service cost for the year. Our OPEB funding now stands at 104%. Plant assets decreased by 1% and plant liabilities increased 4% for the same reasons as the pension plan. The estimated O&M to service both plants this year is expected to be about $20 million. Finally, our net liquidity stands at about $3.2 billion and is supported by our two revolving credit facilities that extend into the summers of 2017 and 2018. During the second quarter of this year, we plan to refinance these facilities with an anticipated tenure expected to extend in the June of 2021. Altogether, AEP's balance sheet, liquidity and credit metrics are strong and will allow us to fund our utility operations, growth and dividends under all reasonably foreseeable conditions. And finally, so we can quickly get to your questions, let's turn to slide 10. I want to reiterate that the first quarter's results were in line with our expectations. In spite of last night's late breaking news, we remain on track to earn within our previously announced operating earnings guidance range of $3.60 to $3.80 per share for 2016. As Nick said earlier, our previously announced strategic review of our competitive generation business will continue according to schedule and we will share the results of that process as soon as we can. We expect that to be in the third quarter. With that, I will turn the call over to the operator for your questions. Operator : Thank you. Our first question will come from the line of Jonathan Arnold of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Oh good morning, guys. Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, Jonathan. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you. Thank you. Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Or good afternoon, whatever it is to you at this point. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: I think it's good morning, but thank you for such crisp comments on short notice. One question I had is that you talked about the plan with the PPA assets to engage in a parallel path strategic review or re-regulation. Is it possible that that strategic review could somehow be folded into the ongoing process around the non-PPA assets, or do you see these as definitely sort of separate track? Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. We're going to start the process obviously with the PPA assets. We don't want to slow down the other assets. So we're still looking at that to see what can be done to address it, but we don't want to slow down the existing process that's going on. We're going to stay on schedule and we're going to continue cranking away and then we'll initiate the process and actually initiating a process on the PPA assets is relatively easy to do because we've already done it for the non-PPA assets. So it can move along relatively quickly as well. The question is you know I mean to all of a sudden roll it in to the existing process, it may be challenging. We'll just have to take a look at that. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And then just to clarify on timing, I think Nick in your remarks you said you'd hope to have a sort of process fully wrapped up for the non-PPA assets by the end of the year. And I think maybe I heard Brian say, you'd update us on the third quarter. So is there a possibility that year-end is the outside date and things happen quicker? Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. I think, obviously, we would want an announcement in the third quarter. And then we'd want to close as quickly as we can and we've been able to close transactions relatively quickly before and it's a known set of assets. So we feel like it may be aggressive, but we want to close by the end of the year. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Can you share when bids are due or anything like that? Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, we have initial bids in a cycle that, I think, occurs during the second quarter and then the third quarter will be final bids. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, great. And then can I just (24:38) sort of the other part of the parallel path? Where are you on this re-regulation proposal? Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Is it kind of standing start or is there some momentum kind of in the background? We've obviously just have the Chairman of the PUC step off the desk or about to. Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: And can you just kind of update us on how you see that and how likely it is that something could really materialize faster than a strategic review? Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. I just probably make a distinction because even before we started the PPA, I said the State of Ohio needs to decide, but I'd also said that the Commission needs to decide and because we were trying to do something within the purview of the existing legislation and it being left out to the difference of the Commission to decide. In this case, we're not talking about the Commission. Now obviously we'd love for the Commission to be part of that process. They need to be part of the process but this is a legislative issue. And our concern is, and I think there has to be a broader concern about the state of Ohio and that's represented by the legislature, what do we do to enable Ohio to take a firm hold of the capacity and energy situation within the state, the development of new resources, the jobs, taxes and all those things that we talked about earlier. And it's not like you're starting at ground zero to do this. I think the issues in Ohio are well-known from an energy policy perspective. Matter of fact, we just got through the review, through the Ohio business round table, the Columbus partnership's been involved. There is definitely already steps being taken. It's a question of, okay, what steps? And there you're talking about, okay, is there a stopgap measure to basically allow the transfer of certain assets within the state of Ohio to AEP Ohio directly and avoid any kind of affiliate transaction, which probably, I would say is probably a better chance of accomplishing something like that and a full re-regulation, but I wouldn't take that off the table either. I mean because I think there's broader issues that are involved here like, for instance, if Ohio wants to move forward with renewables and renewable implementation and balance out the portfolio and focus on natural gas, those are clearly areas that can fall within some form of re-regulation. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Would a transfer like you suggest require FERC approval? Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, but that kind of approval, they've already done before. We already did it for net book transfers from our Ohio, what was our Ohio fleet to other jurisdictions, and they were approved without a hitch. So I think there is probably plenty of precedence on that one. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thanks. Thank you, Nick. That's all and I also want to thanks for your time this morning. Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Okay. Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to the line of Michael Weinstein with UBS. Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, Michael. Michael Weinstein - UBS Securities LLC : Hey, good morning. How are you doing? Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good. Fine. Michael Weinstein - UBS Securities LLC : In the case of let's say total re-regulation, is the Ohio fleet enough to serve returning load, let's say? I mean I'm thinking about the over, I think, a much larger implication that that might entail for the utility, or do you have to build additional generation under that kind of a scenario? Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : So the first answer is, no there's not enough. Secondly, we'd have to deal with the capacity deficiency either through the market or building new capacity. And I think it's a perfect opportunity for the state of Ohio to look at natural gas and renewables to fill out that approach. And as long as Ohio has control in doing that kind of thing, then we're ready willing and able to move that direction. Michael Weinstein - UBS Securities LLC : Have you already been in touch with members of the legislature to begin the process at this point, or basically this is initial reaction off last night's news? Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I'm not going to address that. I think certainly people are aware of the issues with energy policy in Ohio, and there have been discussions relative to the PPA with legislators, and they're fully aware of what the issues are, and it's not a huge stretch for them to ask the question, well, why don't you just re-regulate? Michael Weinstein - UBS Securities LLC : And would it be more accurate to say, this is more like a three-track process where you would go \u2013 re-regulation is track one, and track two might be transferring plants into rate base, and I guess instead of a \u2013 and third is to sell the plants, right, through another process, right? Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. I think we have to look at, and probably do have to have discussions about what is the most expedient process, because I mean there's several options here that we can talk about and some of them maybe stopgaps, some of them maybe longer term. And certainly I think that others in the state will agree that we need to respond quickly to enable us to continue to do what Ohio wants us to do with that generation. And so I'd say we're obviously discussing several options internally among ourselves, but we haven't gone out with specific policy objectives, at least detailed objectives, on how we want to approach it because obviously we want to do what's the most expeditious way to do it. Because in my book, the race is on. The race is on between our option of the strategic evaluation versus our option to have some form of re-regulation coverage. And it maybe a misnomer to call it re-regulation, but we'll have to see what that means. I think AEP has reached the point where it's time to get this resolved once and for all. Michael Weinstein - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks a lot, guys. Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yep. Operator : Thank you. We'll go next to the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, Paul. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Good morning. So just to understand this. If you were to be able to transfer stuff into rate base, that would require legislation, is that not correct? Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. We'd need approval from a legislative standpoint to transfer back into AEP Ohio. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. How long do you think that might take legislatively? I mean how should we think about that as analysts? How quickly do you think that they might be practically able to address something like this? Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. That's probably what we're going to find out, but as far as your timeline, you really ought to be going by our other option of the strategic evaluation. And if we do something earlier, that's great. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay, I got you. So you're not going to wait for \u2013 you want resolution one way or the other pretty quickly, it sounds like? Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, we're not waiting. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : And here's just an idea that \u2013 and if this is crazy, let me know, but what about the idea of \u2013 since this is an affiliate issue at least the FERC order that came out, just simply AEP is assigning the PPA to FE and FE is assigning the PPA to AEP. I've realized that there'd have to probably be some changes, but since PUCO doesn't seem to have that big an issue with it, I mean I'm just wondering is that something that could realistically address the issue, or you follow what I'm saying? Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. I follow what you're saying. I think probably FERC would follow what you're saying too. So I think that would probably wind up being an issue because you know FERC, they hinged their order. I mean it wasn't just an order saying, come in, let's take a look at it. It was basically saying we don't like the non-bypassables and... Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : In the context of an affiliate transaction now. I mean this wouldn't be an affiliate transaction then. I mean I realize it's sort of legalistic, but I mean you guys want to be affiliates at that point? Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. We will certainly look at that option but... Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. I just thought... Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I just don't want to introduce any novel issues that would drive our schedule to be even longer, and I think anything to do relative to FERC at this point most likely would be a longer schedule. So we'll have to look at it and see. I mean obviously we'll hold those kinds of options open, but I'm just trying to say our primary options are number one and number two that I had talked about earlier. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. Thanks so much. Appreciate it. Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yep. Operator : And we'll go next to the line of Anthony Crowdell with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, Anthony. Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC : Hey, good morning. Is it reasonable then, and maybe you don't want to answer this, whether the re-regulation scenario or some type of cost of service return on these assets is like a two-year event, or no clarity on that at all? Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : No. It's not a two-year event. I don't think it's a two-year event. I mean, these issues are well-known, and really, I mean what we asked for Senate Bill 221 if you scrap that and kept \u2013 and it goes back to the previous legislation, then there's opportunities there, or it could be specific issues that are dealt with within a smaller legislation that's sort of a stopgap measure to allow the transfer. And so I think that's a relatively simple thing to think about. Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC : All right, great. And just a quick follow-up. Are there any other instances at all that AEP uses an affiliate waiver that may also be contested? Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : No, I don't think we have anything else there. Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC : Oh, great. Thank you so much for my taking question. Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Operator : Thank you. We'll go to next to the line of Ali Agha with SunTrust. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thank you. Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, Ali. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Good morning. Good morning. Nick, just to clarify your overall thinking on your merchant exposure. I think you said for the non-PPA assets announce something Q3, get it all done by year-end. Is the plan for the PPA assets, whatever it happens to be done by year-end as well, or could this spill into 2017? Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I think realistically the PPA assets could likely fall into 2017, but I wouldn't think far into 2017 because obviously we have to get a confidential data room with all the analysis and all of the things around those units done, but the parties that are interested in capacity and PJM, they're pretty well-known now. So I think there's probably things you can do to shorten the schedule, but I think to get the non-PPA assets done by year-end is an aggressive posture, but doable but I think probably the PPA assets could fall into first quarter, second quarter next year. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Also you said in the past, the PPA assets are the most competitively flattened higher cost coal assets. I mean is one scenario to just throw in the towel and say, you know what, the market isn't giving us the right signal, we don't have any other avenues, we may just shut down this capacity? Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, I think we need more data before we can make that kind of decision. So I think you've got to test the market and who knows, I mean, you could have a strong summer and the whole world changes. So I wouldn't have any conjecture on that at this point. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. And just on the timing perspective, can you just remind us, when does the legislature meet? I mean, what's their schedule. So if it doesn't happen in this current one, when is the next time they meet, just if that is the option that we're going to be also focused on? Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, they can meet anytime. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: I see. Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. They're in session now, but obviously with the presidential election and all that kind of stuff could slow things down, but that doesn't stop you from doing all the education and everything until after the presidential activities are over. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: I see. And fair to say that the FERC coming in that's not done, you're not getting involved in Ohio versus FERC that kind of thing? Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I'm sorry. I missed that question. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: With the FERC jumping in and stopping the waiver, I think, did I hear your comments right that you don't see any avenue there that that's just going to be take too long and that's not a realistic path for that whole process to play itself out? Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, that's fallen back to the third option and really we'll have to take a closer look from a legal perspective, can the FERC process be short changed at all and any provisions that could occur there, but I think FERC is pretty well spoken. We could perhaps ultimately prevail, but it's a long circuitous route to get there unless we can find a way to get a more, a clear and concise and quick response from FERC. So I think that's probably a longer hurdle at this point. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Got it. Last question. Nick, when you look at your company, the premier utility company assuming these merchant assets are ultimately gone. Does 4% to 6% still look like the realistic growth target or could you look at a perhaps even higher target given the growth that your Transmission business is showing for the next several years? Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. So I think we'll probably give you some more insight on that in November at EEI, but it's clear that we are reaffirming the 4% to 6% for now, and then and you see the utility growth that's occurring. I mean we show those numbers too. So once we're fully regulated, we'll give a view of what that looks like going forward as well. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thank you. Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Operator : Next we'll go to the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc. Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, Paul. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Good morning. Is there any potential if you get expeditious re-regulation that there might be better value in putting some of non-PPA assets into rate base? Are those \u2013 ? Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. I don't know really. We don't know the answer to that at this point, because the assets that were in the non-PPA side of things, they were natural gas assets primarily, and the market has certainly valued those assets. So we'll have to look at the numbers and responses. We'll know that pretty soon. And then we'll be able to tell you. But at this point, I think it's just conjecture to assume that but we'll be looking at all the options, don't worry about that. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: And who is the data room, is it private equity, is it strategics? Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. There's plenty of parties that are in the data room. I just wouldn't want to go any further than that at this point. They'll become known pretty soon. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. If we can move out of Ohio and go a little further south. Louisiana is going to talk today about their tax items. Any insight would you expect to come out of that? Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. So from a Louisiana perspective, I think, it's really taking a step out there to start to deal with the phantom tax issue. Texas has dealt with it before and that obviously was taken care of. West Virginia the same thing. So, unless Louisiana wants to be unique from every other jurisdictions, but that if they do choose to do something like that, then they're going a very different route. And obviously there's no ex parte communications in Louisiana. So we'll obviously be having discussions about all that with our commissioners. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: You have not had a discussion... Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Brian, anything you want to add? Brian X. Tierney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : No. Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Okay. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thanks for the update. Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yep. Operator : We'll go next to line of Gregg Orrill with Barclays. Gregg Orrill - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks. My questions have been asked and answered. Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Gregg. Thanks. Brian X. Tierney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Gregg. Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, good morning, anyway. Gregg Orrill - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yep. Good morning. Operator : We'll go next to line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, Michael. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Want to focus on the core business actually and looking at slide four, are you seeing degradation? If I were to look at the same slide for the last year or so, are you seeing some degradation, I mean I'll use a handful of examples. PSO, AEP Texas, SWEPCO, pretty big subsidiaries, numbers appear potentially heading the wrong direction or have headed the wrong direction there. Can you give a little more detail about the dollar rate increase request at SWEPCO and AEP Texas? When you expect those to go in and what kind of impact you expect that to have on regulated returns in both markets? Brian X. Tierney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. Let me start with Texas first. TCC and TNC, we've recently filed the distribution and cost recovery factors there. And those requests are TCC about $54 million, TNC about $16 million in terms of when we expect them to come in place, to propose effective date for both of those is September 1st of this year. And so the effect of those increases will come in, in this chart over the course of the following 12 months in that regard. In SWEPCO, we also have a Texas TCRF that's in and we've requested an increase of about $4.9 million, a very small average customer increase. In addition, we've had a SWEPCO distribution cost recovery factor, where we've requested another about $9.2 million. So very much trying to take advantage of the relatively quick recovery mechanisms that they have with the cost recovery filings that are short of a full rate case in the Texas and trying to get those increases reflected as quickly as possible to help get some of those Texas and SWEPCO ROEs moving in the right direction. In PSO, we've implemented a rate increase, effective January 1 of this year, subject to refund and are expecting an order out of the Oklahoma Commission sometime this quarter. And again that should have that PSO ROE moving in the right direction, up closer to the upper 9%s, closer to 10% range. Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : And keep in mind, Michael, some of this is deliberate too. I mean, like transmission for example, I mean we're spending a lot of money there and obviously it is a great recovery mechanism, but we're still chasing the recovery mechanism because we're investing so much. And in the other jurisdictions, you know we are following rate cases to catch up in certain areas. But all-in-all I mean we look at it like; we're managing these across the board. So some may be you're seeing drop a little bit but there may be specific reasons for that that we're investing in or that we expect rate making aspects to come around at some point, but we're making very deliberate choices. And even during the first quarter, I mean we didn't cut back on our planned O&M or any of those activities because it's the first quarter. Generally you'd have to say that, yeah probably if you looked at it two years ago, you know we were probably at 10.3% that we estimated for the year but you're still in that 10% area. And that's where we try to manage this thing to ensure that we're meeting that threshold across the board. So you know I wouldn't be looking at SWEPCO, for example, I'm saying. Well that's the general trend for everyone. We've talked about the specific issue at SWEPCO and it's that Turk piece, the 88 megawatts of Arkansas that we really need to resolve, but timing is going to be an issue there. Brian X. Tierney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : You know the equalizer chart that you referred to on slide four Michael is very much a heads-up display for us. And when we see those lower ROEs, we are either taking action or have taken action to try and get those improved. And you see that across the board whenever you see those bubbles or balls there whatever you want call them, getting in the lower end of the range. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Okay. And I want to follow-up and I know it's a small subsidiary for you, but if I look at Kentucky earning 5.5%, you've got nine months of the rate increase already in effect right now. So you've only got one more quarter of the rate hike coming in. Just curious, what do you do structurally or process-wise to get that closer to a normal earned to return level? Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. So in Kentucky, we're likely to be making another filing. So when that occurs you'll continue to see that improvement as well. So I sort of look at Kentucky like the little engine that could, because we get some progressive things out of Kentucky like the cyber rider that we had, and obviously it was our first jurisdiction we were able to do a transfer to. So, there are some benefits of being in the Kentucky jurisdiction, but you have to look at this thing in the overall context, it is a small bubble but it's one that's on the uptick from an ROE perspective and we'll continue progressing that way. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Last question. What is the, at the regulated subs, especially T&D and the Vertically Integrated Utilities. What's in guidance for O&M growth year-over-year? Brian X. Tierney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : It's either flat to down, Michael. It's that trend that we've had going back to 2011 to have it be between that 2.6% and 2.8% range and we're right about in the middle of that throughout 2016. Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : About 2.9% yeah. Brian X. Tierney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : 2.75% really. And Michael that's non-bypassable non-offset O&M, okay. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Yep. No. Understood. Just trying to check in on that, because O&M can have a big impact on earned returns as well. Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yep. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Thanks guys. Much appreciate it. Brian X. Tierney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to the line of Praful Mehta with Citigroup. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hi, guys. Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, Praful. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thanks for taking my call. And sorry to go back to the PPA aspects, but looking on the non-PPA, I'm a little confused with the timing and the sequencing. Because if your goal is to get an exit quickly on the non-PPA asset, but you also want to attempt to try to re-regulate, I just don't see how the timing works because if you want to just sell the assets you've probably got to execute pretty quickly rather than wait to try and re-regulate. Could you help me just understand how the timing could work there? Brian X. Tierney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So there's two different things here. I mean, the non-PPA assets are part of the process that's already ongoing. And that process is already in play. There's already confidential data rooms. There's already a review going on. There's all kinds of things going on with that transaction, and really the schedule is pretty aggressive, but we're going to get it done. The - Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Sorry I meant the PPA assets. I was trying to - Brian X. Tierney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Okay. So the PPA assets, obviously we're going to have to do the same thing there in terms of getting a lot of data associated with that. Now just think about \u2013 the original non-PPA assets are plants that are wholly owned, there's no partners, there's primarily natural gas, which is pretty easy to evaluate with Gavin obviously, and Gavin is the piece that people have to take a look at as well. With the other set of assets, I'm sure, we've got to get a lot of data and information together for them to present them in a positive way to ensure that potential investors can look at those assets and give them time to do that. So we wouldn't want to slow down the existing non-PPA for that. And you can only move so quickly with those kinds of transactions, particularly as it relates to the existing PPA assets, but we'll start the process. We'll move as quickly as we can, but I'm just trying to be realistic in that it will take a little bit longer than the existing schedule we have for the non-PPA. And now what it also says is, is that the re-regulation or anything, any potential option thereof is going to have to move very aggressively. And so we don't have any time to spare on that, because I think that \u2013 but I'm just saying that that's not the critical path. On the critical path, we have two projects : one, the existing non-PPA, and then now we have the existing PPA assets, and we're going to move as quickly as we can. There's been a lot of homework done on it, lot of analysis done on it. So we don't have to do any of that and recreate it, but we've got to make sure our process is robust enough so that people can understand probably a more complex set of resources. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Fair enough. Got you. That's very helpful. Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yep. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): And just secondly for both the assets, PPA and non-PPA, could you just remind us, given there's a little bit of timing difference, but broadly both are going to be sold. If that's the base case, could you just remind us in terms of the tax basis or the tax leakage expectation, if any, and the use of proceeds, if it's just going to be for reinvesting in the Transmission side or you're also going to do some share buybacks? Brian X. Tierney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So we've not shared the tax basis on those assets. And really the use of proceeds discussion would be likely timed to when we would announce what a transaction would be, but we have a great opportunity to reinvest in our organic business with those proceeds, as you saw us do, when we had a \u2013 bonus tax depreciation got extended, we're able to increase the CapEx for 2017 and 2018 by $1 billion immediately, most of that going into the wire side of the business, but more a fulsome discussion on what we would do with use of proceeds would likely be at an Analyst Day following the announcement of the resolution of that strategic review. Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : What I can tell you is we're very mindful of is that we have a whole laundry list of potential places to put any available cash that comes in. You named one of them, obviously transmission, which we have substantial ability there. There's other things on the list that we continue to invest in, not only the operating companies but also on the competitive side with purchase power arrangements. So those are opportunities that we can continue to develop in anticipation of cash proceeds coming in. But what I want to make sure of is that, we're not going to just get a pile of cash and have it burn a hole in our pocket and we wind up doing something stupid. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Got you. Very helpful. Thank you, guys. Operator : We'll go next to the line of Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim. Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Good morning, everyone. Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning. Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Most of my questions were answered, but just on the legislative route. I know it's not probably the primary route you want to take, but this is probably the first instance that I can remember that all the utilities seem like they're unified within the state. So when you're sort of thinking about taking the legislative route, is this something you're going to collaborate with, with your neighboring utilities, and has this sort of been a preliminary discussion? Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. I think our interests are consistently aligned because there's a problem, and everyone knows there's a problem. And for some probably, it's more of a problem than others, but it's still a problem. So we're going to continue to address it, and you'll have to ask Chuck at FE and others, what their thoughts are, but I would venture to say that our interests are aligned in many ways from that perspective because there is a problem. Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Got it. Okay, good. And then just lastly, not to drill another parallel path here, but is there an option to hold a competitive RFP process for the PPAs and allow the other gencos to bid into this? Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, I guess the question is, is there enough capacity? I'd just have to take a look at that. Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Got it. Okay, good. And then just lastly here bypassable... Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Let me just say this, though... Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Yeah. Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : ... I really don't want to get to a point where we have 10 options that we're evaluating, because I think it's pretty clear what we need to do. Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Got it. Okay, great. And then just I probably know the answer to this, but a bypassable route on the PPAs is not something you'd want to take up. Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, that is an option but we'll have to investigate it and see what actually that means for the company financially but that is an option that has been initially discussed, but whether that prevails or not, we'll just have to take a look and see. Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Excellent. Thanks so much, guys. Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yep. Operator : Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Jim von Riesemann of Mizuho. Please go ahead. Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, Jim. James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Good morning. How are you? Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Just fine. James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: I have a couple of, just like semantics types questions. So the Ohio legislature is supposed to end in mid-June. When is the last date to submit a bill? And do you need to have a bill submitted in order for the government to call a special session? Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : We'll have to take a look at that. I don't know. Do we have any of our... Brian X. Tierney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : No deadline... Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, okay. So there's no deadline for legislation being introduced. James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Okay, okay. And then I guess the second question is, if you go this route and this whole FERC process doesn't work out, are you still subject to the refund that they discussed in the order yesterday? Brian X. Tierney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Nothing's been collected yet, so there's nothing to refund. James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Okay. Brian X. Tierney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : But their refund order stays in effect if we were to begin collecting, but given what they said about the waiver, we can't begin collecting because we can't implement the PPA. So there's nothing to refund. Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : We weren't collecting until... James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Just making sure. Brian X. Tierney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. We weren't collecting until June 1, so, I guess... James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Yeah. I was just making sure. Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. No problem there. James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: And then totally different topic. Do you have any comments or thoughts from the Senate Energy Bill that has been passed there and needs to go to reconciliation? Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. I think certainly Senator Murkowski has been working very hard to get bipartisan support for the bill has energy efficiency provisions, has provisions for the grid in terms of certainly the focus on making sure the grid is reliable. I think that's a good bill. And obviously, it has to go to conference and Fred Upton has been working on the other side on the House side. So they'll have to put those two together and they're very different in some respect. So we're going to have to work through that process, but overall, though, anything that Congress and the Senate can do to come together from a bipartisan standpoint to focus on reliability of the grid, integration of all these activities that we are having to deal with is a good thing, and I think it's a good start. Now, there's some heavier lift issues that eventually will need to be addressed but you got to start somewhere, and I think Lisa Murkowski has done an incredible job \u2013 I think it's Cantwell on the other side of the aisle \u2013 but it's good to see. James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Is it premature to discuss what sort of impact it might have on your company, the bill, in terms of incremental CapEx? Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : You know even for what it's doing in terms of things like renewables, I mean I think it would be potentially more wires investment for us, which we've been very effective at implementing to enable solar and wind development. I mean I think it's only an upside at this point. We haven't quantified what that is yet Jim. James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Okay. Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : But we think it's the positive opportunities for us. Brian X. Tierney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I certainly don't think it's anything we're concerned about. James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Okay. That's what I was going after. Thank you. Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Bette Jo Rozsa - Managing Director- Investor Relations : Operator, we have time for one more call, one more question. Operator : And that will come from the line of Michael Worms with BMO. Michael Simon Worms - BMO Capital Markets (United States): I made it. Thank you. Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, Michael. Michael Simon Worms - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Good morning. How are you doing? Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Just fine. Michael Simon Worms - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Nick, I think with regard to potential for re-regulation, I believe you've indicated earlier that there is not enough generation to meet load. And so I guess the question would be under such a scenario, what would the impact be to the consumer in terms of building out the system to meet the load relative to what the market pricing is today under the current environment? Nicholas K. Akins - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Well, we haven't neither created nor destroyed capacity out in the market. So there may have to be interim solutions of capacity to get through until the state can actually decide what does an integrated resource plan look like for the state going forward. So the capacity is probably available but because we transferred our capacity as well and retired capacity, we'll need to make sure we have a plan to recover from that. I think from the customer standpoint, to put new capacity in place or buy existing capacity that's out on the market, would be a positive thing to provide certainty in terms of their bills in the future. And I just see a very volatile future for Ohio customers and usually that volatility happens at bad times, where customers can here afford to be able to pay a bill, I think. The utility sort of focus, as particularly an integrated utility is sort of a big budget biller. And when you open it up to market forces, the budget biller is not in the game anymore. So I think there's value in that. Michael Simon Worms - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Great. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. Bette Jo Rozsa - Managing Director- Investor Relations : Thank you for joining us on today's call. As always, the IR team will be available to answer any additional questions you may have.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we\u2019ll conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded. And I\u2019ll turn it over to your host, Bette Jo Rozsa. Please go ahead. Bette Jo Rozsa : Thank you, Sean. Good morning everyone and welcome to the second quarter 2016 earnings call for American Electric Power. We are glad that you are able to join us today. Our earnings release, presentation slides, and related financial information are available on our Web site at aep.com. Today, we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors. Joining me this morning for opening remarks are Nick Akins, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Tierney, our Chief Financial Officer. We will take your questions following their remarks. I will now turn the call over to Nick. Nick Akins : Okay, thanks, Bette Jo. Good morning everyone. Thank you once again for joining AEP\u2019s second quarter 2016 earnings call. AEP had a strong second quarter with GAAP and operating earnings coming in at $1.02 per share and $0.95 per share respectively, bringing the year-to-date earnings to $2.04 per share on a GAAP basis and $1.97 per share on an operating basis. This compares favorably to the second quarter 2015 GAAP and operating earnings of $0.88 per share. The 2016 year-to-date earnings compare unfavorable to 2015 primarily driven by the significant weather and energy market differences experienced in the first quarter of 2015 versus first quarter 2016 as we reported last quarter. These results clearly keep us on pace to meet our operating earnings guidance range of 3.60 to 3.80 per share, which we are reaffirming. We\u2019re also reaffirming our 4% to 6% growth rate, so overall steady as she goes quarter with a discipline and consistency that our investors have come to expect from AEP. Our focus on the utility operations, transmission growth, expansion of our customer sales channels, process optimization and the disciplined deployment of capital and O&M expense continues to drive positive results for our shareholders and customers. While externally it may appear to be a relatively calm quarter, there has been substantial activity internally that further demonstrates and direction of AEP and its strategy to be the next premium regulated utility. We recently established a Chief Customer Officer role assumed by Bruce Evans our former AEP Texas President that provides a focus on improving our customer's experience. This organizational redesign will focus on addressing the evolving nexus that exists between the regulatory framework, emerging technologies that enhance the customer experience and deploying the analytics in technologies of the future to address resource needs and to optimize smart grid applications. As we progress with the substantial build out of transmission and distribution to accommodate large scale optimization and renew of the grid along with the development of additional sales channels that provide growth, we are emerging as an energy company that provides solutions for our customers through both the classical regulated envelop that provides universal access and tailored solutions for customers. AEP's culture is one of openness, collaboration and innovation and I have no doubt that AEP when focus on the investments in the largest transmission system in the U.S. and the energy grid tomorrow will continue to evolve to be the next premium regulate energy company. Also during the second quarter, we continue our strategic review as the comparative generation, keeping in mind we now have two tranches of generation, the first of which we\u2019ve called the non-PPA assets for lack of a better term, which essentially is the natural gas units and the Gavin coal station. The process for this tranche is going according to plan and continues beyond initial bids that were received in the second quarter with final bids due in August. I can say that the response has been robust and we are confident that the process will move toward the conclusion of the strategic review in the coming months. We have also began the planning for the disposition of any cash proceeds to ensure an earnings trajectory that replaces lost earning as quickly as possible. This could include some ramp-up capital spending in transmission and other actions that we\u2019ve done previously and that the cause of immediate recognition of PTC benefits, one business we are currently ramping up is our investment in the long term solar arrangements as well. The second tranche, the previous referred to PPA assets or in the initial phase are preparing assets for process much like the non-PPA assets. This process will occur in parallel with our focused efforts toward restructuring in Ohio. We will be discussing these issues and implications in more detail during the coming months, leading up to November EEI. To follow up on the Ohio restructuring discussion for those of you who don\u2019t know several of our company's sites have showing up in the latest craze of Pokemon Go. One of those sites was our turbine sitting in front of our 1 Riverside Plaza corporate headquarters, the virtual reality of a Pokemon next to our generator turbine in Ohio made me think that, it may be good for a game but if the generator was virtual we might have a real problem on our hands and that is where Ohio is heading if it depends too much on federal markets that do not value the long term base flow generation. I want to look at PJM website, pjm.com to review the generation mix of the peak during the warm days we have been experiencing lately. The vast majority of capacity at the time of the peak is delivered by coal and nuclear resources that are not valued properly in the market construct. Moreover, these markets do not take in account the other issues that are of State concerned such as placing the generation, balance portfolios, jobs, taxes and other state issues. These markets including PJM need to be improved to adjust to these realities. With FERC\u2019s order essentially taking the Ohio PPA proposal approved by the Ohio commission of the table, which I discuss last quarter, AEP is addressing the situation by pursuing restructuring in Ohio. Note this is restructuring, not re-regulation. Our proposal for legislation is now being discussed with various stakeholders and involves the ability or transfer existing generation and invest in new generation such as natural gas and renewables by AEP Ohio. The proposed legislation strikes a balance between our ability to invest and maintain generation in the state and the customers\u2019 ability to choose generation suppliers. This overall process would allow AEP Ohio to move forward with the transition of generation resources in a responsible way that would benefit the State of Ohio and AEP and its customers. The legislation would address any potential FERC jurisdictional matters while allowing the state to take control of its own resources as well as any transition envisioned under initiatives such as the clean power plant. In the absence of restructuring legislation, AEP will continue with its strategic process with the second tranche of generation. We continue to analyze the load situation our service territory shale gas load just tailed off in recent months along the course with mining while industrial load has dropped, commercial and residential load increased, so from quarter-to-quarter the last several years have overall been a mixed bag and hard to read, much like the economy in general. Brian will address the load related issues in more detail in a few minutes. Moving to the equalizer chart on page four that shows our various operating areas, our overall ROE continues to improve as we mentioned last quarter, it's now at 9.8% versus 9.4% that we reported last quarter and still expect as a move toward our forecasted 10.1% overall ROE for 2016. So, all is moving according to plan. So here is the story for each of the regulated business units. For Ohio Power, the ROE for AEP Ohio is at the end of the second quarter it was 13.3%. We expect it to be more favorable than the forecasted 11.9% at the end of the year. The improved ROE forecast is primarily due to AEP Ohio receiving a regulatory order related to the PIR, the phase in recovery writer that allows us to recover accumulated deferred fuel costs with carrying charges as approved by the commission in the ESP 1 case and also 21 million increase in retail margins due to our regulatory reversal and a provision that occurred and then a favorable annual PJM transmission formally rated through us. So AEP Co Ohio Power is doing very well at this point and we continue to expect. AEP Co, the increased ROE is primarily due to a one-time recognition of deferred billing in West Virginia as approved by the public service commission of West Virginia in June of 2016. The 2015 West Virginia base rate case included delayed billing of 25 million of the annual base rate increase for residential customers until July 2016 as these revenues phase in the company\u2019s ROE is expected to trend near the 2016 forecasted ROE. AEP Co does continue to monitor reductions in industrial and residential load, particularly in the cold depressed areas of the state, we\u2019re watching that very closely. Kentucky Power we\u2019re seeing the expected continual improvement at quarter end. The commission authorized a 45 million rate increase effective July 2015 and this rate case will continue to improve the ROE in 2016. And also they are continuing to watch their economy as well. I&M achieved an ROE of 10.1%. I&M continues to benefit from reasonable regulatory frameworks in place for those major capital investment programs that we have in the state generation such as Rockport, the solar projects, nuclear with a loss cycle management and transmission projects as well. So I&M is well positioned for another positive year in 2016. PSO its ROE is generally aligned with expectations, Oklahoma\u2019s economy continues to experience a slow down due in large part to low oil prices and reduced oil and gas activity in the state. In December 2015 the Oklahoma Corporation commission heard the rate case and PSO implemented an interim base rate increase of 75 million subject to refund in January of 2016. So final commission order as expected on that in the fourth quarter. SWEPCO 2016 revenues were challenged by the weakness in oil and natural gas price system, wholesale revenue is rolling off, also wholesale customer's exercise options for sell generation or market participation, but we filed an application in Arkansas that went into effect March 24th, to recover our retrofit investments at Welsh and Flint Creek and then in Texas we filed Transmission & Distribution writers there as well in that state. So we continue to make various filings in those states to improve the ROE. In AEP Texas, the ongoing distribution capital investment, AEP Texas to serve higher levels of electric load and maintain the reliability of the grid had gradually lowered the regulated ROE over time. The ROE should continue to improve however due to the recently approved $56 million DCRF settlement that will going into effect September 1, 2016. And that\u2019s a Distribution Cost Recovery Factor, for those of you who don\u2019t know what DCRF is. AEP Transmission Hold Co, the transmission Hold Co's return of 11.7% is outperforming the 2016 forecast of 10.2%, the increase in ROE is really focused on a true up, an annual true up that occurs in the transmission formula. So we expect that ROE to come down during the year, but still expect it to be around 10.7% by year end. So that\u2019s a known and measurable processes that we\u2019re going through there. So overall, 9.8% continues to track upward and we are pleased with the progress that the operating companies have made. So overall, another great quarter for AEP, this quarter has been a continued approached by AEP to ensure consistency discipline and execution to provide quality shareholder value. It's hard for anyone from outside of AEP to see the company I see from inside with the dedication and innovation of our approximately 18,000 employees. So I\u2019ll just put it this way, I happen to play drums in a band at an event in Cleveland last week where we backed up the Marshal Tucker Band. We played some Bruce Springsteen and it's still on my mind, so I\u2019ll just end up by just saying, Baby we were born to run. Brian? Brian Tierney : Thank you Boss and good morning everyone. I\u2019ll take you through the second quarter and year-to-date financial results, provide our latest insight on loan and the economy and finish with a review of our balance sheet strength and liquidity position. Turning to Slide 5, operating earnings for the second quarter were $0.95 per share or $466 million, compared to $0.88 per share, $429 million in 2015. Overall the increase in earnings was driven by rate changes including the reversal of our regulatory provision and lower O&M in our regulated utilities, and higher earnings in our AEP transition Hold Co segment. Both of which were partially offset by the expected decline in the generation of marketing segment. Earnings for the Vertically Integrated Utilities segment were $0.42 per share in the second quarter to both 2016 and 2015. Lower O&M due to decreased planned outage expenses and recovery of incremental investment to save our customers were offset by lower margins on retail sales and decreased off-system sales margins due to lower energy prices. The transmission and distribution utility segment earn $0.25 per share for the quarter, up $0.09 from last year. This segment\u2019s major variances included the reversal of the previous regulatory provision in Ohio adding $0.03 per share, and higher margins on retail sales which added $0.02 per share. Other favorable drivers each adding a penny per share where rate changes higher ERCOT transmission revenue and lower O&M expense. Our AEP transmission Hold Co segment continues to grow contributing $0.19 per share or the quarter, an improvement of $0.06. The growth in earnings reflects our return on incremental investment and includes the impact of the annual true up for the formula rate mechanism. Net plant investment less deferred taxes grew by approximately $840 million, an increase of 32% since last June. The generation of marketing segment produced earnings of $0.09 per share down $0.07 from last year. Capacity revenues were lower by $0.07 due to plant retirements and the transition of Ohio to full market pricing. Energy margins were lower by $0.03 per share due to power prices liquidating 18% lower than last year. On the positive side, the commercial organization in our competitive business performed well and wholesale trading and marketing was favorable by a penny this quarter. Corporate and other was down a penny from last year due to higher O&M expense. Let\u2019s turn to Slide 6, and I will briefly highlight our year-to-date results. Operating earnings through June were $1.97 per share or $967 million compared to $2.15 per share or $1.1 billion in 2015. The details are on the slides for those of you who\u2019d like it, but overall the decrease in earnings was driven by the expected decline in earnings in the generation of marketing segment, less favorable weather conditions in the first quarter, depressed power prices and the disposition of our river business last year. These unfavorable drivers were partially offset by rate changes, a change in the effective tax rate, growth in normalized margin and increased earnings in our transmission businesses. Now let\u2019s take a look at Slide 7 to review normalized load performance. For both the quarterly and year-to-date comparisons the message is the same. Our normalized retail sales were down compared to last year because the increase in residential and commercial sales was more than offset by the drop in industrial load. In the lower right chart, our normalized retail sales were down 0.4% for the quarter and 0.3% year-to-date. For both periods, the strong sales performance in our Texas territory is being offset by weakness in the Appalachian and Kentucky regions. This illustrates the benefit of geographic diversity. Normalized residential sales in the upper left rebounded in the second quarter and are now essentially flat compared to last year. Through the first half of 2016 our residential sales, customer accounts and normalized usage were all essentially flat. In the upper right commercial sales grew by 1% for the quarter and are up 0.8% year-to-date. This growth was spread across several of our operating companies, although the strongest growth occurred with the T&B utility segment. This is consistent with some of the economic data I will share with you on the next slide. Finally industrial sales dropped by 4% this quarter and are down 1.6% through June. The sustained drop in energy prices, weak global demand and strong dollar have combined to form a challenging environment for manufacturers. For the quarter industrial sales declined in seven of our top 10 industrial sectors. The two sectors that grew in the second quarter were pipeline transportation and transportation equipment manufacturing. The petroleum and coal product sector was flat for the quarter. I\u2019ll provide additional color on our industrial sales later. Now let\u2019s turn to Slide 8 to look at the most recent economic data for AEP service territory. Starting at the top with GDP, the estimated 1.3% growth for AEP is only 0.3% behind U.S. The upper right chart shows that our Eastern territory is not only growing faster than our Western territory but is now exceeding the U.S. This is not the case for our Western territory where there is greater exposure to lower oil and gas prices. Depressed energy prices have created a noticeable slowing in our western footprint. While the nation benefited from lower fuel prices, AEP's regional economies supporting these shale plays are experiencing an impact of lost jobs. The charts at the bottom show that employment growth for AEP is holding steady of 1.1%, but still lags behind the U.S. by 0.6%. It is not surprising the job growth in AEP's eastern territory exceeds the west given what we just discussed. Earlier in the presentation, I mentioned that our commercial sales were the strongest in our community utility segment that matches the employment data for our service territory as well. Over two thirds of all jobs added in 2016 have been in Ohio and Texas. The sector is showing the strongest job growth for the quarter include construction, leisure and hospitality, and education and health services. These gains were somewhat offset by the decline in natural resources and mining jobs. Today, there are 22,000 fewer employees in that second than last year and approximately 15,000 of those jobs were located in our western footprint. Now let's turn to Slide 9 to review our industrial sales trends by region. Over the last several years our industrial sales growth has largely been tied to oil and gas activity around the major share plays. Up and to this quarter, sales to the oil and gas sectors have been fairly resilient despite low energy prices. The chart in the upper left shows that the tide has started to turn. AEP's industrial sales in shale counties this quarter actually decline by 0.3%. Specifically the decline is largely coming from our upstream oil and gas extraction sector which experience to 6% decline for the quarter. The map on the right identifies our coal counties shown in blue. I want to highlight these counties since we continue to see significant erosion in our industrial sales as well as customer accounts in this area. In the upper left chart, our industrial sales in the coal counties were down 14% for this quarter, while sales to the mining sector alone were down nearly 18%. Low natural gas prices, environmental regulations, lowered demand from the utility sector and less demand globally from metallurgical coal have created a bad situation for Appalachian coal producers. Outside of our shale and coal counties, the rest of AEP's industrials were down 3.3% for the quarter. Now let's turn to Slide 10 to review the company's capitalization and liquidity. Our total debt to capital ratio crept up by 0.3% during the quarter and remains healthy at 54%. Our credit metrics, FFO interest coverage and FFO-to-debt are solidly in the BBB and BAA1 range at 5.6 times and 20.2% respectively. Our qualified pension funding remained unchanged for the quarter at 97%, although plant assets increased during the quarter, so did plant liabilities due to discount rate coming in lower than assumed. During the month of June we funded about $86 million to plant assets and amount equal to the estimate of service cost for the year. Our OPEB funding now stands at 101%. Plant assets increased by 0.2% but plant liabilities increased 3.1% due to drop in discount rate. The overall impact dropped our OPEB funding ratio by 2.9%. The estimated after tax O&M expense for both plans this year is expected to be about $13 million. Finally, our net liquidity stands at about $2.3 billion and is supported by our two revolving credit facilities. During the second quarter, our treasury team worked with our banking partners to amend and extend our key credit facilities. We now have a $3 million facility that extends into June of 2021 and the second $500 million facility that expires in June of 2018. This tiered structure allows for maximum flexibility as we continue our strategic review of our competitive generation assets. Altogether, AEP\u2019s balance sheet, liquidity and credit metrics are strong and will allow us to fund our utility operations, growth and dividends under all reasonably foreseeable conditions. Now let's turn to slide 11 and wrap this up, so we can get to your questions. We are pleased with our earnings results for the second quarter of this year. Gains in our wires businesses more than offset expected decreases in our competitive businesses due to lower energy prices and deregulation in Ohio. As we look towards the second half of 2016, we believe that our regulated businesses will more than offset any challenges presented by our generation and marketing segment, giving us the confidence to reaffirm our operating earnings guidance range of $3.60 to $3.80 per share. Finally, as Nick mentioned earlier, the strategic review of our competitive generation remains on track and we hope to have news for you in that regard either later this quarter or early next quarter. With that, I will turn the call over to the operator for your questions. Operator : Thank you [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is going to come from the line of Greg Gordon from Evercore Finance. Please go ahead. Greg Gordon : Looking at the numbers, the quarter was obviously great, but the sales trends in industrial are a bit concerning especially if you just extrapolate them out, on a compounding basis. I\u2019ve heard some concern from investors just around the ability to meet the 4% to 6% earnings growth aspiration if in fact the sales growth targets that you laid out when you laid that target out a year or so ago failed to materialize. Sort of you aspired to a premium utility, the premium utilities don\u2019t blame changes in the outlook for not meeting their growth rates. So, how do you aspire to a nice plan to time if industrial sales continue to be a drag on the plant? Nick Akins : I think the last four years have shown a couple of things, one is the inconsistency of load from quarter-to-quarter and obviously we\u2019ve had to work through that. I think the other thing in the last four years has shown us we have to adjust to it. And when you think about the levers that we have around O&M, but also have emerging revenue sides as well. I mean the transmission continues to pick up, there is no question. We\u2019ll have to continue to invest in the grid, in particular transmission as well. And then we also have other investments like solar and those kinds of relationships with customers that are improving earnings as well. So I think when you look at the 4% to 6% we\u2019re still confident in the 4% to 6%. And as we go through the year we\u2019ll certainly be able to fine tune that in more detail, but I guess the overall message is we feel like we have the ability as we\u2019ve done in the last four years to be able to compensate for any of these issues that occur. And there is no question, I mean, any business has to adjust based upon what the sales forecast looks like, but also they got to look at the revenue side as well and ensure that we\u2019re doing everything we can do there to do its work as well. So Greg I know there is a lot of concern out there about load forecast going forward, if we trend it out. And of course what we do to irregular generation, but at the end of the day we are going to adjust to it And I think we take very seriously the consistency that we\u2019ve build and maintained over the last four years and we don\u2019t interim on giving that up. Greg Gordon : All right, that\u2019s great. Also when I look at the balance sheet, you guys have sort of ascended to a position of having one of the strongest parent balance sheet amongst what I consider your utility holding company peers, if you look at the FFO-to-debt metrics, to debt EBITDA and that. You\u2019ve got a lot of balance sheet capacity. How do you think about that store value and how you might use it going forward? Nick Akins : Yes, we look at stored value, it's gives us a lot of opportunity, but we have the ability to invest indigenously within our own footprint and we also from a transmission standpoint and other revenue producers that we\u2019re working on to really define that, whether it's an energy company of the future or whatever you want to call it. But there is no doubt that we have built up a strong balance sheet with great credit metrics. And obviously we intend on maintaining that but at the same time there is the ability for us to look at various options for the use of that debt. And it's actually a good place to be in, but also in this day and age and how the economy of doing and what's going on there it's a good place to be. Brian Tierney : Gregg, you know this management and you know how we use that balance sheet capacity in the past. It's been on prudent regulator type utility investments and I think you\u2019d expect us to spend any of our balance sheet capacity on a similar way going forward. Greg Gordon : Great thanks guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Anthony Crowdell from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Anthony Crowdell : Just two questions, first question I guess on Ohio, you\u2019ve had another utility in your state apply for regulated plan. Looks like it\u2019s going to be a wires charge to grow got to make a more of a robust grade. Does AEP make a similar filing giving that staff has recommended that? Nick Akins : Yes, ultimately we can also do that, I think that\u2019s an option for us to do. But AEP is sort in a different place. We have some outstanding issues, that we\u2019re working through with the commission, the perk [ph] that we just got was one of those. But we also have the Supreme Court cases on capacity, they will come back, and on the RSR. So we are working through a rest of outstanding issues and each one of those is generally positive for AEP. So we want to work through those and get them resolve, and I think it's a great opportunity for us to do that. And at the end of the day, if that other companies are successful then obviously we will take a hard look at that. But we want to make sure that we are investing in this state and those areas that make sense and we are doing it well from a transmission and distribution perspective. We\u2019ve got to get this generation things settled once in for all. Anthony Crowdell : And then following up on Gregg's question, you mentioned you guys have a strong balance sheet, highlighted all of that capacity have, you\u2019re going through the changes of the generation and marketing segment right now. Southern\u2019s call yesterday highlight the success at Southern Power, refining all these renewable projects. Do we see the generation marketing business for AEP in the year or two looking more like a southern power with a lot more renewables, is that going to be the focus as we go forward? Or is it just really managing the fleet or just winding it down and adjusting the wires company or regulated company? Nick Akins : No, I think clearly and we\u2019re probably little more quiet about it because the major part of our business is around infrastructure, infrastructure development on the transmission side. We have a huge transmission system, so we have a lot of ability to invest. But you\u2019re always looking for sources of new revenue and we see it as another tool in the tool box to be able to focus on enhancements of earnings because obviously there is near term benefits of a protection tax credits, and we\u2019re after doing that.  We just did a universal scale or utility scale project in Utah that hasn\u2019t been announced yet. We can\u2019t say who but it's a 20 megawatt project. And then we also have several other small projects with municipalities and so forth in New York and other locations around the country. And we\u2019ve been doing that and we know how to do that. What we really are focused on though is ensuring that we do have a place to deploy our capital in the wisest fashion and that can certainly augment our business, but our main focus is the focus on the infrastructure and what it means. And it goes beyond solar. It goes to relationships with customers and I sort of alluded that in my opening discussion, we have a much broader relationship with some of these customers that goes beyond solar, it goes to obviously renewables with storage. We\u2019re very focused on storage aspect. Our investor in Greensmith for example, integration of solar and wind, but also in energy storage. And you see those applications coming together from a distribution standpoint and that\u2019s going to be a huge benefit to us. So, obviously we want to be in the solar business, but we also going to be in the wind power business, it's really addressing tailored needs of customers focused around that customer experience. And so in an ancillary fashion it's coming to pass, but we\u2019ll probably be getting larger at it, but we\u2019ll good at it and we\u2019ll be focused on ultimately those customer experience side of things. Anthony Crowdell : My last thing is, just to make sure I understand this correctly, it looks like you\u2019ll look at multiple opportunities, maybe to bridge the gap on GenCore [ph] marketing and one of those maybe like a solar ITC bridge there. Is that correct, or that\u2019s not what you said? Nick Akins : Yes, essentially that\u2019s right. But at the same time we want the earnings driven by the utility business to drive that consistency. Well, if you\u2019re able to augment with long-term purchase power arrangements, whether it's solar or whether it's anything else then it's qasai regulated that we can show consistency and that\u2019s what we -- that\u2019s the first thing we measured on. So we\u2019re not out there doing solar just for solar sake or solar with counterparties that we\u2019re not sure that they\u2019re going to be there or not. We\u2019re being very selective about what solar projects and what counterparties we become involved with and I think and certainly Chuck Zebula who is running that business, I think probably all know him, he is very structured in the way he addresses these things just like he did with even a lot of this un-regulated generation. We performed extremely well in doing that business regardless of whether we should be in it or not, that\u2019s another question. But when we do it, it's very disciplined, it's very structured and it's very focused on what we are trying to achieve. So you\u2019re exactly right. For us -- I mean if you look at the use of proceeds, if we have catch proceeds coming in from a transaction, then obviously one of the issues that we talked about earlier was repurchase of stock. But obviously if you can invest in a long term solar project and take the PTCs upfront, that\u2019s also a great measure for investment as oppose to buying back stock. So there is a lot of thing that are on the table that we\u2019re preparing as we work through the process of that disposition of cash for example. So I think to be the energy company of the future, you\u2019ve got to be involved with all these facets of the business and understand that facet of the business, but you got to be very disciplined in your approach. And we just have a -- I wouldn\u2019t say a different view in terms of whether all of these resources, there should be a balance at our resources, we agree on that. I think the issue is we are very focused on the wires piece of it and how it interacts with the customer and in the future you are going to see a lot of these distributed solutions that are driven by the customer interaction at the distribution level and we are going to be there to do it. Anthony Crowdell : Great thanks for taking my questions. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from line of Julien Dumoulin Smith from UBS. Please go ahead. Julien Dumoulin Smith : So quick follow up if you will on the just process here, when you thinking about the legislative effort whether restructuring or what have you, when do you make a final call here? You kind of talked about it in this quarter, early next kind of making a vision on the sale. Is this the potential for you to stretch in next year to try to get it done given kind of the limited window on legislation this year? Nick Akins : Yes, let me give you an idea of this my perception of the timing. We have the framework of legislature that we\u2019re addressing with stakeholders now and that\u2019s -- whether it's legislature, whether it's other that are important to in discussion process, other participants in the market, those kinds of things. We are going to focus on that between now and November. And then November is when the Ohio legislature comes back into place. And keep in mind, I am talking about the first tranche of assets, this is really regarding the second tranche which is, what formally was the PPA assets. So the first tranche, that\u2019s moving along, it's already -- the train\u2019s left the station and it\u2019s moving forward. The second tranche, I am saying from the restructuring standpoint, we\u2019re going to go through and have the legislature and have discussions with stakeholders to get that process in place in November when Ohio, the legislature comes back into session. It will be a lame-duck session. So we will have to make sure that we focused on those legislatures that will still be around and the future leaders of that organization. And then that way we can hit the ground running with legislature that\u2019s already been by and large embedded and discussed in the first quarter by the first of the year. So in the first quarter you\u2019re starting with the new legislature, I think we going to know pretty quickly whether people are open to the possibility of this kind of thing happening or not. And at that point in time, we have already started our secondary process as I talked about around the PPA assets, getting the data room ready, all that kind of stuff. And we\u2019ll make a determination of where we think Ohio is going to go. Ohio many people didn\u2019t think the PPA would happen in Ohio and it did happened. And I still think there is going to be some form of restructuring in Ohio because there has to be. But the question becomes; number one, are people receptive to it; number two, is the time frame appropriate for what we\u2019re trying to achieve. The driver here will be that secondary process and we\u2019ll have to get some determination as to whether the openness and the collaboration in the State of Ohio would work to get something done during the pendency of all that. So that\u2019s where we\u2019re at. And so when we think about that you\u2019re probably taking the decisional process in the first quarter of next year that we\u2019ll know whether Ohio if there is a chance of moving forward with that thing or not. And so that will tell us what we need to know. Julien Dumoulin Smith : And then just to keep going with that continue, you kind of alluded to new investment as well. And I am just curious, even if you pursue the sales do you pursue legislation next year to open that door as well? And to that end what kind of generation and how do you envision that today? Nick Akins : I\u2019ve made it very clear in the state that we\u2019re not going to investment in the generation in this state, period. Until something is resolved from restructuring standpoint that enables us to invest and do it in a wise fashion. And the legislation includes the ability for AEP Ohio to not only transfer those assets that were under the PPA to AEP Ohio, but also to be able to have a mechanism for investment in future generation. And obviously the State of Ohio is very interested in getting natural gas going. There is a lot of discussion about -- there is three or four natural gas units getting built, but that\u2019s locally inadequate of what the Ohio load actually is. And so there is a capacity deficiency in Ohio and if Ohio wants to take advantage of additional natural gas build out, the additional structural addition such as pipeline infrastructure, electric transmission infrastructure, the economic development follow-on to all of that, there is no reason for Ohio to give that up and so there has to be a mechanism to do that and that\u2019s what we\u2019re after. Julien Dumoulin Smith : And just to clarify, is renewables as well in the legislation, and obviously kind of a hot issue this year? Nick Akins : Yes renewables as well and we\u2019ve had discussions, some -- there is different opinion on when, there is different opinions on solar, most are for solar, some are against wind. But I think there is dialogs to where we can probably reach some happy medium. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Michael Weinstein from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Michael Weinstein : Just a follow up to Julien\u2019s question, you had mentioned that this is not reregulation restructuring and I am just curious about what the -- why the de-emphasis on reregulation and what pushed back do to you see if that term was used or proposed? Nick Akins : I think reregulation has the kind connotation that everything is going to be slammed back into the wires company and there won\u2019t be any ability to shop and other participants can\u2019t participate in a market. So we are focused on reaching that balance of the ability for the utility to invest, but also others to invest as well, and customers to be able to. So that\u2019s really the distinction. Re-regulation just as a large to the connotation to it and it actually is a much heavier lift to put entire Genie back in the bottle. Michael Weinstein : Right, so I guess it's a spectrum of possible options, one where you can have everything put in, one where we you have only certain assets like the PPA assets and then perhaps maybe on the other hand of the spectrum might be only -- to allow the utilities only to invest in new asset. I know that\u2019s something and might happen? Nick Akins : Well, that\u2019s not our preference obviously. And that\u2019s going to be determined on the second tranche of generation for sure. Our intension is to make sure that we can transfer these assets back into the large company, and enable the ability for to continue to invest in new generation in a creatable fashion. And it will take a legislative mechanism to do that and we also obviously want to make sure that we accommodate other participants in the market in some fashion and that\u2019s part of dialogue. But those two things are what we\u2019re after. Michael Weinstein : Okay, as a reinvestment possibility of the solar investments that you were talking about. How big do you see that getting in terms of contributing to the 4% to 6% growth rate and versus let's say the transmission Hold Co growth that you are forecasting for that segment? Nick Akins : Yes, so we plan on updating that at EEI in November, particularly as it relates to \u201917 and beyond. We know where it is for this year and it's been pretty good. It's a -- 15 million to 20 million has been added for this year, so those projects is a the huge pipeline of projects and I think you\u2019ve probably heard others talk about, there is a lot of solar projects out there but we are going to pick and choose the ones that match up to what our degree of risk is, and we want to make sure that that business continues to grow, but we are going to be very disciplined in order to approach. So we will have more on that at EEI in November. Michael Weinstein : Great, look forward to see. Thank you. Nick Akins : And it's not that -- it's what we\u2019re doing with wind power and with energy storage as well. And it could be even more defined energy service relationships as well. Michael Weinstein : Right. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Paul Patterson from Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead. Paul Patterson : Just in terms of tax audit, could you elaborate a little more what happened there, and if it's going to maybe impact tax rate going forward? Brian Tierney : Yes, so it's should not impact tax rates going forward at all. So it was a favorable federal tax adjustment related to a settlement of a federal tax audit issue, where we had a tax valuation allowance recorded in 2011. And talk about how is legacy an issue, this is -- that was related to litigation that stemmed out of the Enron bankruptcy. So we are going back pretty far in history, these things take a long time to work their way through the IRS and ultimately a congressional committee and that\u2019s what happen on this, so it's great to get that resolved and behind us, but don\u2019t expect anything like that to be a recurring item. Paul Patterson : And then on the reregulation or restructuring. Just to make sure I understand, it sounds like you\u2019ll be in a -- I wasn\u2019t clear as to whether or not November, the Lame-duck session was when things might be clear to you? Or what that meant in terms of whether something actually might happen then, or whether you\u2019re really looking at the first quarter of 2017? Nick Akins : So I am thinking -- okay. So it really is more of a soaking period because what we want to do is in November we\u2019re talking to the other stakeholders and come to the legislature with what we believe is a balanced package that other participants in the market can latch onto as well. If we do that then the discussion we\u2019ve already had with legislators, we\u2019re trying to get to every legislator we can, that we know is going to still be around and then that would be -- November we\u2019ll get an early indication of where things are going. But really nothing -- I am not expecting anything can happen until the first of the year when the new legislature comes in. But obviously we\u2019ll know who is coming in, so we can have that soaking period from November to December and then in earnest move that legislation forward. I know that\u2019s aggressive but what we\u2019ll be looking for is really the feedback that we get in terms of not only whether it can get done or not but in terms of timing, it will be an important consideration for us. So, I don\u2019t see legislation actually getting done until first quarter or second quarter of next year. But if we know it's coming and we know what\u2019s entailed in it, then we can plan for it. Paul Patterson : And then when you mentioned stakeholders, are we talking about other merchant generators and the reason for the question is that, as you know it seems that unless their generation is included or what have you, that there is this sort of -- we emit [ph] sort of take no prisoners like no, no, no, no, no, on anything like restructuring or what have you because of the fear that they might not be as competitive if you follow me? Is your participation something critical here, or how should we think about the stakeholder [indiscernible] you mentioned? Nick Akins : I certainly think that they are part of the equation and certainly we want to be able to accommodate as much as we can, the investments that have been made in the stake of some of these independent power producers. And keep in mind I mean they can still have PPAs because they\u2019re not affiliated, so there are opportunities for them to actually confirm earnings in the period where obviously being an independent power producer is not a good time to be in that business right now. So, I am not going to go into who we\u2019ve been having discussions with or anything like that, but I would have to say that they are an important part of the puzzle here. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is coming from the line of Paul Ridzon from KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Paul Ridzon : Can you just once again review the priorities for the proceeds from the non-PPA assets? Nick Akins : The proceeds for the non-PPA assets -- so that process will go forward and the priority will be, we will look at as much ramping up as we can do relative to transmission investment and another types of investments to fill -- to make sure that the earnings come in as quickly as possible. Obviously solar could be a piece of that as well. And we are obviously looking at other measures that we can do to invest more quickly to address the level of cash that\u2019s coming in. So we will obviously fill in more of the detail of that in November as well. Brian Tierney : Paul, we would like to be able to come out and have an Analyst Day when we do have something to announce on that strategic review that\u2019s underway and we would have a discussion of that that time. Paul Ridzon : Thank you and you indicated that the process is proceeding fairly -- I think you characterized its going well. Can we use kind of duke Ohio assets on dollar-per-kilowatt basis, is that kind of -- is that a reasonable proxy? Nick Akins : Paul, I don\u2019t want to tell which ones -- which assets to use, I think with your knowledge of the industry you could probably come up with something that would be reasonable for what those would be, other have, somewhat missed it terribly. But I think the smarter people like you in the industry can figure it out pretty readily. Brian Tierney : I think, as I mentioned early we have a robust set of bidders, so I hate to give a mini guidance at this point. Paul Ridzon : Understood. And that\u2019s 5,000 megawatts from non-PPA? Brian Tierney : Yes. Paul Ridzon : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Steve Fleishman from Wolfe research. Please go ahead. Steve Fleishman : Just clarity on timing of the non-PPA outcome? Nick Akins : So from a non-PPA piece, as we get final bids in August, it will probably take -- it could be third quarter early fourth quarter to have a completed deal that we would announce at that point in time. And then the process would occur relative to closing and that could fall into 2017, but obviously the deal will done and we\u2019ll get to closing. So in likely it will take -- once the deal is done, it's could take around six months, maybe nine months to actually close. Steve Fleishman : Okay. And then also just you mentioned kind of some of weakness in your coal country subsidiary facilities, and are you planning to get rereleased in those areas or given that they\u2019re depressed, like is there other ways that you might be able to find solution there? [Multiple speakers] doesn\u2019t seem like the politicians want to find a way to invest in new things in these areas? So I am just curious how you\u2019re thinking about that. Nick Akins : Paul there are couple of things going out -- I am sorry Steve, in Kentucky in particularly we just had some rate relief and we are looking at when it makes sense for us to go back. But in Kentucky in particular to governor\u2019s office is looking at ways to trying track a new businesses and retain the businesses in those areas that are negatively impacted by what\u2019s happening with coal and we from an economic development perspective are certainly working with the governor and the state legislators to try and see we can be a productive part of that. Nick Akins : And Steve keep in mind too we\u2019ve converted some of the coal to natural gas as well. So the big Sandy side is converted to natural gas, Clint Rivers is converted to natural gas. Those are operational now and you\u2019ll probably see more natural gas build out, but also on the renewable side you will continue to see expansion from that perspective. And as Brian mentioned we\u2019re actually have been working, our economic development people have been working with the states to present these sites as brownfield sites for manufacturing and industrial. So we\u2019re working to try to reinforce those service territories as much as we possibly can. Steve Fleishman : Thanks. Nick Akins : I\u2019d say though that there is a -- I mean a lot of damage that\u2019s been done to coal country, there is no question about it. And whoever gets elected in this process really needs to focus one way or another on reinforcing a hugely depressed area. And each one of them has their own way. I mean Hillary Clinton wants just do several billion, focused on rehabilitating from a jobs perspective and that kind of thing. That seems like a longer term issue. And of course Donald Trump is on the other side saying he\u2019s putting the miners back to work and I don\u2019t know exactly how that works. But either way I think both of them, they really ought to be focused on reinvigorating that part of the country, since it's been so devastated by what\u2019s happened recently. Bette Jo Rozsa : Operator, we have time for one more call. One more question. Operator : Thank you. Our next question then will come from the line of Ali Agha from SunTrust. Please go ahead. Ali Agha : Just to bring closure to the overall merger portfolio the exit here. So if I am hearing you right, the non-PPA assets announced late Q3, early Q4 takes six to nine months to close from there. The PPA assets, will you have something to announce in Q1 or are you going to follow the legislative process and maybe that spins over into Q2, not wide clear on when the final closure happens on that portfolio? Nick Akins : I think you read that right. We\u2019re going to have to gauge the receptivity from the legislature that comes into play at that point in time and we\u2019ll have a lot of groundwork already done. So we\u2019ll have a good feeling I think about first quarter or where this is going to go. Now, if it -- and keep in mind that second tranche is continuing in parallel. So, we\u2019re not slowing down on that. What we\u2019re saying is we\u2019re going to gauge that first quarter and you may get an announcement from us that if we\u2019re not sensing that it's going in the right direction in Ohio then we\u2019ll say we\u2019ve got the second tranches, it\u2019s moving along and we\u2019ll give an update to that. If we see that legislation can get done then there will be an expectation to get that legislation done as quickly as possible, but we\u2019ll have to continue, we\u2019re in the tranches until we know for sure that legislation is going to happen. So, I would say you\u2019re going to hear something from us first quarter, perhaps the beginning of second quarter, but I believe in first quarter you will hear from us, some very significant policy around that. Ali Agha : Okay. And then second, given on a low trends have played out through the first half, are you still sticking to the plus 0.9% target for the year, or should be adjusting that? Brian Tierney : As we do an update, being half through the year and looking at where we have been year-to-date. We anticipate being closer to flat by yearend versus 2015. Ali Agha : Okay. And last question, when we look at the transmission growth profile you have led for us the Trans Co business for 2019, that\u2019s going well above 4% to 6%, it's becoming a bigger piece of your overall earnings as well. So when you look at this company beyond the mergers, so just on a regulated basis, and if your PNB et cetera grows pretty much in line with everybody and the transmission grows the way it is, might we be looking at an overall portfolio that has a growth rate north of 4% to 6% just looking at those kind of numbers? Nick Akins : So we are going to provide a more fulsome update on longer term growth rate when we will get together after the announcement of the conclusion of the strategic review of the asset. We would like to have an Analyst Day when we go into all that, sort of reset growth rate if it's time to that and take a look at use of proceeds if that\u2019s what we\u2019re facing at that time and give you more fulsome view hopefully later this -- in the autumn this year. Nick Akins : So without answering, which we\u2019ll answer obviously later in the year as Brian said. We have really, we\u2019ve really brought up the kind of company this is going to be in the future and that will be one driven by transmission, distribution, focus on wares and the convolution of resources and energy services associated with that. So it's going to be a very, very good company going forward from a consistency basis, but also from an investment standpoint and what we\u2019re are investing in. I think it will position us very well for the next 100 years. Ali Agha : Right. The regular business should pretty much be growing with your rate base investment, is that fair? Nick Akins : That\u2019s fair. Ali Agha : Okay, thank you. Bette Jo Rozsa : And thank you everyone for joining us on today's call. As always the IR team will be available to answer any additional question you may have. Sean, would you please give the replay information? Operator : Yes, thank you.

    "content": "\ufeff Nick Akins : Good morning, everyone, and welcome to today's Analyst Day. AEP really thought about the approach that we'll be taking during this Analyst Day, and it really is focused on the future. As you've probably seen from the two press releases this morning, those press releases are very much focused on, not only our Third Quarter Results, but also focused on the future in terms of where we plan on taking this company, so very happy to be able to focus on that further today. Obviously, our story's around growth and innovation, focused on infrastructure development, and the customer experience, which we\u2019ve talked about previously, but also very much so consistency and quality of our earnings. And I think you're going to see, in the process, we really focused this company on the firm foundation, a firm financial foundation, which continues to exist, and also being able to invest in the right things, as you see from the capital plan, that's going to be extremely important for us in the future to deliver consistency and quality of earnings to our shareholders. Some I'm going to do the clicker here, and everyone's familiar with the safe harbor statements, so you could read that at your leisure if you like. But also, as we look at the program today, we wanted to take a look at several areas, and we have some executives here today that focus on specific areas of growth and expectations of the company going forward. We'll have those leaders here today to answer questions that you may have about the future in terms of their parts of the business, but obviously it's a change for AEP to be able to address these types of issues as opposed to focusing on some of the concerns that we\u2019ve had to deal with in the past. And I'll get into that a little bit later where we've addressed those concerns and really repositioned AEP for a positive future. So we'll have Brian Tierney. Obviously, he'll be up, as CFO, to talk about the third quarter results and also talk about some of the capital allocation plans that we have and expectations around credit metrics and those types of things to show that we do have a very, very firm foundation, one that really is positioned for growth. And as he gets into the details of some of those activities, particularly around capital allocation, you're going to see, we are very much focusing our investment on those things that will produce that consistency and quality of earnings. Lisa Barton will be up here as well. She leads our transmission area. And everyone has questions about transmission. I think one of the things that we talked about today in the release, $17.3 billion of investment over the next 3 years, and over 50% of that investment is in the transmission area. So you might think of AEP as a transmission company that has several distribution companies and ability to grow indigenously that others don't have, and I think that's a unique quality about AEP that we'll be talking about today. And then, Bob Powers, our Chief Operating Officer, who heads up all of the utilities as well. He'll be talking about the investments we're making at the utilities and the focus that we have on delivering expectations from a jurisdictional standpoint, to ensure that we are spending on the right things that customers actually value in those jurisdictions. And then Chuck Zebula will be up here. You all know Chuck. Chuck has done a masterful job of running our energy supply business. He's been responsible for the disposition of our unregulated generation assets. So he'll talk about that and answer any questions you may have. But I think as far as the future is concerned, we're very much focused on the adoption of renewables, focused on that part of the business, and as well delivering customer experience levels of operations that really focus on what customers truly want, and he will be talking about that as well. Here is -- there\u2019s a famous quote, I think it\u2019s unknown in terms of origin, but it says a lot about the releases that we just did. And it says, when you stop chasing the wrong things, you give the right things a chance to catch you. And I think when you look at AEP, we have been very much focused on trying to issue -- trying to really focus on the issues that have hampered us in the past, and what you\u2019re seeing today in the releases that have occurred, in the actions that we\u2019ve taken, we\u2019ve de-risked the corporation dramatically and really put processes in place to ensure that we\u2019re able to invest in the right things and invest in those areas that can produce that consistency and quality of earnings. So I\u2019m very happy with where the company is positioned today and where we\u2019re going to be going in the future. There\u2019s no question that we have a firm foundation and the ability to invest in those things that make a lot of sense to the future of not only American Electric Power, but the industry as well. So as I look at our previous statement about, and we\u2019ve heard it repeated several times from investor analysts as well, being the next premier regulated energy company; that\u2019s been what we've been focused on for years now, actually. For the last four years, we\u2019ve been taking steps one at a time to really focus on being that next premier regulated energy company that you can really invest in and ensure that consistency and quality of earnings. Well, I\u2019m going to go through some of the steps that we\u2019ve taken, and we\u2019re changing the notion from here going forward. And that is, we\u2019re going to be -- let me go back here, the premier regulated energy company, because I think we\u2019re there today. Now that we\u2019ve really refocused our business, focused on de-risking components of the business that people have had concerns about, we\u2019re now in a position with a firm foundation to make those investments and really be able to adjust as we go along because the mechanisms we have in place today have been borne out of the challenges we\u2019ve had in the past, but has made us better in terms of allocation of capital, in terms of all those areas to be able to adjust and that\u2019s why we\u2019ve been able to provide consistency and quality of earnings over the last four years even during turbulent times. I can\u2019t imagine what we\u2019ll be able to do without the overhang of some of these issues in the future as we go through and make the investments that we truly want to make and investing in the future and investment in technology, investment in the customer experience that we believe is very valuable. So let me just go over some of things that we said we would do and it was really focused around three areas. Obviously, we had a lot of questions about the strategic review of the competitive assets. We have gone through a process, a systematic process, and I know it\u2019s been slower than some had expected, but there had to be conditions in place that were conducive for us to be able to achieve the objectives, and we\u2019ve taken our time doing it, but we\u2019ve done it in a way that we thought was as expeditious as possible given the conditions we were dealing with, and we\u2019ve actually gone through the process in a very disciplined way not only in terms of the River Operations area that we sold a couple of years ago, now we are in the process of selling a part of the unregulated generation that we\u2019re very happy to be almost through with that strategic process, associated with those resources, and as well as you know, this morning, we took an impairment on the remaining resources, and I'll get into that in a little detail as well. But as we look at those investments, those -- the remaining overhang investments that had the volatility associated with the business, the exposure to the capacity in energy markets, those are areas that we wanted to make sure that we minimize as much as we could and as quickly as we could. So we've actually, I think we've done a great job of adjusting to that. Now let me talk a little bit about the restructuring issues in Ohio. Those remaining unregulated assets still remain in the Ohio footprint. And those are things that we're trying to achieve a more forward-looking view. From an Ohio perspective, we really see a limitation on the ability for utilities like us who are focused on long-term sustainability and the ability to invest for the long-term to have those pricing signals so that we can invest in new types of generation, whether it's natural gas in the state, the governor's obviously very focused on developing natural gas and as well focused on renewables in the state. And for our utility to being best, we're really positioning this in terms of not reregulation in Ohio, but restructuring in Ohio. And that restructuring is focused on the forward view of being able to invest in the resources of the future within the state. There's no question, there's probably 3 or 4 natural gas units being built in the state of Ohio today. There should be double that, at least double that being built. And that's something that I think we have to really focus on in terms of not only development of those particular resources, but the pipelines associated with it, the transmission associated with it, so that we can continue to invest and by virtue of all that, the economic development activities within the state would be further enhanced. The Ohio Business Roundtable has certainly recognized that, and that's something that we're very focused on working with the governor, their staff and as well the legislators during the next legislative session to get resolved. So as we look at restructuring, it's all around that position of our forward-looking view. And that enables us to continue to invest. Otherwise, we're essentially a wires utility in the state and we really do want to focus on the ability to invest in new generation resources, but we have to have a mechanism to do that. So we will continue to work on the legislative front associated with the restructuring. And as far as the impairment is concerned, we looked at it and obviously, with the sale of assets that have occurred that gave a market value on some of those assets, and as well looking through some of the likelihood of getting any potential excess costs over market or any kind of recovery associated with that, it's probably going to be difficult. And I think it's a much cleaner discussion with the state when you focus on a forward-looking view to replace the earnings that could be incremental to the plan that we've put forward with you. So very, very much focused on that, and we're getting a lot of positive feedback along those lines. As far as reinvesting the proceeds wisely, we've reinvested and we're in the process of reinvesting the proceeds of these transactions. I'll talk a little bit about that a little bit later. But as we look at the reinvestment, it's unique in AEP's ability to be able to reinvest the magnitude of the new cash capital coming in and to look at another 2, over $2 billion, whether it\u2019s through proceeds of the sale or bonus depreciation or whatever the case may be, we\u2019ve been able to have a plan to reinvest indigenously and certainly, transmission's a big part of that, but also the regulated utilities are as well. I think we\u2019re in a unique position from that perspective. And we\u2019re very proud of what we've been able to put together in terms of a plan that we feel like is very firm, it\u2019s known projects as we\u2019ve talked about previously, it\u2019s not something that's an aspiration in terms of our ability to reinvest this additional capital that\u2019s coming in, and we\u2019re very focused on doing that over the next 3 years. And then of course, we continue to grow our regulated business, but now, we repositioned the company to take advantage of that growth. We have a really hard growth when it comes to investments in our regulated companies, and you\u2019ll see that with our adjustment to the cone going forward from a growth rate perspective. So AEP going forward, we\u2019re well positioned as a regulated business, there\u2019s no question from our perspective. We see our ability to invest, invest in the regulated companies, invest in regulated infrastructure and as well focused on long-term purchase power arrangements for the expansion of renewables. Those are very positive things from our perspective as long as we can invest, invest for the long term and understand what the return components are going to look like, we\u2019ll be in great shape. Earnings growth rate, further enhanced, we were at 4% to 6% growth rate, we\u2019re now at 5% to 7%. So we\u2019ve increased that growth trajectory, and we see that continuing on out as well. So really, it\u2019s one of the stories of getting smaller to get larger and we\u2019ve really focused on the ability to reposition the company, show the how our growth profile that fully reflects the regulated business and our investments that are being made. So let\u2019s take a closer look at some of the concerns that you\u2019ve had in the past, and I\u2019ll talk a little bit about how we\u2019ve addressed those. So the first concern, number one was our investor focus on the competitive generating assets. Obviously, as we said in the past, we don\u2019t like spending 90% of our time talking about 5% to 10% of the business, and that\u2019s what\u2019s happened over the last four years. Now we don\u2019t have to talk about that anymore. The volatile earnings associated with the competitive generation from the capacity and the energy markets are no longer a concern. So we are very definitely in a position where we feel like we\u2019ve resolved our competitive asset concerns. We\u2019ve resolved that by the sale of River Ops, the sale of the unregulated generation and as well the impairment de-risk of the financial aspects associated with continuing to own that generation until we do go through the process strategically of determining what the future of that generation looks like. Second issue, questions about the use of proceeds, we \u2013 I know there\u2019s a little bit of disappointment that we didn\u2019t talk about the use of proceeds after the last quarter, but keep in mind, with the magnitude of the capital being deployed. We want to make sure we had an absolutely firm plan that we could reassure you that we could take those dollars, reinvest them and really focus on growth for our company going forward. So we will be using all the proceeds from these transactions. And that really is to refocus and redeploy that capital on parts of the business that we find particularly attractive. And the majority of that was reinvested in the transition area. We've said time and time again, we have a long runway when it comes to transition. We have the magnitude of a project management to be able to support the investment in transmission, and that's something, I think that is unique to AEP, that we're able to invest in transmission. And that really has the ability to adjust on an order of magnitude that many others just don't have, so very happy about that. As I said earlier, over 50% of that capital is going to transmission. And keep in mind, when you think about the breadth of AEP transmission, the largest transmission system in North America, 14% of all the transmission investment in this country is occurring at AEP. So if you really want to look at a transmission company, AEP certainly is that. As we look at some of the other areas of concern, and as I mentioned earlier, we've increased investment in transmission. On the renewables side of things, we are looking at long-term renewables. I always ask the question how many states does AEP have operations in, most people say 11 states. If you ask the transmission people, they'll say 13 states because we are also in Kansas and Missouri. The truth is, if we had Chuck's business as well, we're in 30 states. And with those states, we're really focused on those kinds of long-term purchase power arrangements whether it's solar, whether its wind, other forms of renewables, whether it's specific relationships with large customers. That's a great thing for us to be involved with. We have the ability now with that firm foundation that I've talked about earlier to really invest in those types of businesses. We've actually decided to use deferral accounting for that so it continues to be a part of our business as opposed to trying to feed the monster on a continual basis. But keep in mind, our primary motivation is the focus on our regulated companies and our transmission infrastructure and to an extent, generation in regulated jurisdictions that makes sense as well, but also augmented by our ability to focus on these other aspects of the business that Chuck is overseeing at this point. So I think it's really important to see not that a central part of our business, but one that we can be selective and be very focused on enhancing the earnings profile of the company going forward. Next issue. Regulated, non-regulated business mix. There's no question that as we looked at our unregulated business mix, it was definitely an issue for us going forward. We had with the unregulated piece of the business, we had volatility in terms of our forecasting. We certainly had issues with the capacity markets, the energy markets and so forth. So it's been a great opportunity for us to de-risk the company from that perspective. And today, you look at our regulated business, 100% of the capital is being invested in the regulated business, 97% of our earnings will come from the regulated business. So when you look at what's occurring with this company, it definitely is a repositioning that takes out the volatility that focuses on the discipline and the execution around investing in the right things that customers truly value. Customers, and I've said this several times, it's very difficult for customers to value a scrubber or an SCR being built at a coal plant, but they do value investment in transmission, investment in distribution, investment in technology to be able to deploy from the customer experience perspective. Those are things that customers will value. And if customers value it, regulators will value it, and our shareholders will benefit from that. And the final issue is the earnings volatility itself. Our main focus of derisking the corporation has been focused on the consistency and quality of earnings. And we recognized the volatility of waiting for the next capacity market to actually come to fruition what that value would be, what the energy markets do on a regular basis, what happens to the ability to invest in some of this generation that we have to make much harder decisions about from an environmental standpoint and so forth. We really do have to be able to de-risk the business from that perspective, and we've been able to do that. I think when you look at the company going forward, there's going to be predictable earnings and a higher growth rate, and that's exactly what our investors have been -- has been asking for. I can't reiterate enough though that the capital spend is real. It's not something that is aspirational. It's projects that we know and understand and are going to execute over that time period. So we look at the forecast as very solid, very conservative, but that's what AEP does, we want to make sure that we deliver on the expectations and we will certainly do that as time goes on. So this is really the money slide, where we are moving from 4% to 6% growth rate to 5% to 7% growth rate and that\u2019s really says a lot about how we have repositioned the company. When you think about the rebates, everyone wouldn't know what the rebates was, and now you know this as 365 and that we have a growth trajectory on top of that, that goes to 5% to 7%. In the third year, that cone overlaps the 4% to 6% cone. But here's the real story is, the 5% to 7% CAGR continues to grow. So for long-term investors in our shares of stock, it's important to understand that this is a repositioning of the company that if you are long-term investor, you're in great shape going forward. And then secondly, for investors today, it's an opportunity to buy into that 5% to 7% CAGR. So I think it's just an amazing component of AEP going forward because when you think of AEP, you have the 5% to 7% growth rate, you have the investment in, in particular, wires and regulated parts of the business, and you have the ability to adjust as we go along, which we normally do with our capital forecasting and all the changes that we make along the way. So I would say that this repositioning, you can see down below, the operating earnings guidance range, we took the midpoint of the cone for the operation -- for the guidance range, and I think it's a very certainly while conservative, it's still an area that we're very comfortable with. So a lot of progress has been made from that perspective. Now attached to that with the earnings growth associated with it, our board has been consistent with focusing on that dividend range of 60% to 70% and we're well within that range. This shows the past in terms of the 4.9% dividend growth that's occurred. Our board recently approved additional increase in the dividend. We will continue to have the policy of having our dividend growth be commensurate with our earnings growth. So as we look at 5% to 7% CAGR on earnings, I think we can look forward to our dividends to be consistent with that approach as well. So it is a very positive story for our long-term investors as we look forward to the future, but even more so it\u2019s about what we\u2019re spending on and it\u2019s about the quality of the $17.3 billion of capital that we have focused on for the next three years. When you look at that, we\u2019re not spending on a large central station generation facility or anything like that, we\u2019re spending on projects, multiple projects, that we can manage from here on out, so in a very, very good position. So as I lead up to Brian coming up, this is a story of AEP, the new story of AEP, the premier regulated energy company, it\u2019s around higher growth, higher dividends, more regulated and more certainty. So from a shareholder perspective, it should be just an excellent story for investment going forward. So now, I\u2019m going to turn it over to Brian to give some more detail of not only the third quarter results, but also in terms of the other issues we\u2019ve talked about. So, Brian, you\u2019re up? Brian Tierney : Thank you, Nick and good morning, everyone. I\u2019m going to focus a little bit on the past and then I\u2019m going to try and catch up with my CEO and talk about the future a little bit as well, but I need to clear some things out of the way before we can get there. Let\u2019s start with the asset impairment that we announced today. This morning AEP announced a third quarter pretax impairment of $2.3 billion. This is $1.5 billion after-tax, and on a per share basis, it\u2019s $2.98. Fortunately, AEPs strong balance sheet can withstand this type of impairment. This moves our debt to total cap to 55% and doesn\u2019t come close to bringing in the question any covenants or credit events. The vast majority of this impairment is associated with generating units, some of which serve regulated customers in Ohio for more than 4 decades. We were required to conduct the asset impairment test due to the reduced likelihood of cost recovery in Ohio that Nick mentioned earlier, declining prices for capacity and energy and the market intelligence that we have gained in the recent sale process of other generating assets. There will be no cash tax savings from this impairment until the units are either sold or retired. However, coincident with the impairment, we \u2013 the capital budget for these plants was reduced by approximately $400 million over the remaining life of the plants. These are dollars that will be reinvested in our regulated or contracted businesses. This asset impairment, combined with previously announced sale of our other Ohio generating assets, puts the financial impact of the costly Ohio deregulation debacle squarely behind us. To be clear, we now have a significantly smaller financial footprint in Ohio, but we also have wires companies that in the state are in very attractive returns. This morning, we did release our traditional earnings presentation and press release on our website. But let me briefly take you through the highlights of the third quarter and year-to-date results. Most of the difference between GAAP and operating earnings for both periods is driven by the impairment that we just discussed. However, there are other items for you to be aware of, and they are found in the reconciling detail in the presentation and release. For 2016, third quarter operating earnings, AEP earned $640 million or $1.30 per share compared to $1.06 per share or $521 million in 2015. We experienced growth in each of our regulated segments with the major drivers for the earnings being weather, which added $0.07 per share and rate changes in lower O&M expenses, each of which added $0.09 per share. Generation & Marketing was down $0.03 per share for the quarter and corporate and other was down $0.02, partially reflecting the sale of River Operations. Turning to year-to-date results. Again, most of the difference between GAAP and operating earnings is attributable to the asset impairment. 2016 year-to-date operating earnings were $1.61 billion or $3.27 per share compared to $3.21 per share or $1.58 billion earned in 2015. Similar to the quarterly comparison, all the related segments were up year-to-date, partially offset by declines in a our regulated businesses, in our competitive businesses, I'm sorry. On the regulated side, rate changes added $0.18 per share and reduced O&M expense added $0.09 per share, partially offset by unfavorable weather of $0.05. In addition, the Transmission Holdco segment, added $0.12 per share, reflecting increased investment and recovery in that business. On the competitive side, Generation & Marketing was down $0.33 per share, largely due to increased, decreased capacity revenues and lower energy margins, down $0.19 and $0.10, respectively. And corporate and other, the sale of River Ops was a negative $0.03 per share. Given the strength of our regulated businesses and some of the help we've seen from warmer weather in the third quarter, we are confident in raising and narrowing our operating earnings guidance range for 2016 to $3.75 to $3.85 per share. Let me now take you through asset sale details, where we get the money from and then on the next slide, we'll talk about where we reinvest those proceeds to. In September of this year, we announced the sale of 5,200 megawatts of competitive generation. This transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2017. And we, at that time, we expect to record a gain of approximately 151, $150 million. The sales price was $2.2 billion. And after you account for debt retirement and taxes, we'll have net proceeds of about $1.2 billion, which we can then lever up to about $2.2 billion to reinvest in our regulated businesses. When we lever this up, we're taking dollars that had been trapped in a competitive business and directly transferring it to our regulated businesses, which offer a steadier and more stable growth profile. Let's go through some of the specifics where the use of that proceeds will go. For the years 2017 through 2019, AEP had planned to spend about $15.1 billion in capital expenditures. Now for the same period, we have the additional capacity to put the 2.1, $2.2 billion of levered sales proceeds to work in our regulated and contracted businesses. Let's talk specifics. Due to the previously discussed sale and impairment of assets as well as the refinement of our regulated generating plants, we were able to reduce our base combined generation CapEx by about $800 million. In the next three years, we will be able to invest an incremental $1.6 billion in our regulated transmission business, further improving resiliency and reliability for our customers. Our business model, including regulated Transcos, JVs and our integrated utility companies, as well as our extensive transmission and network, allow us to deploy this amount of capital effectively and efficiently. Our customers benefit in the near-term and the capital is put to work with very little regulatory lag and attractive rates. Lisa Barton, who heads this business for AEP, will provide more detail on how we will do this later in the presentation. We also have plans to invest about $400 million in renewable wind at our vertically integrated utilities. The pending expiration of the production tax credit makes renewable wind investments very timely for companies that had planned to invest in this space between now and the early 2020s. Bob Powers, AEP's Chief Operating Officer, will show the incredible position of renewables in our regulated companies' integrated resource plants later in the presentation. Finally, we believe that contracted renewables offer a regulated like risk profile with attractive returns. When will look to the future, we believe that renewables will play an increasingly important part in the country's energy mix, regardless of what happens to the Clean Power Plan. We believe this is a channel for us to serve customers who want renewable resources and for us to earn a reasonable return doing so at relatively low risk. We plan to invest about $1 billion or about 6% of our capital budget in this space over the next 3 years. We will be using the deferral method for recognition of the investment tax credit so there will not be an earnings clip associated with this activity. Chuck Zebula and his team have formed AEP OnSite Partners and AEP Renewables to serve customers in this area, and you'll hear more from Chuck later in the presentation about our plans in this area. When you look at the reduction in CapEx in businesses that we've sold or impaired and where we're reinvesting the levered proceeds from those sales, a truly attractive picture of future capital allocation starts to appear. Bob and Nick will highlight for you later how dramatically and in such a short period of time, the composition of our net plant has shifted to more weighted and wires, and our earnings profile has shifted from hybrid to regulated. Those shifts are a result of asset divestitures and careful capital allocation overtime. This pinwheel highlights a few key points. Our forecasted capital for the next 3 years, 94% of this is in regulated businesses, represented by the blue and green bars on the pinwheel. 74% of the forecast is allocated to the regulated wires business, and investors know why this is so important. If you consider contracted renewables as being regulated like, and I think you probably should, then fully 100% of our CapEx over the next 3 years is in regulated and regulated like businesses while we maintain the 74% allocation to the wires business. The careful capital allocation demonstrated by this slide is what drives the dramatic changes in business composition that Bob and Nick will highlight later in the presentation. Given the very robust capital investment forecast, the next obvious question is, can AEP afford it? And the answer is yes. Our capital forecast is not predicated on equity issuances and none are planned at this time. We believe that our cash flows from operations support credit metrics in the BBB+ and BAA1 range. We will have significant debt capital markets needs, but we've seen strong appetite from investors in our regulated and wires oriented paper. Finally, we've been asked about share buybacks. Our ability to quickly reinvest proceeds from asset sales into our regulated businesses, offer a superior total return proposition. As such, no share buybacks are planned at this time. We've explained the use of proceeds in our capital forecast and discussed that AEP can afford it, let's talk now about what this means to our rate base. The 5% to 7% earnings growth rate that Nick described is predicated on investing in our regulated properties for the benefit of our customers and then getting that investment reflected in rates. This slide shows it for our forecasted plan, our compound annual growth rate for rate base will be 7.7% from 2015 through 2019. That is, we will grow rate base from $32.8 billion to $44.2 billion. The top 2 bars, T&D Utilities and Transcos source, which account for about 72% of the rate base of growth, had very efficient mechanisms for putting investment into rates and allowing recovery. Vertically Integrated Utilities, the remaining 28% of investment, offer the same opportunity for recovery and to earn on the investment, just generally, with more lag. This lag contributes to the difference between the 5% to 7% earnings growth and the 7.7% growth in rate base. Let's take a look now at the waterfall, the current 2016 operating earnings guidance, to 2017. Looking at 2017, the midpoint of our operating earnings guidance is $3.65 per share compared to $3.80 in 2016. Generally, the decrease in earnings is driven by the expected decline in the Generation & Marketing segments due to the sale of the assets and the assumed return to normal weather in 2017. These unfavorable drivers were partially offset by rate changes and increased earnings from AEP's Transmission Holdco segment. Earnings for the Vertically Integrated Utilities segments are expected to be $1.85 per share, down $0.09 for 2017. The segments' major variances include increased interest expense and lower AFUDC, a return to normal weather, an increased depreciation expense not yet reflected in rates. Each of which will cost with the comparison $0.06 per share. These negatives were partially offset by a recovery of incremental investment to serve our customers and increase in normal load, which together add $0.09 per share to the comparison. The Transmission & Distribution Utilities segment are expected to earn $1.08 per share, up $0.16 over 2016's $0.92 per share. This segment's major variance is due to rate changes and regulatory provisions, which are projected to be higher by $0.14. Our AEP Transmission Holdco segment continues to grow and expects 2017 earnings to be $0.59 per share compared to 2016's earnings of $0.55. The growth in earnings reflects our return on incremental investment. Net plant, less deferred taxes is expected to grow by $1.3 billion between 2016 and 2017, an increase of 31%. The Generation & Marketing segment is expected to earn $0.19 per share compared to 2016 earnings of $0.50 per share. The 31% decline is due to the sale of the assets. Corporate and others is expected to be higher by $0.05 per share and should be driven by lower O&M. Now let's take a look at the normalized load trends that are supporting the forecast. We expect to end this year with a modest 0.2% growth, followed by a slight recovery of 0.6% in 2017. This is consistent with a modest economic recovery expected for AEP service territory as energy prices recover. The strongest growth in 2017 is expected to come from our Transmission & Distribution Utilities in Ohio and Texas. For the period 2017 through 2019, we are only anticipating growth in the range of 0.1% to 0.5%. Let's take a look at normalized load growth by class. Starting in the upper left quadrant, our residential sales are expected to fall by 0.3% in 2017, after growing by 0.4% in 2016. Residential customer class counts are expected to grow only 0.2% in 2017. If you exclude AEP Texas, residential customer accounts are expected to be essentially flat. Normalized residential usage is projected to decline by 0.005% due to the impact of energy efficiency and price elasticity. In the upper right, commercial sales are expected to increase by 1% in 2016 and remain relatively flat in 2017. Finally, in the lower left quadrant, you see a significant recovery in the industrial class, up 2% in 2017. Industrial sales have been held back in 2016 by low energy prices, strong dollar and weak global demand. We expect the number of industrial expansions to come online next year. Most of these are in the oil and gas sectors, but also include metals, transportation and plastics. In addition to capital allocation, we\u2019ve also been very disciplined about operations and maintenance expense. Since 2011, we have kept O&M, excluding trackers and riders between $2.8 billion and $3.1 billion, by implementing continuous improvement and procurement initiatives. This has enabled us to absorb network, IT security issues and other emergent work increases. We will continue to proactively manage our costs so as to keep O&M flat at approximately $3 billion over the forecast period. Let me briefly summarize before I turn the presentation over to Lisa Barton. In a very short period of time, we have changed this company\u2019s risk and earnings profile from a hybrid model to a very regulated model. And we\u2019ve done it primarily through two methods : The first is through asset divestitures and the second is through careful allocation of capital. Our strong balance sheet and credit metrics will allow us to continue to do this into the foreseeable future. When you take AEP\u2019s dividend yield of 3.5% to 4%, add it to AEP\u2019s earnings growth of 5% to 7%, AEP represents a total shareholder return proposition of between 9% and 11%. We believe that\u2019s significant for a business of this regulated risk profile. Transmission is a large part of that growth story, and I\u2019ll now turn it over to Lisa Barton to provide you details on that. Thank you. Lisa Barton : Well, good morning. It\u2019s a pleasure to be here with you today and talk about our Transmission business. As Nick mentioned, AEP owns, operates and maintains the largest transmission network in North America. From a transmission business unit standpoint, we have 2,600 employees located in over 90 offices across the system for 11 states. From these offices, we basically maintain the assets of our seven operating companies, our six Transcos and our five joint ventures. This is a portfolio that provides tremendous geographic as well as project diversity. And that has been and will continue to be key to our execution in the future. I want to talk a little bit about Transmission Holding Company and to point you to our net plant figures that you see on the screen here. Our Transmission Holding Company assets are fairly new. Underneath these companies, we have our joint ventures as well as we have our AEP Transmission Company and AEP Transmission recently secured Moody's rating of A2, with a stable outlook and S&P family rating of BBB+. In that issuance, they also mentioned the fact that if it was a stand-alone company, that AEP Transmission Company would get an A+ rating. These strong ratings reflect the strength of transmission-only businesses in our portfolio. By contrast, assets held in our operating companies are older. You can see that we have about $10 billion of net plants and used assets. And that reflects about 37,000 miles of line and 3,000 substations. AEP Transmission Holdco is created in 2011 with 2 FERC formula rates. Since that time, we've been putting dollars to work in support of good reliability and furtherance of that effort. Diversity has been our key in terms of our execution from a project portfolio standpoint and a geographic standpoint. It has enabled us year-over-year to reach not only our base case CapEx plans, but again, year-over-year, our high-case targets. The forecast that you see in front of you continues to focus on known projects, as Nick mentioned. It excludes large RTO projects that we think may be approved over the next coming years. Our current plan is to invest $3 billion a year, with respect to our Transmission business. We continue to anticipate the $3 billion will be evenly split between our operating companies and our Transcos on a going-forward basis. As you've known from me speaking in the past as well as Nick and Brian, we've talked about the fact that we have needed to invest a tremendous amount in terms of regional reliability upgrades. These are projects that are needed to support the regional infrastructure. We've needed these to interconnect wind projects in the West and to accommodate the retirement of our generation assets in the East, not only our assets but the assets of many other utilities in our Eastern footprint. Our next wave is going to focus more on local reliability projects and on replacing our assets that are aging. This is actually one of my favorite slides. We operate a system of transmission assets from 23 kV to 765 kV, and I will spend a little time on this slide here. We've got about 40,000 miles across our footprint and thousands of substations. The number one question that I get asked is how long is this runway. And this is one of two slides that attempts to give a little bit more perspective around that answer. Generally speaking, there are three significant asset types in the transmission space : lines, transformers and breakers. What you see here is the asset age profile of both our transmission lines as well as our transformers. Suffice it to say, the more you have, the older it is, the more you need to invest. If you take a look at those gray bands that you see here in the center, this reflects the life expectancy of our transmission lines and our transformers, respectively. Like any long-lived asset, there is not one date that these assets sale on, it is more or less a range and that gray band is reflecting of that range. If you look at the red bands, the red bands, left of the gray, shows the assets that are beyond their life expectancy. These are assets that are typically fully depreciated and require significant O&M. These are the assets that we need to focus on going forward. The other thing that I'd like to point out to you is as you look at, and I know it's difficult to see here on the screen, but if you look at the years as to when these assets were placed and serviced. The assets on the far left, the assets that are basically in red and quite frankly, a number of the ones in the gray are assets that are 138 kV and below. Our 345 kV build out took place between the '40s to '60s, and our 765 kV builds out took place in the '60s and '70s. When you think about the cost of replacing these assets, it starts to go up overtime. 345 is usually about twice the investment that you would have in a 130 kV investment and 765 is about 3 times the investment that you would have in a 138 kV investment. So as you can see, we have a long runway in front of us. Putting these numbers together in a different way, if you take a look at our system 10 years out, you will see that over 12,000 miles of line will be beyond their useful life, over 2,000 transformers and over 4,000 breakers. These are the types of investments that improve the reliability, resiliency and efficiency of the grid. So now on to my second most asked question, and that is, what is the average size of our projects? And as you've known in the past, it's been a difficult question to answer. With a system as large as ours, there really is no one average size project. We have thousands of projects going on at any given point in time and we're going to continue to in support of the $3 billion CapEx that we have per year in front of us for the next 3 years. But I wanted to show you a couple of examples. This is one of my favorite ones, and I like talking about this, this time of year because as there are leaves falling on the ground, there are transmission projects going into service. This is the time of year that we commission transmission projects. And so every day, basically, I'm getting an email talking about another line or another transformer being, going into service. So it's an exciting time of the year for the transmission shop at AEP. So this project is in McDowell County. Welcome to McDowell County, West Virginia. This project represents $143 million investment, where we're basically retiring our 88 kV system. In the past, you've heard me talk about the 88 kV system. It is an obsolete voltage class and one that we're seeking to basically eliminate across the system. It's very inefficient and it has several reliability problems. So this project is really designed to improve the local reliability in the West Virginia and Western Virginia footprint. In essence, it will bring a 138 kV source to the area, looping it and replacing these 2 stations. And I wanted to talk a little bit about these 2 stations. If you were to go there today, and I actually went there about a month or so ago, and the station manager who is in charge of the reconstruction here in this area gave me these two photos, which I thought were particularly pertinent to show. So I don't know if you can see the car on the far left. I do not know the age of the car, but I do know that, that is one old substation. And you can see the building that's there as well. That is back in the day when we man substations, where people actually were they were paid to be there 24 hours a day in order to open the breakers and so forth on the system. And if you also see the I want to go back a little bit here. If you look at the landscape, you'll see that it's been completely defoliated. This is a vibrant forest now today. And so these are the kinds of investments that are really helping to improve reliability in the future. Both of these substations, basically, will be leveled and it will be replaced by one substation, thereby dramatically increasing efficiency in the area. Okay, Cloverdale Station, Virginia. This is another one of my favorite projects. And this is one actually that went into service the 530 to 345 kV bank went into service last week. This is a project that was directed by PJM, and this was needed to support regional reliability. This reflects about $189 million investment and this picture really does not do this project justice. I was out there at the Cloverdale site, and this is probably about six months or so ago. And I stood on a hill that overlooked the station. And if you go from your far left, all the way and pan to the right, probably looking at about 120 degrees, you will see nothing but substation. This one station basically has resulted in us needing to put 25,000 truckloads to fill, 1,000 truckloads of concrete, 32 miles of ground grid, and it's taking over 600,000 man-hours to complete this project. In essence, it is a new 500 kV source feeding into the 345 kV system and required us to relocate 10 different transmission lines into this area. And this is really one of three stations in the area, so it'll all be linked together. This station is unique in the sense that it is a major point of interconnection between our system and the Eastern 500 system. It is one that has every voltage class that AEP has on the system in this station. On to a smaller project, this is a $40 million project. And this is the Marcellus Area Improvement Project. It's a small project with a big local impact. This is basically bringing in a new 138 kV loop with two distribution stations, and it enables shale gas development. This is an area that was underserved by transmission in the sense that it had a very old 69 kV system. We had new shale gas customers who were coming online and they needed additional capacity in order to operate. So we have put in a skid station to provide them with temporary service. And now that this line is going into service, they will be able to have full output of their facility. Again, back to some of our larger projects and out to the West. This is the Lower Rio Grande Valley, 345 kV project. It reflects a 156-mile line that's coming from North Edinburgh to Laredo. It's an investment of about $330 million. This is a project that has enabled multiple wind farms to be able to interconnect in our system and has dramatically improved the reliability to one of the fastest growing areas in the U.S. It was commissioned and put into service in May of this past year. So recent FERC filing. I'm sure everybody would like to hear a little bit about this today. We hit a 206 filing that is a request to adjust our rates from 10.99 to 8.32. This was filed by AMP and a number of other companies. Suffice it to say, we significantly disagree, with the ask that is -- than put in place there. After short a comment period, they will recommend a settlement period then we will go into settlement. We will be filing our response within the next 20 days. Concurrently, with this filing, we will be submitting a 205 filing. And I want to talk a little bit about what that 205 formula rate adjustment filing is seeking to do. Today, we have a partial historic, partial forward-looking rate. And so what ends up happening is in the summer, that rate gets adjusted each year. We have historical O&M and historical property taxes. Basically, this 205 filing would allow us to earn our authorized return going forward and it would be using projected plant and service, projected O&M and projected property tax. This would very much be in line with the rates that are in place for our PJM peers. So we talked about the opportunities in this space but in the end, it\u2019s all about execution. The Transmission business is filled with a number of first, we were the first investor-owned utility to move forward and delve into the competitive transmission space because we felt that it was important to be relevant in that space. We have developed a number of joint ventures that has enabled us to expand our system to 15 states and increase our investment opportunities beyond our traditional borders. We\u2019ve created Grid Assurance to adjust the need for large power equipment spares and we have our asset health center, which helps us manage and prioritize the equipment replaces -- replacements that are going to be needed in order for us to make this $3 billion CapEx investment. As the largest developer of transmission projects in the country, we\u2019re experienced and we\u2019re well positioned to execute the $3 billion entrusted to us to improve the reliability, resiliency and the efficiency of the grid. Thank you for your time. Robert Powers : Well, good morning, and thanks, Lisa. What a great investment story. And I\u2019m pleased to be able to have some time this morning to share with you the regulated properties are well positioned to put that capital investment and other capital investment to work for our shareholders. And I\u2019d also like to share with you how the capital allocation and a resource mix in AEP is changing based on crisp capital allocation, plant sales and unit retirements that\u2019s all leading to a lower environmental and lower overall business risk. So let\u2019s take a look. So Nick graciously allowed me to take his favorite slide, the equalizer slide, it\u2019s something you've all seen every quarter, and talk about how the regulated operations are doing. You\u2019ve seen it before, we have a variation in performance across the 11 states. But overall, I\u2019m pleased to report at the end of the third quarter, the regulated ROEs for these companies were 10.5%. We had some nice uplift from weather. But overall, the properties are performing at a rate of about 10%, like we performed over the last three to four years. Quickly going from left to right, to give you a perspective of what\u2019s going on. Obviously, Ohio is leading the ROE race here. It\u2019s now a wires company, smaller, and Nick had talked a little bit initially and will talk some more about some opportunities for investment in Ohio. But \u2013 and of the ROE at 13.2% is actually on a book basis, about 140 basis points higher. We\u2019ve discounted this number for some of the regulatory proceedings that gave us WAC, improved WAC recovery on fuel and the seed cap. So we\u2019ve removed that and this reflects more the ongoing earning power of AEP Ohio. APCo is now our largest operating company based on invested capital. It's navigating the Virginia base rate case freeze very well. We've obviously had improved performance on the West Virginia side of that business, and it's operating at a nice 10.1% ROE. Kentucky Power. All I can tell you, it's vastly improved from a year ago. It's at 7.2% ROE, benefiting from a $45 million rate case that was concluded last year. That will improve over time, but that property is struggling with load growth. And so we'll make appropriate adjustments, both in terms of our plan for additional rate case filings and, as Brian and I go around and look at invested capital, likely make adjustments to O&M and capital on that property as well. I&M is a very constructive regulatory environment, operating at about 11.2%, had good load this year. It's got a good environment overall and a good load forecast going forward. PSO has a rate case pending. We've put rates, $75 million of rates in effect, pending that final determination by the commission. We do have a growing backlog of invested capital in PSO that are outside the test year that's represented in that rate case. So we'll be looking at an opportunity to invest in PSO going forward again. SWEPCO at 7.2%. You do recall that, that property is somewhat handicapped by the 88 megawatts of Turk that is still not in rate base. However, it has constructive regulatory circumstance in other regards. And going forward, we'll be looking at recovering environmental investment in the Texas part of SWEPCO. We have formula rate proceedings in Louisiana that are also pending. So we're looking for some improvement in the SWEPCO performance as well. AEP Texas is a great wireless investment opportunity. Mechanisms to keep regulatory lag at a minimum, operating at about 10.3% ROE. And again, that with TCOS and DCOS opportunities in Texas, that's just a great investment story there. And the AEP Transmission Holdco company coming in a little bit better than forecast based on some improved lag performance in that particular area. So overall, I can represent to you that the regulated operations are well-positioned to take the capital that Lisa's putting to work, the capital that's going in the distribution and the remaining capital in generation to work. We've achieved about a 9.8% ROE overall in this business from 2014 to 2016. We're forecasting 9.9% in 2017, and we absolutely expect it during the period of 2017 to 2019. These properties will operate at about a 10% ROE. So pretty good. And I should say that my team is very effective at knowing how to deal with these circumstances. We know how to file rate cases and be successful in them. Brian and I are pretty good at making sure that a level of capital beyond the fundamental obligation to serve is directed to those operating companies that are performing well and restricted in those that are struggling. And we also take a hard look at O&M in the process. So overall, I think a pretty good story. Let's take a look at where some of the investment in these properties is going. And this next slide is an integrated view of the IRPs for the operating companies. And it's a summary. It's a snapshot as well. This will change based on fuel prices, or change based on technology cost, or change based on load. But at the end of the day, I think this story is much about what you don't see is what you see on this chart. You see over the forecast period, no new coal. You see no large nuclear generation projects. You see a limited amount of gas projects, and you see a lot of solar and wind. Now this is a much greener portfolio, obviously, than the traditional AEP coal by wire that you've known over the past years. These projects have been picked by the IRP process on the cost of the projects. But I also want to tell you that there's a lot of discipline that's been engrained in the analyzing team, discipline regarding future change in law, discipline regarding sober and realistic depreciation periods for competing assets as the planning process goes on. So all in all, this is a process that, at the moment, is delivering a much, much greener portfolio going forward. I think this is part of the story of AEP's change over the rapid change that Brian pointed out, and the change that will continue going forward. So what are the good consequences, the appropriate consequences of that change in resource portfolio? Well, taking a look at where our nameplate capacity exists, past and present and future, you can see that there's been a dramatic change in the generation portfolio for AEP. Back in '99, 68% coal on a 37,000 plus megawatt base. Flashing forward to 2017, 47% coal on a 30,000 megawatt base. Increases in the contribution in natural gas. Nuclear remains about the same. Increases in hydro, pump storage, wind, solar and the like and, obviously, increases also in energy efficiency and demand response. This is a changing portfolio. Unit retirements, sales, capital allocation are all driving a change to AEP. And let me share with you some of the environmental results that occur because of this. This gives you some idea of the dramatic, the very dramatic decreases in environmental emissions profile for the AEP fleet. From 1990 to 2015, 88% reduction in SO2, 87% reduction in NOx, 73% reduction in mercury. And as we look forward to the completion of the asset sales, Gavin plant will be removed. We see that goes up to over 94%, 93% for NOx, 89% for mercury. Just a great, great, great reduction in the environmental risk profile for AEP. And if you're wondering about CO2, well, that pesky little critter, you go back to year 2000, 167 million tons of CO2. You can see that by the end of 2017 will be about half of that, it's at 89 million tons. 46% reduction in CO2 at the time by the time we look at ultimate retirement or disposal of our Conesville and Zimmer and Stewart units. You're talking about over a 50% reduction in CO2 emissions from the AEP fleet, a dramatically changed risk profile from an environmental prospective. So let's take a look at a tale of 2 decades, as described here. Nick and I sort of changed jobs in 2006. I was the EVP of Generation. He came in as the EVP of Generation. Mike sent me off to get some experience in the utility business. So this is what I handed to Nick in 2006. 64% of the capital is being directed towards generation. A small Lisa, your business was just, I guess, a gleam in somebody's eye, right? And distribution, about 23%. Flash forward to 2016, okay, 58% of the capital budget is heading towards -- this is actually for the period of 2017 to 2019, but 58% in transmission, only 18% in generation and 24% in distribution. We have changed where capital goes in this business dramatically. In 2006, I sat down with Nick and said, \"It's all about environmental retrofits, scrubbers and SCRs and the like.\" And transmission was just starting. Now the focus is on wires. Lisa, you're putting more than $9 billion to work over the period of time in transmission. So just a dramatic change. Also look at the net plant profile, differences between 2006 and 2016. We are a different company. In 2006, 45% of the rate base was in generation, 20% in transmission and 35% in distribution. Look at the more distributed, reduced risk in generation on the 2016 chart, down to 32% in generation, 34% in transmission and 34% in distribution. And as we put 74% of our capital on an annual basis to work in distribution and transmission, okay, that pie chart on the right-hand side is going to continue to improve going forward. We also have an opportunity, going forward, to take a look at where new technology applies in this space. Columbus, Ohio was just recently picked as a smart city, big focus on electric transportation. But believe it or not, AEP was one of the biggest reasons that Columbus achieved that smart city grant from the Department of Transportation and Department of Energy. And what they liked was the vision that AEP could bring to the table regarding renewables, regarding smart distribution equipment, regarding micro grids, regarding technological use of batteries. And those are all opportunities that AEP is well-positioned to adopt strategically and in a focused manner going forward as that world continues to evolve. So let me now turn the presentation over to a guy that we all know as the coal guy, Mr. Coal, Chuck Zebula. And this is just going to really highlight to you the fact that AEP will be a greener company going forward. Charles Zebula : Thanks Bob, and good morning everyone. My good friend, Brian Tierney, often reminds me of an award I achieved in 2006, which was the Ohio Coal Man of The Year, and often take a ribbing for that. It's interesting to me that 10 years later, here speaking about our entr\u00e9e into the renewable energy space from a contracted basis. And so time does change a lot of things in our industry. And no question, 10 years from now, I'm sure there'll be someone up here, someone else up here talking about some other transformational opportunity in our industry. So we've had a very busy year in the competitive space. On November 12 of last year, 2015, we sold AEP River Operations to ACBL. That was a very successful transaction. And immediately, after that, we began working diligently on the divestiture of the 4 power plants that we sold in September, the Gavin plant, Lawrenceburg plant, Waterford and Darby. We announced that transaction in mid-September. As Brian and Nick had addressed earlier, all the regulatory filings are in for that transaction. We expect first quarter close for that, the teams at AEP are very busy, as well as the buyer of the assets transitioning, working on a number of work streams to enable a smooth transition. And all that work is on path, and it looks like we\u2019re on schedule for a first quarter close. A lot of people wonder, what takes so long for something like that occur? The due diligence process for gas plants is much different than it is for a coal plant. As you know, a coal plant was a big part of that sale, 2,600 megawatts at the Gavin plant. Throughout the process, we\u2019ve logged all the questions that we had to answer in the due diligence process. The due diligence teams, either finance, operational, environmental, legal answered over 6,000 submitted questions from the bidders on who were buying those assets. Very extensive due diligence, very good work, it actually makes the transitional efforts very easy as we go forward. So besides being very busy with those two processes, there has been time and effort spent on looking at the renewable space and what is changing out there in the industry. Early in 2016, we decided to enter that space because it gave us the ability to invest, gave us the ability to grow our company, provide solutions to customers, which are largely technology-based, and ultimately to provide a cleaner emission profile for them as well. So a very positive sign for us with being in the business for less than a year, become very active and very welcome. And since we are very purposeful in our commitment in how we spend capital, we can actually choose the projects that we want to participate in, those that balance the risk and reward profiles that we\u2019re looking for as a company. And as Brian mentioned earlier, over the next three years, we plan to commit about $1 billion in this area, and I\u2019ll describe to you how we plan to achieve that goal. So we formed two subsidiaries earlier this year, one called AEP OnSite Partners, the other AEP Renewables. Let\u2019s first talk about AEP OnSite Partners. This primary purpose of this company is to work with large end-use customers on solutions and projects, helping them to achieve their specific goals, whether that would be applying a technology, reducing emissions or lowering their cost and energy profile. In this company, AEP is providing an asset to the customer, which is ultimately backed by a 20 to 25 year power purchase agreement. So far, the projects we\u2019ve invested in have been solar mostly. There have been some other technologies that are part of the portfolio, size of the solar projects between one and five 5 megawatts and costs generally between $2 million and $15 million. Again, we\u2019ve been very successful in a very short period of time, committing to about 21 projects this year in eight different states, with capital investment close to $75 million. These opportunities are created through our ability to cross-sell from our subsidiaries, AEP Energy and AEP Energy Partners, our wholesale and retail affiliates as well as our relationships with developers, customers and technology providers in the industry. Without a doubt, distributed renewable resources are a growing trend, and our participation has been successful and welcome. On the AEP Renewables side, the scope of this company is to participate in the long-term power purchase arrangements that are backed by wind and solar assets to serve utilities, municipalities and corporations. These projects are, of course, larger scale, require more capital, require a bigger tax appetite, but they also provide compelling cash return economics. In this space, we are largely purchasing projects from developers, which of course are backed by 20 to 25-year power purchase arrangements with creditworthy entities. So let's take a look at the next slide and look at a couple of the sample projects that we're doing in this area. On the left side of this slide is a example project for AEP OnSite Partners. In June of this year, we put this 3.6-megawatt solar project in operation for the city of Clyde, which is located in Northwestern Ohio. It's backed by a 25-year PPA. This project came about because the city wanted to do a solar project. AEP had an existing wholesale relationship with the city of Clyde providing them power. And due to that relationship, we were able to explore the opportunity to build this solar plant for them. Project was built on time, on budget, operating within the expectations that we had set for ourselves. A win-win relationship for AEP, for the client, and it's our inaugural project in the OnSite Partners space. It's also representative of the kinds of projects AEP OnSite Partners will do, providing behind-the-meter distributed technologies to customers who desire these kinds of solutions. On the right side of the slide is an example project from AEP Renewables. It's called Pavant Solar III. It's located in Utah. It's a 20-megawatt AC solar plant, backed by a 20-year PPA with PacifiCorp. Now there are two other projects located adjacent to Pavant III, Pavant I and Pavant II, which are owned by Dominion and PSEG. Our project's currently under construction, being constructed by JSI Construction, which is a division of juwi. We expect this project to be operational before year's end, and are excited about this kind of opportunity. It demonstrates our commitment to this space. It demonstrates our willingness and delight in working with a reputable strong utility, such as PacifiCorp. And it demonstrates to developers that we are a real player in this market and are willing to take on projects as we look at the wind and solar opportunities here going forward. So when we look at the outlook, we do see a strong pipeline of opportunities. As you look and attend to other utility meetings here this week and at EEI, you might wonder, wow, lots of people are chasing all these opportunities. How does it all stack up? The reality is, some of this is stimulated by the desires of customers, right? Some of it's by regulatory policy, tax policy, declining technology cost. This stuff is real, and it's happening. Our investments in this area will be disciplined, focused on the long-term PPAs backed by the asset and will be supported by significant efforts from our development, marketing and due diligence teams, which were have built with internal hires, but also external hires here over the past 9 months. Ideally, we're looking for investments that balance the wind and solar profile. We're not webbed to either technology in a sense because they complement each other from an earnings and financial profile, and they provide both strong cash returns due to their tax benefits. Regarding the $1 billion that we plan to spend, we already have letters of intent in place for about 30% of that $1 billion that we plan to spend over the next 3 years. And we're in the due diligence phase for that 30%. So in summary, we're very pleased about our entr\u00e9e into this marketplace. It leverages our existing customer businesses to provide them asset backed opportunities. Again, we are a welcomed to partner due to our strong financial position, our relationships and our proven participation. I'm very confident that we can invest this $1 billion in a way that balances the risk and rewards that we are seeking in the renewables area. That's all I have for today. I'm going to turn it over to Nick, who will summarize this eventful day for AEP. Thank you. Nick Akins : As you can see, there's a great degree of enthusiasm about where this company is going in the future. I know some say that AEP really should be a boring regulated utility, but it's anything but that. It's actually, I think for me, personally, it's the most exciting time that I've ever experienced in my career working for a company that's really focused on the future. It doesn't have the baggage that we used to have, and is really clear to focus and make those decisions that are going to be important for our customers in the future. So as I, let me go one more slide here. We've gotten pretty good at doing these before and after slides to get our point across. But if you look at 2014, 79% of our earnings were from the regulated side. Afterwards, today, 97% of our earnings will be from the regulated operations. So clearly, clearly, a substantial change has occurred. And you heard Bob mention, this is really the exciting part. To me, I get carried away. I know Bette Jo doesn't want me to talk about technology a lot, but that will be for the next Investor Analyst Day. But clearly, we're in a position now where we have a firm foundation to be able to grow and make decisions about how we want to address the customer experience in the future. And that's done through infrastructure development, blocking and tackling associated with these projects. When you tell Lisa Barton, \"Hey, guess what? You have another $1.6 billion you need to spend over 3 years.\" And she said, \"Yes, we can do that.\" And that shows the incredible agility of what we have relative to our projects, the project flow, the project management, all those types of activities to support the investment that's being made. I'm very proud of our entire executive team and the team at AEP that really is focused on not only advancing the strategic aspects of what we're trying to achieve in the future, but also dealing with those areas of cost containment, optimization, continuous improvement mechanisms. All those types of things are occurring and that's what helps us reach the earnings targets when you see O&M expenses consistent for years. So it really is a tremendous time, where everyone's on deck to make sure that we are focused on the future. So when I look at again, I will resurrect the slide I used earlier. As we move closer to the presidential election time, I am going to make my pitch about AEP, and I will sort of be like a candidate with a parting message. But if you look at the premier regulated energy company, AEP, it's a vote for higher growth, a vote for higher dividends, a vote for more regulated, a vote for more certainty. And I can't imagine anything that's better for the shareholders of the future, and that's American Electric Power. So thank you very much, and we'll take questions now. Brian, do you want to come up to the other podium. Lisa Barton : For the purpose of the webcast, if you could state your name. Andrew Levi : Hi, it's Andrew Levi from Avon Capital. Just a couple of questions. 2018, 2019, what gets you to the high end of your guidance? Brian Tierney : Load recovery and rate improvements. It's really a recovering economy. Andrew Levi : On the plant impairments, on those 4 plants that you have out there, are they losing money in '17, 18 and '19 in your forecast? Or how does that work? Brian Tierney : They're going to be about cash flat. Andrew Levi : No, but earnings-wise? Brian Tierney : About flat. Andrew Levi : Flat? Okay. So if you were to sell or shut them, there wouldn't be any earnings incurred one way or the other? Brian Tierney : Correct. Nick Akins : Yes, just think about what we need to do relative to those assets. I mean, some of them are multiple owners. So we've got to resolve some of those issues. So there's really our own strategic review around those sets of assets to determine, can there be consolidation? Would you package them together? How do you deal with the variances associated with those particular plants as opposed to the non-PPA plants? Andrew Levi : Well, I guess, 1 or 2 of them, if they were, let's say, Dynegy's co-owner on them? I guess, they probably could run them cheaper than you guys? Do you feel that? Robert Powers : We're in talks with people who might be interested in buying those. And obviously, co-owners might be ways that we could settle that fairly easily. But there are others who are interested in those as well. Andrew Levi : Okay. And then my last question, and I'll let somebody else go, on the 205 filing that you made, is that in your guidance that you get that? Or is it your guidance basically incorporates how you have it today? Nick Akins : Lisa, do you have a microphone? Lisa Barton : Thanks. So the 205 filing, we have one, we have not filed it yet. We anticipate doing so in the next 30 days. The guidance that you see basically is reflective of the ROE before the 206 complaint, as well as not having the 205. The two in \u201817 will likely cancel out each other. When you look at \u2013 for example, we have O&M expenses, property taxes, and the impact of bifurcated plant in service, if you look at over the past three years that\u2019s been about 119 basis point delta. Brian Tierney : And Andy, the net \u2013 the net that keeps us in the range. Lisa Barton : The question is, would it be a one-year pop; and yes, it would be a one-year pop. And what we have seen in the past is on an average, has been about 119 basis points. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Back here. Julien Dumoulin-Smith, UBS. Just a couple of quick questions. Well done on the transition regulated. Let\u2019s turn it back to that 3% unregulated for a quick second. Can you talk about what the future is of that 3%? What is there? Is it sustainable? And then also, where are you reflecting the renewables pieces? In that 3%, I mean, obviously, there\u2019s probably not a ton in there. How does that grow over time? And then perhaps a second one, if I can throw it out there. What is a good rule of thumb in terms of levered IRR, earned ROE or just in general, 100 megawatts of x contributes x cents? Nick Akins : Yes. So we\u2019ll make sure Chuck gets a microphone here as well, if there\u2019s a microphone. We\u2019ll get back to all the questions. Don\u2019t worry about it. But part of that is the energy supply business, the retail business, and I have been a proponent of maintaining that retail business because, and Chuck talked about this a little bit, it\u2019s a relationship, it\u2019s a channel growth opportunity. As you long as you stay disciplined around the execution and can find the risk of that business, it can be a very good business. Now we\u2019re not a huge retail energy provider in this country. I mean, obviously, we don\u2019t intend to be that. We are \u2013 we have about 500,000 customers in that part of the business spread out in various states. And it gives us eyes and ears in terms of what customers truly want in those various areas, and it gives us an opportunity to expand in other areas as well. So Brian, I don\u2019t know if you have additional comments? We\u2019ll get to Chuck as well. Brian Tierney : Yes. So just to add to that right, the contribution or lack of contribution, if you will from the PPA plants right would be also represented in that 3% area. So again, it\u2019s the retail business, the wholesale business, and the contracted renewables. All of those businesses are fully hedged, either backline asset or some other hedging mechanism right through our risk management procedures. And in terms of \u2013 as we look at investing in contracted renewables, if you kind of stack up the IRR kind of possibilities in orders of preference financially, we\u2019d prefer a win, it also comes with more risk, right? Secondly, we prefer the OnSite Partner opportunities because those smaller projects often have an ability to get a higher IRR. And then lastly, the universal solar is providing kind of the least opportunity in terms of IRR and equity as we stack up what we want to do in pursuing that business. Charles Zebula : I also see the retail business as a hedge from a structural part of the industry going forward because you know, I mean you\u2019re seeing in Nevada and other states the potential for some form of restructuring. If that were to occur, we want to make absolutely sure we have the foundation ready to advance from that perspective. And we've done a nice job of it so far. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: But just to clarify, call it, diamond of earnings from the retail business, that should be ongoing? And renewables should be incremental to that number? Nick Akins : Exactly. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. Okay. Excellent. And then just if I can follow up real quickly, separate related subject. Why not do renewables via kind of a more traditional rate-based approach? Why bother with the contracted PPA approach at all? Charles Zebula : We're going to do that as well. And that was the $400 million that we talked about for the use of proceeds. That was in vertically integrated utilities. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. Nick Akins : And keep in mind, too, a lot of things that Chuck is doing in his part of the business around the relationships with customers, whether it's micro grids, whether it's solar, wind, battery technologies. We're also working to advance the regulatory structural mechanisms in place to support or regulate utilities to make those same type of investments, because that's important to provide universal access to everyone as opposed to individual customers with those tailored needs. Michael Weinstein : Hi. Mike Weinstein from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Just to follow up on Julien's question. Can you quantify the IRR, ROEs that you expect to get from the renewables business? Robert Powers : That's competitive information, I'd hate to be able to throw that out there in the space and offer my competitors the ability to know where AEP's doing business. There's very active projects we're participating in right now. Would not be a wise thing to do to. Michael Weinstein : And one, just one follow-up on... Nick Akins : Let me just to add that, though. We talked a lot about the threshold level that's acceptable to us. And that when Chuck was talking about being selective in the process, we're managing the discipline around that from a financial perspective. Michael Weinstein : Just one follow-up on the transmission forecast. The EPS forecast looks a little bit lower than the EEI presentation from last year. I'm just wondering what drives that. Nick Akins : Brian? Chuck? Lisa Barton : It is, basically, it's bonus depreciation is the most significant contributor in 2015. We did not assume extension of bonus depreciation. Also, this past year, our network system peak will change from summer to winter peaking. And that results in a lag that would be remedied with the 205 filing. Michael Lapides : Michael Lapides of Goldman. Two questions, one, a little bit of housekeeping, and one more kind of strategic or longer term. On the housekeeping, Brian, one of the slides, Slide seven shows that you actually do have earnings contributions from the generating business in 2017. I think it's $0.09 from the remaining assets and $0.09 from the soon-to-be divested ones? Brian Tierney : It's until the sale, Michael. Michael Lapides : For both? Brian Tierney : Yes. So $0.09 from the generating, and I apologize. That's until we sell it, then we don't have that. And then it's about $0.09, $0.10 for what's left. Michael Lapides : Got it. So like if I were to rebase '17, it's really that $3.47 you're talking about? Brian Tierney : Yes. Michael Lapides : Okay. My second question is more thinking about the generation portfolio at the regulated subsidiaries. And you've done a great job as a company overall of reducing emissions, putting controls on existing coal plants. We've seen some of your peers among the larger utilities be more proactive in terms of fleet transformation at the regulated subs, meaning whether building and owning gas-fired generation within the regulated business. And I know you can't really do that right now in Ohio. You've got a lot of other regulated subs that own generation. But you've not build a lot of gas fired generation in rate base. We've seen other companies, including ones that are in states that don't have renewables standards. So states in the Southeast neighboring some of yours that built renewables in rate base. And I know, Brian, you touched on you're going to spend $400 million or so. Back of the envelope map, that's not even 300 megawatts. For a company your size, it's kind of a rounding error. So just curious how you're thinking about fleet transformation at the regulated subsidiaries within the AEP asset ownership profile versus other owners? Or is this a conscious move where AEP becomes less of an owner of the generation that serves its customers? Nick Akins : Yes. So as far as regulated generation is concerned, we'll still be an owner of that generation. I think when you going back to Bob's slide of the future and what we're showing, it's all renewables and natural gas. Now keep in mind, our Western territories already have a lot of natural gas. And but we made decisions, and you can expect decisions to be made very differently about the investments that were made, particularly as it relates to coal fired generation, and whether the mechanisms we can work through to ensure that we reinforce the transition occurring. We just retired a wells unit, one of the wells units, and that was in the context of adding renewables as well. You're going to see more of the trade off being made of natural gas and renewables against coal fired generation to really focus on balancing out that fleet perspective. So the units we have left are fully controlled, but the issue still remains. When you look at huge, new investments being made and what you have to invest in those plans in the future versus making a change here during a transformation cycle, that's an opportunity that we have with all of our regulated jurisdictions to go through, through the integrated resource planning process. And we intend on doing that. I think you're seeing, like I said, very, very different decisions being made about not only depreciation, but also in terms of investment and where you focus on the plant actually being retired. In the past, it was run these plants as long as you can. Today, it's really bound to financial decisions around what the options are, which are very different today, versus trying to achieve that transformation as quickly as possible. So Brian? Brian Tierney : Yes, Michael, the only thing I'd add to that is we're not in a position of having to add large central station generation right now. Remember, given what happened with Ohio deregulation, there were states that wanted access to Amos and Mitchell that they've had for many years. And we were able to transfer those assets at book value and cover up a lot of those company central station needs for a long period of time. In addition, in the West, we also have Turk that was recently added to the portfolio there. And so there hasn't been large central station needs in the Western part of our system as well. Nick Akins : And keep in mind, too, just the overall investment thesis is, all of our investments are smaller, whether generation smaller capacity segments or smaller in terms of transmission investments, things that we can turn on and off in a very fluid fashion as opposed to being half built on a $1 billion scrubber or in the middle of a large central station facility. We're not doing that. We're going to be focused on investments that we can make to have the agility that's required to provide that consistent earnings profile. That's what we're doing across the board. Jonathan Arnold : Brian, first, on O&M, the slide shows $3 billion flat through 2017. I think you might have said something about beyond? But could you just clarify what we should be thinking about within the guidance for O&M out to '17. Nick Akins : Our goal is to keep it at that level for the foreseeable future. And there's been a transition on that as well, Jonathan. Some of that, as you know, as we've sold some of the generation or shut down some of the generation, the generation has gone down. And some of the things that we've been spending on emerging costs, like IT and security, have actually increased over time. But our goal is through continuous improvement initiatives and procurement initiatives to stay at that $3 billion level for the foreseeable future. Jonathan Arnold : Safe to say that's what's in the guidance? Brian Tierney : Yes. Jonathan Arnold : And then separately, you sounded like you might be at least somewhat optimistic you could still sell the PPA assets. I think, Nick, you described the restructuring as being thinking about the future. And I was just curious whether that precludes some sort of arrangement around those existing assets or just handicapping which way you that'll likely to go and how likely you are to be out of them. Nick Akins : Yes. We definitely want to be able to neutralize the financial impact of those units. In the restructuring discussion, I really believe that we have, hugely, a much better chance of going through restructuring with a forward view of what we can do for Ohio. When you look at those assets, and particularly when you're thinking about in the excess cost of market recovery that's being transferred back to the wires company, that really -- while it potentially could be done as a challenge, and it encumbers the ability to really get that forward view of the investment potential that's available in Ohio for us. So I tend to look at it more from a forward perspective than looking back. That may have impacts on others, obviously. But from an AEP perspective, after all, you get -- you can only beat your head against the wall so many times. And it really is a difficult message to say, we want excess cost over market. And that becomes the headline as opposed to a true forward-looking view of enhancing the earnings capability of the company going forward. If we're able to move forward and have Ohio in a position where the utilities can invest in new generation, then that's also an earnings positive for us that's not in the plan, and that's something that we're really focused on. Jonathan Arnold : And level of optimism on selling the assets? Brian Tierney : I mean, so we've had third parties who were interested in examining those assets, and we've had a team that's been focused on selling a different set of assets. And as that comes to a close, we're going to explore conversations with those folks. Praful Mehta : Hi guys, Praful Mehta from Citi. So a quick question, just to clarify again on the 2017 earnings. The $0.09 we get, that is the assets that are being sold. The other $0.09, is that the other assets, the PPA assets, effectively? And is that earnings neutral or is that $0.09 that other assets? Brian Tierney : The $0.09 is everything else that's in Chuck's business, but we don't anticipate much contribution from the -- what we used to call the PPA assets. Charles Zebula : That\u2019s right. Praful Mehta : Got you. And so if you look at the trajectory then going forward, the 5% to 7%, given if Chuck\u2019s business, effectively the other $0.09, what contribution, I guess, is the renewable component going forward? So if you look at, let\u2019s say, 2019, apart from the utility business, which we can see in the growth profile, what is the renewables business, I guess, add up to as a proportion of the total by 2019? Charles Zebula : So you should think of it \u2013 next year, in the $0.09, we have a favorable hedge position by which is contributing, right to the benefit of that $0.09, right? As that rolls off, if we sell the generation, that number is going to come down and it\u2019s going to be replaced, right, by the growing renewable business. So you should consider that $0.09 to be somewhat slow-growing through the period, not at the 5% to 7%. Praful Mehta : Fair enough. And then, finally, just to \u2013 Chuck you said a number of people are going after renewable businesses, and this seems to be the new kind of theme to kind of seek growth right now in the utility space. I guess, just to test that thesis, if you don\u2019t get the IRRs that you\u2019re looking for because it is becoming more competitive to buy contracted renewable assets, is there a backup plan B? As in, if you\u2019re not able to deploy the $1 billion of capital, do you have a Plan B? Or is that \u2013 what I guess is, is if you don\u2019t get the ability to invest, what do you do? Charles Zebula : Yes, I think I\u2019d be a lot more concerned if we just laid out a $3 billion or $4 billion plan over the next 3 years. Because in reality, I think with the $1 billion plan, we can high grade that opportunity and choose the projects that we want to participate in. If I was to win everything that I\u2019ve have got a bid out on, I\u2019d be well over $1 billion right now. And I already 25% of it in letter of intent phase that I \u2013 that basically we\u2019re going through the due diligence to make sure everything is set on that. So the reality is I\u2019m very comfortable at $1 billion because it allows me to choose what I want to do. If things fall through the bottom, we\u2019ll return the capital to the company, right and the company will deploy that in a different fashion that provides the return right that you were seeking as a shareholder. Praful Mehta : Got you. But there's no plan ever to move into the development side. It\u2019s always buying developed assets is the goal? Charles Zebula : Yes. There could be a few exceptions AEP owns some property that has renewable development potential. So that would be the exception. But the rule is more stepping in, right, behind the developers, already incurred those expenses and purchasing the projects. You could strand up a lot of cost, right through developing projects. And so therefore, we\u2019re playing a much lesser role in the true development phase. We are more development in the OnSite partner part though, because you\u2019re specifically working with a customer. Nick Akins : Keep in mind, your premise was around plan B. Chuck gives the plan B. Plan A is to focus on our transmission and regulated investment. And when we look at what Chuck is doing, Chuck is some form of high grading, but certainly that is occurring because we have that optionality. But it\u2019s not \u2013 is not the way we\u2019re trying to grow his business at an inordinate standpoint when we have the forecast out there. We want to forecast that Chuck is completely comfortable with as opposed to something, again, that's aspirational that may or may not occur or could occur with low returns. So we have that ability and I think that's the huge part of the message here today. As Chuck said, if you can't do it at the threshold level that we set on the return expectations, we're also constantly looking at our own business, including transmission, including the regulated operations, to see what we can make those investments in. And with the growing areas of security, resiliency of the grid, technology deployment around the customer experience, those are also growth areas that will be occurring on that side. So this is not set in stone. This is what we know today. And as we look at the future, that process will continue and we'll continue to look for even further growth. We're not stopping there. Ali Agha : Ali Agha, SunTrust. First question, the $2.2 billion that you've invested or plan to invest over the next three years. Just to be clear, for planning purposes, in total, what kind of return have you assumed on that? Is that the 10% roughly that you've been looking at on the regulatory side? Brian Tierney : Yes. Nick Akins : Yes. Ali Agha : Okay. And then second question. In your chart, when you look at the 5% to 7% growth, you have a section beyond '19 kind of the future, if you will, what is your line of sight right now? How far is your visibility when you look at the transmission projects that Lisa has or other investments that gives you comfort that this continues how far beyond '19? Brian Tierney : I think that's what Lisa was trying to lay out and showing age of system, the type of projects that she's investing in. We see a run way going out 10 years in that business for ample opportunity to invest, whether it's aging infrastructure, local reliability, regional reliability. One of the things that we haven't seen yet and we should have opportunity to invest upwards of $1 billion associated with retirements that happened in 2015, there is likely another set of retirements that are coming about associated with the affluent standards of what we, in effect in the early 2020s. So that's not even in our numbers yet on top of what we have just on our own system. Ali Agha : And Brian, as you look at those investment opportunities even beyond '19, when at the earliest do you think equity issuance comes to the table for AEP? Brian Tierney : I just, I don't see it in our plan right now. That's not to say that we wouldn't do that for the right opportunity. But we haven't had to do that since 2009, and I don't see it in our plan currently. Nick Akins : We even cut off the DRIP. Brian Tierney : Yes. Ali Agha : Last question, Nick. There is ongoing consolidation going on in the space, electric as well as gas. Maybe not the next three years, but strategically, is there an interest for you now that you are 100% focused regulated company to seek out opportunities for growth? Nick Akins : Absolutely, we're always looking at opportunities. But, and you know the story, we have to be positioned to do that. I think we are positioned to do that. But there again, the things we talk about today, the indigenous growth potentials that we have within our service territory, the ability to invest, it's a higher threshold for us. So it's going to have to be something that's truly strategic, truly something that's additive to the issues that we've brought up today. And we'll continue to looking at that. But I think we are in a much better position to do that kind of thing strategically. But our focus is making sure that we are wise in the capital deployment that we have, that we're efficient for investors and as long as we will only be paying premiums, if it's of true strategic value going forward. Right now, we're making a lot of investments with no premiums. Ali Agha : But the organic opportunities keep you at that 5% to 7% threshold? Nick Akins : Absolutely. And actually, on that graph, we even talked about how it will end. I mean because, you show the cone going out and you cut it off for the year. The logical question is what happens after that? And we purposely said, no it continues on. We're in a great position in that. Steven Fleishman : Steve Fleishman. Couple of related questions. Just overall, in your plan, kind of what is the impact on customer rates? Are you kind of close to inflation on average crusher system? Also, are there any kind of key rate cases coming up that we should watch? And then, lastly, in the Ohio ESP outcome, there was the grid mod and renewables that you were allowed to do. Is that in the plan? Is that part of the mix here? Brian Tierney : So let me start with the rate changes. Over the forecast period, we're anticipating average rate increases in the 3% range. Robert Powers : In regarding Ohio, I'm reasonably optimistic that some of the issues, Steve, that you highlighted will get resolved in the near term, which would represent investment opportunity and enhanced DIR. Again, I think the smart city decision in Columbus has got the attention of the Public Utility Commission of Ohio from a positive standpoint. As far as rate cases you should watch, we're watching the pending decision by the Oklahoma Commission in PSO. Obviously, we put $75 million of rates at risk on that decision. If for whatever reason that doesn't mean our expectation, we'll be looking to refile in Oklahoma shortly after. Nick Akins : Yes. Certainly, Steve, I wouldn't want to undervalue the importance of issues like the smart city challenge, that was one. We already had proposals before the Ohio Commission focused on smart city type of applications. And it's important to not only the entire area of Central Ohio, but important to many leaders, including the commission, to focus on the ability for us to invest in those smart technologies of the future. And so we see that as an important framework for the expansion in other areas of our service territory. That's the, and with those particular riders that are applied for, we expect the commission to be very supportive of those applications because that is AEP's avenue for growth in Ohio, that along with the restructuring. And I think we've probably registered the importance of AEP's position in Ohio is driven by our ability to invest in new technologies, new generation, but also focus on the strategic aspects of smart cities and those types of applications, whether it's micro grid technologies, energy storage, those kinds of devices that can be deployed to support transportation or other types of activity. So that is a central part of the theme going forward for Ohio. Gregory Gordon : Greg Gordon. Just on Pages 19 and Page 37, you talk about the current earned ROEs, expected earned ROEs, and you talked about in your guidance that the difference between the 7.7% CAGR on rate base and the 5.7% earnings growth target is regulatory lag. So can you kind of walk through the algebra of that? Because I think that would presume that your ROEs are going down over time when, theoretically, you should be trying to make them go up. Brian Tierney : Very good. There's a couple of things going on there that add to that lag as well. One is the fact that we have $0.09 in for a business that we're going to sell in 2017, and that, of course, goes away. And so we need to make up that piece as well. And I think taking that out, you can do the algebra and you'll get very close to the 7.7%. You'll also see that the remaining piece, the $0.09 that we had talked about that Chuck described doesn't grow as fast as the 7.7% as well. So those 2 factors, combined with the lag, will get you to the reconciliation between the 5% to 7% growth rate and the CAGR of 7.7%. Gregory Gordon : Okay. So you do think that in the core business, when we do that, sort of the big -- the layer cake here, that the ROEs are stable. Robert Powers : You'll end up right on top of it. Paul Patterson : Paul Patterson, Glenrock Associates. Just -- I guess, for Lisa, FERC Order 1000, just sort of competitive issues they are developing also with smaller -- potential smaller projects and what have you, just sort of what your outlook is on that. And then also, just in terms of O&M and you're investing -- you're replacing 100-year-old stuff and what have you, it sounded to me that the 205 complaint sort of suggested that there was actually regulatory lag with respect to O&M. I was wondering, how is O&M trending, given that you're putting that much CapEx in the business? Just intuitively, I would think that would mean your O&M might go down. So I just was wondering if you could elaborate on those 2 things. Lisa Barton : Sure. Both great questions. With respect to Order 1000, we won two of the two competitive projects in PJM. I think that the RTOs are still struggling with the process. I don't think the RTOs like the process of moving forward with Order 1000. That being said, I think it's very difficult for folks to argue against there being some level of competition in that space and that is what FERC has continued to say. So we continue to be well positioned in that space. So we look within our borders as well as outside our borders. And we firmly believe that your best defense is a strong offense. And so by virtue of actually participating on these, we've actually identified a lot of projects that benefit our customers that we'd move forward on, whether it be investments of our operating companies or our Transcos. So even though it shows really a couple of smaller projects in that space, it's allowed us a strong defense as well. With respect to O&M, yes, we are reducing some of that O&M, but you have to kind of take a look at the overall system. We still have 37,000 miles of line and over 3,000 substations that are older. So it will take quite some time before you'll see significant savings on the O&M side of that piece. As you mentioned, with respect to the 205 filing, that 205 filing that we make is going to allow us to fix to -- fix our formula rates that is completely forward-looking. As you know, in the past, we've had one that's a bit of a hybrid. We have been reticent to move forward on that 205 because as soon as you move forward on the 205, you're triggering an ROE review. And so this actually provides us that opportunity to address that on a going-forward basis. And it will allow us to also remedy the network system, peak load adjustment that would have been a one year hit for us into '17 as well. The nice thing about the 205 is it positions us also in those outer years to actually achieve our authorized ROE, whatever that might be. What we have had in the past is you\u2019ve always seen on the slide that has the \u2013 what our ROE has been, like the 12.2%, that is always reflective of the true-up. And so that true-up would go away and it would also \u2013 it would be forecasted. Paul Patterson : And then just on the 3% rate increase, in fact, is that the entire bill? Or is that just the rate base? I mean, is that the entire bill that we\u2019re talking about that you\u2019re seeing in that \u2013 in annual numbers? Brian X. Tierney: Entire bill average across the system. Paul Patterson : Yes, okay. Anthony Crowdell : Anthony Crowdell, Jefferies. Two quick questions. I guess, one, to Chuck, when I look at that $0.09 we\u2019re all talking about, on Slide 20, you show renewables as $0.01. So then is the other $0.08 all generation on marketing? Is that a good way to look at that? Charles Zebula : Yes, yeah, for \u201817. Anthony Crowdell : Great. That was easy. Question for Bob, I guess, and a little to Jonathan\u2019s question earlier about Ohio restructuring. I mean, if we think of the potential outcomes that could come about, whether it\u2019s full regulation \u2013 or reregulation of the state or some stranded cost recovery, I mean, what are the kind of options you think are possible coming out of Ohio? Robert Powers : Well, as Nick handicap things and I would agree since our team is kind of reporting out to Nick, I don\u2019t think a total restructuring is, if you were to handicap that, you\u2019d have to get some pretty long odds to take that bet. As far as stranded cost recovery, maybe not as much of a galvanizing issue as total restructuring, but still difficult. I think you got to look at it more from a going-forward standpoint. It is clear at least to the commission there\u2019s been some very positive support for renewables. So you are aware that the state currently has its renewables standards on hold, legislatively, there\u2019s a lot to talk about what should be done there. But part of that smart city commitment on the part of AEP or proposal was the fact that 900 megawatts of renewable that was in the stipulation associated with the PPA, we did not pull down. So there\u2019s every opportunity for the commission to endorse both from a supportive restructuring standpoint that renewable. And that was split between solar and wind, about 500 and 400, if I remember. I mean, the other thing that\u2019s out there is clearly Marcellus and Utica Shale gas. I mean, there is clear a desire from a standpoint of growing the state\u2019s economy to build out the infrastructure associated with \u2013 in supporting infrastructure like a combined cycle gas plant. So we\u2019d like to think that from of structuring standpoint that Ohio could work to make a development-related opportunity for Utica part of that whole restructuring process. That\u2019s the way I\u2019d kind of handicap it. Nick Akins : There\u2019s a clarity of message here because it started out with a focus of reregulation, which meant customers didn\u2019t have a choice. All of the generation would be slammed back into the wires company, those kinds of connotations. We really refocused it on restructuring, which our customers would continue to have some level of choice. We would potentially transfer assets back into the wires company, but that remains to be seen. We don\u2019t want to encumber the forward view and the ability to invest in resources of the future in Ohio and for the headline to be trying to put coal plants back into AEP Ohio rate base. And so it is a tradeoff that's occurring there. We're obviously going to continue to try to find a home for those assets, but it'll be strategically reviewed just like the other assets. But we don't want to be, we want to be very clear and consistent in the message to legislators and so forth about the future of AEP in Ohio is driven by the outcome of restructuring and the commission's view of where we're trying to get to in terms of movement toward resource of the future and the technology deployment associated with these riders in clean city and all that kind of stuff. So we want to make sure that the message remains very clear on that. Gregg Orrill : Gregg Orrill, Barclays. Just a clarifying question on the Ohio Electric Security Plan. Is that in the guidance, the extension there, including the distribution rider? And also, do think you'll be able to spend the targeted amounts in that plant? Nick Akins : Brian? Brian Tierney : Yes and yes. Nick Akins : Yes. So I think if it gets you there is, yes, it's included in the plan in its present form. But if this really takes off like it should, then there's additional opportunities available there as well. Gregg Orrill : On the restructuring? Nick Akins : On the restructuring, but also on the investment in the grid itself. Will Zhang : Will Zhang with LNZ Capital. On slide 26, what's driving the $0.20 of higher growth in 2018 as compared to the $0.13 of growth in the other years? Lisa Barton : So let's say, sorry, you're on 26? Will Zhang : Yes. Lisa Barton : So what you're seeing with respect to '17 because I think that's really where the big difference is, that's where you're seeing some of the impact of bonus depreciation. You're seeing that actually in all years, but the network system, peak load delta as well as O&M is hitting in '17 and that's resolved in '18. Brian Tierney : By flowing through the formula rate, right? Lisa Barton : Yes. Nick Akins : And just the acceleration of earnings from the projects that are being put in place as well. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you very much for the three year look forward on earnings. Just by segment, how much of this capital, how firm is this capital? And how confident are you that there's not going to be some snags at being able to deploy it? And then, secondly, I appreciate you didn't buy back stock because you do have these opportunities out there and you've probably downside, asymmetric downside, list to, on cost of capital going forward here. So how should we think about the balance sheet for the next 3 years? Are you just going to run underlevered and then grow into that leverage as you deploy the capital? And then, I guess, just one follow-up. What's the status on when you're going to start spending money on smart meters in Ohio? Nick Akins : Bob, you can address the smart meter question. We're going to do that first and then we'll do it soon. Robert Powers : That application has been in for a long time, and again, I offered by optimism that there's been constructive dialogue with staff on a number of issues including that grid smart, smart meter deployment along with self-healing circuits and Volt-VAR optimization. So we're very optimistic that we'll see some of it from the commission soon. Can we spend in '16? Can we spend in '16? I'd like to have an order first. Nick Akins : In terms of the as far as the capital deployment in each area, we're very confident of the capital that's being managed in that plan. Those plans exist, and certainly, we want to make absolutely sure and we wanted to make sure that when we gave the new cone of 5% to 7%, that it wasn't aspirational, that it was focused on existing projects and existing confirmation of what we felt like we can achieve. And I think Chuck gave you a little bit of insight, too, in his messaging of we could have done more. But we wanted to stay conservative in our approach about the expansion of that part of the business. And of course, when you tell Lisa you got another $1.6 billion you need to spend, you have to get the engine going to address that. The fact that she could is a great testament. But as time goes on, certainly, the ability to take on even more projects may became prevalent. Lisa, you may want to respond to that. Lisa Barton : So it's known that there'll probably be a bit of cash out there for a little bit of time. So from a transition standpoint, we've been preparing for that. We're basically scoping about $3.5 billion worth of projects, and that's really to make sure that projects are ready to go on a going forward basis. So across the system, that's what we're doing. We're also being very aggressive with our RTOs and talking about needed projects that are there. Those numbers are not in the forecast that you see. Brian Tierney : In terms of the balance sheet, yes, our planned spend was to consume some of that capacity that we have. Also, what you saw the board do with the increase in the dividend in the middle part of the payout range starts to consume some of the capital that we have. And we had anticipated becoming a cash taxpayer in 2018, which we haven't been for some time now. If the sale of the assets go through, we'll be very fortunate to have the opportunity to pay some cash taxes in 2017. Nick Akins : So when we step out of this room and its ongoing now, but it's focused on execution around the plan we put together for you today, but also it's about expanding the additional earnings capability of the company going forward through not only Chuck's business, but channel growth associated with our customers. And that really goes to a lot of the smart meter applications, but also all those activities around optimization of the grid and so forth. So there's some great investment potential out there strategically, but we'll have to execute in the meantime and that's why that plan exists. Jim von Riesemann : Jim von Riesemann from Mizuho. Two questions. The first question is on actual trends. It's following up to Paul's question. How much can you actually invest a year in transmission? Meaning, what are the structural impediments in terms of people, man hours, etcetera, to do transmission? And the second question is different. Is there anything in the financing plan that we need to think about from a tax, like tax equity section 174, credits under pilot programs or something, to help you with the financing? Nick Akins : Yes, certainly. Lisa, you can address the transmission piece. But I think one of the challenges that and I ask the same question of Lisa quite frequently and a lot of it is just plain and simple of getting the outages to be able to put this equipment in place. And you had a massive reinvestment that's occurring in our part of the grid. So it's really focused on optimizing those outages to ensure that we are able to expand and grow and invest. But at the same time, you have the very real issues of resources deployed, project management to be able to deploy that many projects. But Lisa, you may want to expand on that. Lisa Barton : Sure. Thanks, Nick. We're very comfortable wit the $3 billion and that's why it's $3 billion out there as opposed to a different number. With respect to how we're positioning ourselves, I mentioned that we're targeting to have more projects scoped than the $3 billion. That's gives us a little bit of a cushion. We always have to be concerned, as Nick mentioned, with respect to outages and so forth. And that's why having more projects in the pipeline helps us adjust and be flexible with respect to those outages. We have been very aggressive in terms of making sure that we have locked in engineering resources. Over the next several years, we have a relationship with a number of Tier 1 engineering companies as well as engineering and construction companies to make this happen. Because we're the largest developer of transmission in the company -- in the country, excuse me, we have those relationships with labor. We have those relationships with our suppliers, which helps us set forward that plan of execution. Brian Tierney : Unless my colleagues are aware of the response to the tax question, we'll have to get back to you on that. Nick Akins : Next question. We have a full circle. Andrew Levi : It's Andy Levi again of Avon Capital. So the question has got to do with M&A, but I just -- before I get into that, I just want to compare and contrast before you answer it. So if you look at the Analyst Day we went to a lot of us went to yesterday, Southern Company where, obviously, they've been on a buying binge. The reality is that their core utility is only growing 2% organically and that's why they went on this buying binge. And a lot of the growth that they're seeing is through acquisition and they paid up for that acquisition. Then we look at your story where you're growing actually much more than them, 5% to 7% versus 5%. And all your growth is organic and which is obviously what we prefer as investors. And so I think the story is a very good story going forward. But as well, you kind of opened the door a little bit to potentially looking at an M&A transaction. And where prices are today, I think it would be kind of crazy for you to do that. And then I said... Nick Akins : I'm not buying back my stock. Andrew Levi : But your stock would be actually a lot less and it would pay 25 times earnings. I just want to make sure that we're very clear that you're not out there shopping and that you're focused on the organic growth and that you have this really good growth story and that there's no need for that. I just want to make sure that you answer the question. Nick Akins : Okay, great question. So the way we look at it is this, and I repeatedly said over the years, it has been a process of ours to become more regulated to see the multiple expansion, to improve our currency value, to give us optionally around M&A type of activity. But I'll say I mean and Chuck said this when he looked when he's talking about the investment from a renewables perspective being very selective. We've defined a threshold level, and that threshold level is centered on our ability to indigenously invest in our own company. And you look at the amount to depreciations occurring versus the amount of investment, we're buying a company every year, but we're doing it without a premium. And that's the way that we look at it. So unless there is some \u2013 and you never want to say no, because unless there\u2019s some strategic opportunity that really is beneficial to what we\u2019re trying to achieve for the future, it\u2019s going to have to measure against our threshold level, which is very high. Now I\u2019m not going to comment on other companies and where they\u2019re at. They're investing because they need to invest to grow and they\u2019re investing in different things. We don\u2019t have to do that. That\u2019s why I keep saying AEP is unique from that perspective, because we do have the indigenous growth. We have the ability to invest in transmissions, by the way, that\u2019s more than our customers within our indigenous territory that pay for the transmission. So that\u2019s a real opportunity for us to continue to invest from that perspective. So I\u2019m just saying that you never say never, but there\u2019s a very high threshold. In that high threshold, we thoroughly understand the point that you\u2019re making. Michael Lapides : Nick, Brian, Michael Lapides of Goldman. Thank you for allowing the follow-ups. Two questions. One, Brian, can you just give for \u201817, \u201818 and \u201819, the expectation for bonus D&A. And I want to make sure I understand because your CapEx is going up so your bonus D&A should be going up and yet you\u2019re commenting about being a federal cash taxpayer? Brian Tierney : Yeah. So we\u2019re going to be a modest taxpayer in 2017 if we end up closing the transaction that\u2019s been announced. And then we will slowly become an increasing taxpayer over the next several years it\u2019s a significant number approaching $1 billion of cash taxes on an annual basis. The assumptions that you would expect for bonus depreciation, given the CapEx that we have, are \u2013 as bonus depreciation decreases, we factor that into our capital plans. Michael Lapides : Got it. So in other words, bonus D&A lowers rate base but you don\u2019t get the corresponding benefit of not being a cash taxpayer in the interim? Brian Tierney : We start becoming a cash taxpayer. Michael Lapides : Okay. Nick, on Ohio, the wires business, I kind of like to think of things in a normal operating environment, kind of think about what\u2019s a normal earnings power. You\u2019re earning 13% ROEs in Ohio, that\u2019s healthy. How do you think investors should kind of value that? Should they capitalize that number? Is that kind of a normal operating environment? Should they assume, hey, you have that for x number of years and if so, what\u2019s your kind of view of how long? And then eventually, that changes. Just curious about how you kind of think about what normal in Ohio wires is? Nick Akins : Well, I think, generally, from the wires perspective, we have a very, very positive relationship with the commission that\u2019s focused on addressing what everyone believes, including our customers, of what the advancement of the system should be. Our transmission business is very robust in Ohio as well. So I don\u2019t see any reason for that to let up because, again, we\u2019re spending on the right things in Ohio from wires a perspective. We\u2019re spending on augmented by transmission from the Transco perspective in Ohio. So I feel good about that part of the business from an Ohio perspective. What needs work is and to further enhance that earnings capability is to be able to invest in generation in Ohio, and of course, the new applications, the smart city type of applications. But I think the commission's on board with that. I fully expect a positive result on that. But I really, they see the future we see in terms of investment in the grid, investment in the quality of customer service. Those are areas where you just can't go wrong. From a resource perspective, there's no question that customers are expecting a cleaner energy future, and right now, there's no way to invest in renewables in Ohio. And that has to be fixed. And along with that, everyone wants to see expansion from a natural gas perspective and the infrastructure and the economic development, the jobs, taxes, and that's not going to happen. It'll happen in the tempered sense. I mean, obviously, there are investors that will come in on a spec and build some, but not near about what should be getting built in Ohio to provide that energy future. So I just see upside from an Ohio perspective at this point. Julie Sherwood : So we have time for two more questions here. Michael Lapides : This is for Lisa. Just to clarify on the 205 and 206, the 206 was filed on AEP East, I think you said. And then, the 205, is that also just on AP East? Is that broader? And how should we think about the West within this whole framework? Lisa Barton : Yes, just on the East. And in terms of the West, I mean, it's the same question, I guess, that's out there tomorrow, which was there yesterday. Michael Lapides : And what's the current allowed on the West? Is it the same or is it different? I should know. Lisa Barton : I'm sorry? Michael Lapides : What's the allowed ROE kind of... Caroline Dorsa : 11.2% and that includes the 50 basis point adder. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: I'll close out by coming full circle here about that. Julien, UBS. So perhaps going back to Andy's question a little bit but trying to tie in rate cases as well, you own probably the smaller utilities in a number of other states, let's call it minority position. Does that actually make you more of a seller of certain assets to a certain extent? Like, for instance, to tie it back to your strategy in Kentucky. I heard some ambiguity as to what exactly you do, value a wide range of things. What do you do, for instance, in Kentucky or with respect to Arkansas? Nick Akins : So everybody likes to pick on Kentucky. I call it the little engine that could, because it's our first plant transfer that occurred there from Ohio. It has the first cyber-related rider. But that being said, now that we're fully regulated, there's probably a lot more optionally around decisions to optimize any portfolio. I'm not saying we're selling. I'm not saying we're buying. What I'm saying is, is that we position ourselves where we can be much more comfortable and objective about the decisions being made. We're fully regulated. We intend on staying fully regulated. What that means in terms of buys or sales says that we're going to be fully regulated. And so we now look at the individual jurisdictions through the equalizer chart. We know exactly where each state stands, each jurisdiction. We know the investment potential associated with that jurisdiction. Some may lag for some period of time because of the investment that's occurring. But as long as the average works out where we're, that utility rate of return of 10% or so forth, I think that's what we're after. The fact of the matter is, though, that we can more objectively look at that. So if there's a jurisdiction that's an underachiever for a long period of time and we can't see a view towards it getting better, then it more easily falls in the category of making those kinds of decisions than it did before because we had unregulated sitting out there. And if we sold any regulated, we'd become more unregulated and that's not the direction that we were going. So today, I'm just saying we can be very objective with a high threshold of what those changes can be. It's really a great position to be in from my opinion. Any other question? Okay, well, thank you very much for attending today.",

For the conference, all participant lines are in a listen-only mode. There will be an opportunity for your questions. Instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded. I\u2019ll to turn the conference over to Ms. Bette Jo Rozsa. Please go ahead. Bette Jo Rozsa : Thank you, John. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the fourth quarter 2016 earnings call for American Electric Power. We appreciate you taking the time to join us today. Our earnings release, presentation slides and related financial information are available on our website, at aep.com. Today, we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors. Joining me this morning for opening remarks are Nick Akins, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Brian Tierney, our Chief Financial Officer. We will take your questions following their remarks. I will now turn the call over to Nick. Nick Akins : Thanks, Bette Jo. Good morning, everyone, and thank you, once again, for joining AEP\u2019s fourth quarter 2016 earnings call. I\u2019m very pleased to report that AEP finished the year off strong with GAAP earnings coming in at $0.76 per share and operating earnings at $0.67 a share versus $0.96 per share and $0.48 per share, respectively, in fourth quarter 2015. This brings the year-to-date earnings to $1.24 per share GAAP and $3.94 per share operating for the year compared to $4.17 per share and $3.69 per share, respectively, for 2015. So, overall, finishing up strong in 2016 due to some tax-related settlements. Of course, the GAAP difference between 2015 and 2016 was primarily driven by the write-off we took in third quarter 2016 of the mainly Ohio competitive generation. This was a year of reducing risk and volatility of earnings for the company in the future and reinforcing our balance sheet to provide a strong platform for future growth. We also increased our dividend 5.4% in 2016 and improved our overall regulated operating ROE. As you know, we set operating guidance for 2017 at $3.55 to $3.75 per share with the $3.65 mid-point due to the rebasing after the unregulated generation asset sale and establishing a long-term future growth rate of 5 to 7%. We continue to reaffirm this guidance range and long-term growth rate. Load growth, as Brian will discuss in more detail later, was positive for the first quarter in over a year but was still minimal. So we continue to watch the economy closely particularly now that we have a new presidential administration with a pro-growth agenda. President Trump\u2019s focus of enhancing the ability for manufacturing industries to thrive and produce jobs, well that's AEP\u2019s service territory, his focus on balance portfolio of energy resources including fossil fuels that's also AEP\u2019s service territory. So as I said before the election whether focused on the Clean Power Plan as in Hillary Clinton\u2019s proposals or President Trump\u2019s proposals, AEP should prosper and we are very much looking forward to working with the Trump administration to bring prosperity and jobs back to this country. There are several key areas regarding Trump initiatives that make us optimistic concerning the future of AEP, namely focus on infrastructure development, including the electric system, truly all of the above strategies regarding generation resources, reduction of regulatory burdens for permitting etcetera, expansion of the US manufacturing base, security of the nation, in our case cyber and physical security and the creation of jobs overall. All of these bode well for AEP service territory and the economy as a whole. And of course, tax reform is on everyone's mind but because we have positioned AEP well with relatively little debt at the parent level and a strong balance sheet metrics as well, AEP should be in good shape based on our analysis of potential outcomes. Brian will discuss this issue in more detail in a few minutes. 2016 has been a pivotal year for AEP. Three years ago we were talking to you all about the daunting task ahead of us in light of the Ohio moved to deregulation and there was a legitimate concern whether AEP can deliver a 2016 that met our objectives of consistent earnings growth and dividend growth trajectory which is the hallmark of our premium regulated energy company. I'm very proud of our employees, management and Board to work together to deliver strong operating results in the face of the headwinds that occurred during the years preceding 2016. This has been a year of repositioning and derisking the company to provide a firm foundation for financial stability, earnings and dividend growth as well as a refocus on our customer. We have come through with flying colors but as a premium energy regulated company, our work is far from done. Yes, there have been challenges but there is no question AEP has set a firm foundation for the future and I personally feel really good about that. So let's talk about a few of the things that are ongoing. First, regarding the disposition of the sale of the competitive generation Ohio, the first group of generation, which we formally called the non-PPA assets, that has been sold to Lightstone should be completed very soon. We just obtain the FERC approval for transfer as well as other prerequisites for the sale and expect that to happen very soon. I just want to take a moment to thank the employees of Gavin, Lawrenceburg, Darby and Waterford, who have made those generating stations what they are today and for being patient through a process that I know has been challenging to say the least. It should be over very soon with the baton of leadership been passed to the capable hands of Lightstone, we wish you all the very best in the future. The strategic process also continues for the remaining competitive assets formally called the PPA assets. We continue to be in discussions with the other co-owners to make decisions regarding retirement, consolidation of interest and/or sales to complete this process. We expect this process to be completed sometime in 2017. Second, regarding industry restructuring in Ohio, we are having discussions with utilities and other stakeholders concerning proposed legislation to allow the utilities to continue to invest in generation resources in the state of Ohio. AEP will not invest in new generation in Ohio unless we have a clear path to recovery of our investment, so enabling legislation is critical. Because AEP in its shareholders have already taken a write-down on these assets, our focus is forward-looking and additive to the earnings capability of this company is successful. The process continues on pace and we expect the result from our efforts in 2017. More to come on this subject as we progress during the year. Notwithstanding the generation issue in Ohio during the fourth quarter, we were successful in a global settlement with the parties on several outstanding cases. Some of which have been outstanding for years thereby eliminating risk to AEP Ohio into the future. Ron will also cover these settled cases in his comments. It is a great outcome because it really does provide us a clean slate in Ohio from which to continue to build our positive business case around wires related activities in Ohio such as transmission, distribution, smart grid, renewables, etcetera. So with that, let us move to the equalizer graph. That's on page five of the package. So you can see that our overall regulated ROE is currently at 10.7%, mainly driven by weather, a little help from weather and some one-time regulatory adjustments and tax adjustments. So really a good ROE for the quarter. Generally, we focus on these being around normally 10% level, so \u2013 and you'll see the different companies go up and down based upon where they're at in terms of ratemaking or in terms of activities that they may have ongoing from an O&M perspective. But obviously, some progress is continuing to be made relative to our regulatory recovery. You'll see that a couple of them are pretty low, Kentucky and PSO, not surprising that they'll be going in for rate cases, so I'll cover that as we go individually into each one of these companies. Regarding Ohio Power the ROE for AEP Ohio is \u2013 at the end of the fourth quarter was 13.9%. That was primarily due to rate relief associated with the distribution investment program, shared savings attributed to the energy efficiency programs and the annual transmission formula rate true-up. APCo, which stands at 10.3%, is obviously doing very well, primarily due to favorable taxes and continued efforts from the one-time recognition of forward billing in West Virginia and then also an increase in weather-related usage. Base rates remain frozen in Virginia as a result of the February 2015 rate freeze law, but everything is going fine there as well. Kentucky obviously is pretty low at 7.5%. We continue close fiscal management of the O&M expenses in Kentucky. Obviously, we are trying to react to some of the recovery associated with these expenses. The ROE is at or near our projected peak with current rates. So the company will need to address this shortfall with a base rate application in 2017. I&M achieved an ROE of 11.7% at the end of the fourth quarter 2016. I&M continues to benefit from strong revelatory frameworks in place for major capital programs across all of its business units. For 2016, I&M\u2019s earnings were positively impacted by multiple one-time tax and accounting adjustments and sales being up across all retail customer segments. PSO \u2013 that also has an ROE that\u2019s pretty low at 8.5%, the declining ROE is primarily due to the rate relief granted by the OCC in its December final order, which was less than anticipated. PSO is in the process of preparing their next base rate case, which would be filed mid-year in response to that. SWEPCO continues to be at 7.4%, and that range has come up a little bit. But it continues to be challenged by the weakness in oil and gas prices. You may have seen an article yesterday about Louisiana being in recession regarding to oil and gas activities. So SWEPCO is obviously feeling the brunt of that and weakness in industrial load and rate settlement with wholesale customers. They are nevertheless filing \u2013 and filed December 16 to update its Texas rates and also working on Louisiana formula based rate as well. So they are \u2013 and some transmission related activities as well. So \u2013 and there was also some intentional spending around tree trimming in those types of activities there that we needed to do and some increased O&M as well in their budget. So it is a work in progress there. And then as far as AEP Texas, the ROE for AEP Texas at end of fourth quarter was 11.7% which they got approval of DCRF, Distribution Cost Recovery Factor filing which is the first one they filed into that new regime in Texas and obviously turned out a good outcome. And then also they are experiencing some 3.1% normalized load growth over 2015 with all sectors seeing favorable load growth, so, obviously, a growing part of the territory. AEP Transmission HoldCo, the ROE for AEP Transmission at the end of fourth quarter is 12.1%, which is driven by the ETT ROE of 12.35% and Transco ROE of 11.22%. So an ETT\u2019s 2016 ROE is certainly exceeding its authorized ROE of 9.96% so be the lower interest been, lower property taxes and no impact of accumulated deferred income tax and rate base. So they are doing very well from a transmission perspective. So that really goes to the overall 10.7%, obviously, the companies are doing well. We are working on the ones that we believe there's a path towards improvement and we will continue that effort. So to wrap up, 2016 was a very successful year for AEP. 2017 will be another transformational year and then you would ask why. You're now a fully regulated utility. You\u2019ve made the transition but the truth be known, we spent a lot of time and energy trying to make a volatile unregulated business along with our core business growth produce outcomes consistent with the earnings and dividend growth of a fully regulated company. We are largely successful in that endeavor but risk fundamentals had to change. So, obviously, there was never any doubt about it but just in respective of passing of Mary Tyler Moore, I will just say, we are going to make it after all. And that something I think that we will continue to strive for as we change this company. AEP has to continue to reinvent ourselves to remain relevant to our customers by investing in infrastructure and technological innovation as well as dramatically improving the customers experience as we move to a cleaner energy future. This is obviously a different focus and a different American Electric Power, the premium regulated energy company. Brian. Brian Tierney : Thank you, Nick, and good morning, everyone. I will take us through the financial results for both the quarter and the year. I will also provide some insight on load in the economy, review our balance sheet strength and liquidity position, discuss potential tax reform impacts and finish with a preview of 2017. Let's begin on Slide 6, which shows that operating earnings for the fourth quarter were $0.67 per share or $330 million compared to $0.48 per share or $233 million for 2015. As you can see, all of our regulated segments experienced growth for the quarter compared to last year. As did our competitive generation and marketing business. The growth in our regulated businesses was driven by positive weather impacts, a lower effective tax rate and rate impacts that reflected increased investment to serve our customers. The quarterly comparison in the transmission and distribution utilities segment was negatively impacted by a global regulatory settlement that we recently filed in Ohio. However, this settlement closes 17 cases and largely clears the deck of lingering historical rate cases. Many associated with regulatory transition in the state. Hearings on the settlement were earlier this week and we expect an order before February 28. The agreement covers the capacity pricing case, the retail stability writer case, the Phase-In Recovery Rider case, the double counting of capacity issue, and several historical fuel cases, as well as two significantly excessive earnings test cases. We appreciate the hard work of interveners and commission staff to help resolve these issues globally. Now, we have a healthy AEP Ohio wires company with little financial overhang from the regulatory transition. It was a long road, but we have finally arrived at a steady state of electric utility regulation in Ohio. AEP Ohio will focus is capital investment on transmission and new distribution technologies to improve reliability to better serve our customers. For the quarter the Generation and Marketing segment improved $0.08 per share over last year, due to lower depreciation expense from the competitive units, as well as increased earnings from our retail business. Corporate and Other was down $0.01 per share largely from the sale of our River Operations business in 2015. Turning to Slide7, our annual operating earnings were $3.94 per share or $1.9 billion compared to $3.69 per share or $1.8 billion in 2015. Similar to the quarterly comparison, all or our regulated segments experienced growth for the year, however the sale of our River Operations business in 2015 and the expected revenue challenges in our competitive generation and marketing business combined for a $0.31 drag on the annual comparison. The growth in our regulated segments was largely driven by rate changes from recovery of incremental investment to serve our customers, increased earnings in our transmission business, a lower effective tax rate and weather. For several years now our employees have been planning for the revenue challenges associated with the full transition to market in Ohio. Looking at the annual results for the competitive generation and marketing segment, it is clear how dramatic these challenges were for 2016 alone recognizing that this was the final year of a multiyear transition. Looking at this slide, it is equally how well the women and men of American Electric Power have responded to the challenge. Through continuous improvement, strategic procurement initiatives and spending discipline, they have reinvested in our regulated businesses to better serve our customers. I am proud and grateful for what they've accomplished over the last several years. Now, let's take a look at Slide 8 to review normalized load performance. Starting with the lower rate chart, our normalized retail sales grew by 0.3% for the fourth quarter. As Nick said earlier, this was the first quarter in over a year where we experienced growth in overall retail sales. For the year, our normalized retail sales declined by 0.2% due to lower industrial sales, partially offset by growth in commercial sales. In the upper left chart, normalized residential sales were down 2% for the quarter, giving back some of the gains from earlier in the year. For the year, residential sales were essentially flat. Customer counts for the system were up 0.2% in 2016. The relatively strong growth in our Texas territory was offset by the week performance in the Appalachian coal regions. In the upper right chart, commercial sales grew by 2.6% for the quarter and ended the year up 0.9% compared to last year. For the quarter, every operating company posted positive growth in their commercial sales. For the year, the results were mixed but followed a similar pattern as described earlier for the residential sector, with the strongest growth coming from our transmission and distribution utilities segment. Finally, in the bottom left, industrial sales increased by 0.4% this quarter and ended the year down 1.4%. 2016 was a challenging year for manufacturing within our service territory with lower energy prices, a strong dollar and week global demand. We started to see slight improvement in these areas, as we finished the year and are more optimistic about our industrial sales class outlook for 2017. Slide 9 demonstrates how different the various regional economies of our service area performed throughout the year. On the top left of the slide, AEP\u2019s eastern service territories have experienced GDP growth of between 1.2% and 1.5% since the fourth quarter of 2015. This growth has trailed that of the U.S. by about 0.5 percentage point. This is not surprising, given the exposure that Kentucky and West Virginia have to coal mining. The textbook definition of a recession is a period with two or more consecutive quarters of GDP contraction. AEP\u2019s western service areas have been in recession throughout 2016. GDP growth was weakest in the second quarter of 2016 and has experienced modest improvement since. This mirrors the pattern of oil prices in 2016 and is not surprising given the high concentration of oil and gas activity in Oklahoma, Louisiana and Texas. Looking at the eastern vertically integrated utilities in the upper right, Indiana and Michigan Power Company has experienced strong GDP growth of between 2% and 3% in 2016, driven by its exposure to the growing auto industry. This is in contrast to Appalachian Power and Kentucky Power with their exposure to coal mining. Appalachian Power return to growth in the third quarter of 2016 and has been improving since. Kentucky Power has reduced its contraction in the fourth quarter and is forecasted to return to growth in the second quarter of this year. On the bottom left, both SWEPCO and Public Service of Oklahoma were in recession in 2016. SWEPCO returned to growth in the fourth quarter of 2016 and PSO is expected to do so in the first quarter of this year. Improving oil and natural gas prices are helping to lift these regional economies. This is expected to continue in 2017. Finally, looking at Transmission and Distribution Utilities on the bottom right, AEP Texas, which also has significant oil and gas exposure, was in a mild recession in 2016 but emerged in the fourth quarter as oil and gas prices rose. AEP Ohio on the other hand has been in expansion mode throughout 2016 driven by growth in the construction and healthcare sectors. It is interesting to note that over 70% of all jobs added in our service area in 2016 have been in Ohio and Texas. Now let's move on to Slide 10 and review the company's capitalization and liquidity. Our debt to total capital ratio increased by 8/10 of a percent during the quarter to 55.9%. The asset impairment in the third quarter of 2016 had about a 200 basis point impact on this ratio. Our credit metrics, FFO interest coverage and FFO to debt are solidly in the BBB and BAA1 range at 5.8 times and 20.2% respectively. Our qualified pension funding improved a percentage point to 96%. Although plan assets decreased during the quarter, plan liabilities decreased more primarily due to the sharp rise in the discount rate in November. Our OPEB funding improved 3 percentage points to the end of the year to end the year at 107%. November sharp increase in the discount rate benefited our OPEB funding more than our pension funding due to the lower fixed income allocation in OPEB assets. Plan assets decreased by 4% during the quarter, while plan liabilities decreased by 7%. The estimated after-tax O&M expense for both plans for 2017 is expected to be about $15 million. Finally, our net liquidity stands at about $2.7 billion and is supported by our two revolving credit facilities. Nick mentioned earlier that the sale of the competitive assets is expected to close in the very near future. Let me give some color on the immediate use of cash from the sale. The cash coming in the door will be approximately $2.2 billion. We will refund approximately $1 billion of commercial paper, repay the $500 million AEP generation resources term loan facility, as well as about $200 million in debt associated with the Lawrenceburg generating facility. This activity will leave us well positioned to execute our capital plan and is expected to improve our debt-to-total-capitalization ratio by about 200 basis points. Turning to Slide 11, we have gotten a number of questions regarding tax reform since the likelihood of it actually happening has increased. As many of you know, I profess to be intellectually challenged in regard to tax issues, but I will share with you AEP\u2019s expected positioning as explained to me by our tax experts. First, in regard to the prospect of the elimination of interest expense deductibility, AEP has less than $1 million of debt that is not subject to rate regulation. The majority of the debt we hold is at the operating company level where the elimination of deductibility would be mitigated through the ratemaking process. Second, in regards to the prospect of negative rate base implications of 100% capital expense deductibility, AEP has ample organic growth opportunities. Just as we did a little over year ago with the expansion of bonus depreciation, we would seek to use the cash freed up to reinvest in our system for the benefit of our customers. Third, AEP has very few unused tax credits that were accumulated under the current tax rates which would be negatively impacted by the prospect of a lower corporate tax rate. Fourth, assuming the elimination of interest expense deductibility, the 100% deductibility of capital expenditures, the elimination of the manufacturing tax credit and AEP\u2019s low level of non-rate regulated debt, AEP's breakeven 10-year average tax rate would be 22%. This is positive since a reduction in the rate to 20% level is being discussed. Finally, let's look at the potential access regulated deferred federal income taxes at a 20% rate on the right-hand side of the slide. Today our regulated deferred FIT balance is $10.5 million. At a 20% rate $4.3 billion would be excess, but $3.3 billion of that would be depreciation related and would be expected to flow back over the life of the property. This would leave about $1 billion in unprotected access that we\u2019d need to flow back to our customers over some negotiated period of time. We would make the case that we should flow this excess back to customers at a pace consistent with the originally expected reversal period. In 1986, we negotiated flow-back periods of between 2 and 18 years. In total, we believe that a globally competitive tax rate is good for the American businesses that we serve with some legislative adjustments for our historically regulated utility with some reasonable jurisdictional treatment of excess deferred tax flow-back to customers. And with AEP\u2019s current low-risk balance sheet, we believe the company is competitively positioned for the prospect of corporate tax reform. We are actively engaged with industry peers and legislators and trying to sleep legislation that is both positive for the country and takes into account the idiosyncrasies of our regulated industry. With that overview, please save your really hard tax questions for Betty Jo. Let\u2019s try to wrap up my remarks on Slide 12. We began 2017 with a strong track record. Regulated earnings were strong in 2016, as we continue to invest capital in our regulated businesses to better serve our customers. For several years, we have maintained O&M discipline and kept spending in a tight range of between $2.8 billion and $3.1 billion. We expect to remain in that range this year. In addition, over time, we have grown our dividend with earnings and expect to be able to do so going forward. Last year, AEP\u2019s Board of Directors increased the dividend 5.4% on an annual basis. Looking ahead to 2017, we are reiterating our guidance of $3.55 to $3.75 per share. Back in November, we indicated that we anticipated about $0.09 per share in 2017 earnings from the assets we expect to sell and we assumed a sale date of March 31. As Nick said earlier, we expect to sell those assets in the very near future, and this creates a few cents of earnings that we will need to offset. In 2016, we demonstrated our ability to execute on our capital plan by investing $4.93 billion. In 2017, we anticipate investing $5.7 billion in capital, 95% of that in regulated businesses and 76% in wires. With that, I will turn the call over to the operator for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And first one, Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Greg Gordon : Thanks. Great end of the year, guys. Good numbers. I only have one question and 27 parts on tax reform. The $2.2 billion cash coming in, you gave us $1.1 billion paying down CP, $0.5 billion for another tranche of debt and $200 million for another tranche, so that does leave some excess cash. Should we assume that gets consumed in a normal course of business for capital and dividends? Brian Tierney : It does, Greg. We also anticipate being a tax payer by dent of the transaction so we anticipate quarterly tax payments as well and those would begin in the first quarter. Greg Gordon : Okay. And just to be clear on your comments you made on tax, out of the gate if reform were to take the form that you use as your base case there, there would initially be a headwind associated with the return of rate base capital. But you think that you could, as most companies did in 2016, when bonus depreciation was extended, find enough customer-friendly projects to invest in that talks at that? I just want to be clear that's what you are saying. Brian Tierney : We do, Greg, and we believe that would be for our capital spend a fairly modest percentage increase. Greg Gordon : Okay. That was going to be my next question. Could you size the quantum of how much you would have to increase your capital spend every year to offset that? Brian Tierney : Call it between $300 million and $400 million. Greg Gordon : Perfect. Thank you, guys. Thanks a lot. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Ali Agha with SunTrust. Please go ahead. Ali Agha : Thank you. Good morning. Brian, can you just quantify, what were the drivers for the lower-than-expected tax in the fourth quarter? And what's the effective tax rate we should assume, 2017 and beyond? Brian Tierney : Perfect Ali. So we said overall that the tax impact for the year was $0.17 when you include corporate and other in that as well when you are not breaking it out by segment that impact comes down to about $0.13. And let me break out for you what the composition of that is. Resolution of prior period audits was about $0.02 per share. There was a Texas policy change that allowed for a lower taxable income that included a deduction for T&D expense that added about $0.04, some tax planning that we did that allowed some prior period charitable deductions to come through, added about $0.03 and then there were other currently accrued adjustments that mostly included tax to book differences accounted for on a flow-through basis that were about $0.04. So that's the composition of the $0.13 difference and the rate that we assume going forward is 35%. Ali Agha : Yes. And second question in terms of Nick you'd mentioned you are working with the Ohio legislature. Can you give a sense of what exactly what it is that you would like to see change and what the mechanics would be? Would that be a new bill that they would introduce or how would this work technically? Nick Akins : Yes. I mentioned AEP is sort of moving forward with a clean slate, so we really are focused on the ability to invest in new generation and its sort of a broad context, but certainly we want to be able to put renewables in place, perhaps natural gas, other forms of resources, distributed energy resources. Those are key areas for us in terms of the build-out of the \u2013 what we believe is the smart grid of the future and all the interoperability issues associated with it. So we want to have provisions that may be shrinking of the needs provision of the existing legislation, for example, to allow us a more prescriptive path to the commission for recovery of those expenses. So once we \u2013 we would file something for new resource of some kind and it would go through the commission proceedings and we would be. And certainly, we\u2019d like the legislation to be prescriptive in terms of how the commission deals with that, so that it would be very clear. So we're not winding up back at the Ohio Supreme Court all the time. That's really what we're after and some questions always come up about obligation to serve and that kind of thing, but really we're starting with a clean slate and we want to be able to \u2013 we now file these things as opposed to have some obligation to serve that looks like a re-regulation. So there's still a lot of discussions about that, but AEP certainly is focused on that provision. Because we're doing very well from the regulatory structure in Ohio relative to transmission distribution and the interface associated with that so we want to be able to augment that growth potential here in Ohio as well. Ali Agha : Yes. And last question Brian, I just wanted to clarify a point you'd made, the fact that the merchant asset sales will happen sooner than March 31 that should resume. Did I hear that you guys felt you could offset that earlier than expected sale with other efforts or that you are just pointing out that maybe that $0.09, $0.10 number may be lower, keeps you in the range, but we should consider that in our numbers. I just want to be clear what you were saying. Brian Tierney : It\u2019s the latter, Ali. The $0.09 that we had expected given the March 31 sale will be less. We\u2019re going to need to try to find a way to offset that, but we\u2019re still in the range. Ali Agha : I got it. Thank you. Operator : Next, we\u2019ll go to Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Jonathan Arnold : Good morning, guys. Just a quick question on sales. Brian, I think you said you were feeling more optimistic about 2017. But when I look at the analyst day, what you are forecasting now, it seems to be a little lower and then 2016 also came in a little lower. So could you just reconcile your comment about feeling better? Is that relative to the past or relative to coming in to the Analyst Day? Nick Akins : Relative to the past. So the slide that I took us through on the regional economies shows that through 2016 a lot of our service areas were in recession. But towards the end of 2016, they started to come out and started to show some growth. As we saw, oil and natural gas prices start to improve. We started to see improvement in the industrial regions that have exposure to oil and gas. If prices stay the same or continue to improve, we expect that trend to continue into 2017. Most of our growth in 2017 is forecasted to come from the industrial sector. Jonathan Arnold : Right, so would you say your forecast -- you feel more conservative -- your forecast more conservative relative to what you are actually seeing now or it's similar? Nick Akins : No. We think our forecast reflects what we\u2019re seeing right now, which is some improvement in industrial, particularly oil and gas. Brian Tierney : We\u2019re actually seeing a lot of oil and gas projects that aren\u2019t just being talked about. They\u2019re already in the pipeline and being \u2013 and under construction of some kind. So that tells us a lot about what will actually true-up in that stream of new projects that are occurring because when we started going down in 2016 we had all these projects and at the end of 2015 that we thought were coming in 2016 but they weren\u2019t materializing or at least there was a propensity to slow them down because obviously prices were coming down. But now we\u2019re seeing a different direction. So if you look at those underlying fundamentals relative to the automobile industry, relative to oil and gas activity starting to pick up and actually confirmed projects that are under construction, it makes you somewhat optimistic but at the same time, we are being very careful about this economy like we have been for several quarters now in terms of we really need to see a trend develop. Jonathan Arnold : Great. Thank you guys and if I could just following up on the Ohio legislation. Nick can you give us a little more sense of when in the year you would anticipate this coming together and is there -- do you already have a draft bill, do you know who might sponsor it? Or are we still at the more exploratory stage? Nick Akins : Yes, we are still in discussions with the other parties that would be involved with this thing and obviously all the utilities and others and really we have to get it nailed down on the provisions, all the provisions that will go into the bill and some parties are looking for different thing than others, so we have to manage through that process a little bit but the legislature obviously is being kept up to speed on what's going on and we are having regular meetings with leaders in the legislature. So nothing is going to happen that\u2019s really unknown at this point. I think really a major focus right now is not to burden the legislation with provisions that may slow it down because if you start talking about reregulation or obligation to serve, all those kinds of things, it just brings in more issues associated with how, okay, do you actually restructure this market, but if it's surgical in terms of its approach and actually there may be other surgical provisions of other companies want, let's put those together and move forward very quickly through the legislature. So I'm still thinking probably second quarter, we will have something that we can have someone sponsor. Jonathan Arnold : So Q2, a bill material and then we start to see the shape of it? Nick Akins : Yes, again, there's already drafts of legislation that are circulating around and we just need to make sure all the parties are comfortable with that. And so it is a work in progress with the new legislature as well here in Ohio and from AEP's perspective, like I said, its additive to our ability to invest in this state. We already have some measure of renewables that are in place and we have to bid for those and that kind of thing but this is really centered on ensuring that we're able to address really what Ohio wants to do regarding its energy future, and our part in it. And so, that's where it stands right now. Jonathan Arnold : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS. Please go ahead. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Good morning. Maybe to just follow-up on the last question to, if you permit me, you mentioned burdensome provisions. Can you elaborate a little bit? What would you not want to see as part of this that might get it dragged down vis-a-vis timing or ultimately palatability and I have got a few others. Nick Akins : Yes. I think from AEP's perspective and obviously you'll have to ask the others, but from AEP's perspective to try to have AEP Ohio responsible for capacity in the future. I mean, we sort of lived through that and done that and obviously if you try to have AEP Ohio responsible for capacity and having to go out or \u2013 because obviously we're in the process of selling our generation, so you could wind up in a situation where we have long-term large PPAs and that would be a balance sheet issue for AEP Ohio. So you think about that obligation and of course the obligation to serve in, and it becomes pretty onerous in terms \u2013 not only in terms of how we deal with the financial picture of AEP Ohio going forward, but also in terms of you're trying to restructure a market and everyone, if you try \u2013 if you put that \u2013 invest it back with the utilities then you would basically have to go through a whole lot of discussions with multiple parties of what does that mean and how do you deal with that completely different structure, short of re-regulation. So if it's more surgical in its approach in terms of new facilities or that kind of thing, then I think it's a lot easier. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it but no opposition to nuclear, for instance? Nick Akins : Well, I'll let FE speak on the nuclear point, but we'll say this from AEP's perspective, if there is support \u2013 and I don't call it like New York or Illinois, but if there is support in terms of ZEC or something like that for nuclear, I'm supportive of that being in legislation as long as ZEC gets attributable to FE's connected customers. And so, because we're a little different in Ohio than the other states. AEP Ohio doesn\u2019t have any nuclear and the others don\u2019t either. So I think you have to sort of think about that. But overall I\u2019m very supportive of nuclear. I think it\u2019s a travesty that these nuclear units are getting retired. And if there is any kind of state support that can be given to support these nuclear units, that\u2019s a good thing because this competitive market \u2013 we call it a market and PJM is not working for long-term base load capacity. So I really believe that there should be some \u2013 there can be some provision, but the cost of that can\u2019t be borne by our customers because AEP Ohio is moving toward its own set of resources including renewables. And we want to make sure that there is the ability for us to invest in relation to impact on customer rates. So that\u2019s really long answer to the short question, but I think it says a lot in terms of where things are going. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Right and if I may follow up on the Ohio side, obviously you've got a settlement here. You obviously posted pretty healthy ROEs. Can you just give us a little bit more of a summary in terms of what that settlement means vis-a-vis your prospective earnings and maybe just give us a little bit a sense of how you expect the cadence of your earnings at that subsidiary to proceed given where you stand today? Nick Akins : Yes. I think from AEP Ohio\u2019s perspective, it certainly clears out all the overhang associated with all these cases. So it really puts us in a great position I mean, obviously, the capacity of the Supreme Court \u2013 the Ohio Supreme Court had remanded back the issues on the capacity and the RSR payment, and it gets all that squared away. And then, of course, some other historical fuel cases are resolved too that had been hanging out for years and then as well as too excess of earnings there. So it really provides a clean slate going forward. So I fully expect AEP Ohio to continue to be a very good investment from a wires perspective. Transmission and distribution that we\u2019re trying to do \u2013 and I think the commission is somewhat responsive to this, and that is with the Smart Cities challenge in Columbus, we are working on interoperability with the grid, going back to transportation, and we want to be able to do that throughout our territories. But certainly Ohio and Columbus, Ohio, is central to that theme going forward. And I really believe we\u2019ll have a supportive commission in that regard. So I think that really bodes well for the investment potential in AEP Ohio, but also the benefits for customers and the commission should be very happy with that. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Great, thank you. Operator : Next we\u2019ll go to Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Paul Ridzon : Good morning, and congratulations on a solid year. Nick Akins : Thanks. Paul Ridzon : Looking at, I think it's slide 9, your economic forecast, you issued guidance November 1, before the election, before OPEC had cut production. Is there a tailwind now hidden in the midpoint of your guidance here. Obviously you've got one offset on the timing of the sale, the generation, but it looks like the world has improved since you gave guidance. Brian Tierney : Yes, so it has right, as you look at the trends of what's happened with GDPs there they seem to be coming from contraction into growth and we've reflected that in the update for our numbers. You will see on Slide 8, our numbers are slightly different than what they were on page 24 of our release at the Analyst Day but what that really reflects is the passage of another quarter, new data being updated and us looking at the dead reckoning forecast that we have for our service areas for 2017. Nick Akins : I think you have to look at is, I know business get repetitive quarter after quarter but these quarters are a snapshot in time that we don't see intuitively obvious long-term trends that we can really hang our head on in terms of how the year goes. So I would say if we continue to see bolstering activity in the second quarter and then we will continue looking at what that means in terms of load forecast and keep in mind too it's the mixture of load to. Weather -- if it's industrial load that's picking up, the margins on industrial load are much less than others. So you have to really look at this thing in the context of overall trends moving forward throughout the economy and will just have to take that quarter by quarter and make a determination. Paul Ridzon : And then, on your pension discussion, I missed it, you said there would be an expense of $15 million in 2017. What was that expense and what was it in 2016? Brian Tierney : It's the after-tax expense for both pension and OPEB, so it's after-tax O&M pension and OPEB, about $15 million and it was roughly the same in 2016. Paul Ridzon : That is 15? Brian Tierney : Yes. Paul Ridzon : And then a question from my tech analyst. Now that you have got Ohio pretty much cleaned up, when do you think you can start the AMI spend? Brian Tierney : Grid smart. Nick Akins : Yes, the grid smart, we were set for hearing, I think it was yesterday. They delayed it until next week. So we should get a decision then and be off and running. Paul Ridzon : Thank you very much. Operator : The next question is from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Stephen Byrd : Hi. Good morning. I just wanted a quick question on Ohio restructuring. In your discussion with the other utilities in the state, do have a sense that you all are on the same page? Are there still key issues that have to be resolved to make sure that you all are arm in arm as you think about legislation? Nick Akins : I think, I'd say, generally, we recognize we need to be arm in arm, but there's still outstanding issues that we need to resolve. And \u2013 but I really believe that the participants are motivated to move this process forward because they understand the importance of the restructuring effort here in Ohio. So I'd say the parties are motivated, but still there's issues that we have to resolve specifically related to if it's a surgical legislation. Stephen Byrd : Understood. And then tax reform, I think we are all trying to get our arms around the implications and the slide you laid out was very helpful. When we think about -- you laid out your breakeven tax rate at 22% and maybe just a dumb mechanical question, but there's some discussion that maybe the corporate tax rate goes down to 25% and not 20% or 15%. If it were at 25% instead of the 20%, could you just talk through some mechanically earnings power and other impacts from that kind of an outcome? Brian Tierney : Yes, so if it's 25% rather than 22% or less, it means that from a net income standpoint the takeaways that we would have from interest deductibility would not outweigh the reduction in the tax rate that we're talking about. Does that make sense? Stephen Byrd : Okay. So it would be a net drag compared to say a 22% or 20% outcome and we could try to mechanically how to trace that out? Brian Tierney : Correct. Stephen Byrd : Okay. That's all I had. Thank you very much. Operator : And next we\u2019ll go to Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Steve Fleishman : Good morning. Hi. First, thank you for setting a high bar on tax reform disclosures. We will see if others can get close to this, thanks. A couple questions. On the former PPA assets, could you give us an update on resolving the future of those? Nick Akins : Yes. On the former PPA assets, as I mentioned, we\u2019re talking to the other parties. And really it focuses on what the swap potential is and, of course, looking at units that may \u2013 I mean, you look at him and say, well, we should go ahead and retire them. And then if there is consolidation of interest, then is there a strategic process that needs to continue in some variation associated with those. And I would say those conversations are going very well. Timing of those conversations I still suspect we\u2019ll be completing something certainly in 2017. So obviously it\u2019s pretty complicated given that there is multiple owners. But also there is multiple issues to be dealt with in terms of how you move forward from whatever the result maybe of the discussions with the parties themselves. But I would say those conversations are going very good. Steve Fleishman : Okay. Secondly, just on the transmission business, you had that 206 filing. And then, I think, did you make the 205 filing? Nick Akins : We did. Steve Fleishman : Okay. Nick Akins : We did the 205 filing. Steve Fleishman : And is there any updates on either of those or is that just going to be a long process? Nick Akins : Yes. On the 205 filing, I think, we have \u2013 it's a March timeframe for, I guess, for the forecast to act and then the 206 filing that\u2019s still sitting out there. And it may be a couple years. But obviously that process will continue, if they decide to set it for hearing or whatever. But we haven\u2019t heard anything else on there. Steve Fleishman : And then lastly, is there any update on your renewables investment program that the $1 billion you are targeting. Are you, I think, obviously after your analyst day we had the Trump election win that was unexpected and the like. So I'm curious just how are you feeling about being able to get to the $1 billion of renewables that you are targeting? Brian Tierney : Yes. I think Chuck still has his $1 billion number out there. I think he is probably over a third of the way. But we\u2019re going to be very selective. And as I said earlier and we have our return thresholds that we expect, and we have not changed those return thresholds. He continues to be involved with projects and if he can't make it to $1 billion, he will give it back to us and we will put it somewhere else including transmission and other places. So I think we are going to continue with the same degree of discipline that we have today regardless of what happened to tax provisions or anything else and so it's not -- this is not where AEP is trying to form some major business. It really is focused on an augmentation that's disciplined and has a return expectation associated with it that actually contributes to what we are trying to achieve. So that process hasn't changed at all and Chuck continues to be involved with projects both solar and wind and we will continue with that. Steve Fleishman : Great, thank you. Operator : Next, we will go to Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead. Paul Patterson : Hi, how are you doing. So most of the questions have been answered, but I've just got a really basic one and that is, we've seen tax reform proposals before. Obviously this seems like it's got momentum to it and it doesn't -- it looks like you guys have, your disclosure is pretty clear and the impact doesn't look necessarily huge. But it's pretty disruptive in many ways, generally speaking, to different players. And I just was wondering, when you're looking at this and when you're talking to your people, what do you think the chances are and I know it's a tough -- I'm not holding you to it or anything. But what are the chances that we actually see something this dramatic being enacted? It just seems rather -- I don't know, we've seen it before and things don't usually happen like this. When you look at this landscape now, if you had to guess fifty-fifty, what would you say is the chance of this actually-- these proposals substantially getting enacted. Nick Akins : I wouldn\u2019t say -- I don't know that we've had a Trump administration before too, the pace at which he is moving already and I think a lot of these things have been pinned up for years and on its face you'll say it's pretty daunting to get tax reform done in these multiple things that we are talking about particularly when you take away interest expense deductibility and issues like that. That's going to be tough. I'm not saying that it can't get done because I think there's probably enough movement out there of a lot of companies who want to see that tax rate come down, and I think the importance of American industry going forward to be competitive internationally. I think that process will move forward and it becomes an issue of, okay, how do you pay for it? And that's where interest expense deductibility and all that kind of stuff comes in. As far as the industry is concerned, I still think right now the Trump Administration is dealing with ACA. They \u2013 the tax reform could come after that. Although, infrastructure seems to be a key issue as well. So it remains to be seen. I think it'll probably be later in the year before we really see things that we can really latch onto to fully understand where this thing is going and so we'll continue to look at our tax situation and consideration of that but it is something we'll watch very closely. And if it is a broad tax reform package, we probably dealt with in our analysis here, some of the extremes that would occur. If you take 100% expensing and interest expense deductions away, that's pretty considerable. So I think that's probably as much of a stress test as you're going to get. As far as the industry is concerned, and AEP's position, we would \u2013 we think that our industry is the most heavily \u2013 it is the capitalized industry by far of anyone in the US. And when you talk about interest expense deductibility and deductions and how the impact ultimately customers, you really have to think twice about that. So I really believe there ought to be a utility exception because we typically pass our rates through to customers and the benefits in there to manufacturing and other endeavors that we have for the economy. So whether that can get done or not is another question. But certainly we really have to look at those provisions and how it applies to our capital intensive industry. And we\u2019ll obviously be active in Washington associated with that thought as well. Operator : And that will be from the line of Anthony Crowdell with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Anthony Crowdell : Hi, thanks for squeezing me in, Nick. I appreciate it. I guess on Ohio restructuring, AEP is already taking the pain of getting rid of oil generation of the utility in the and maybe have not and AEP is looking more forward-looking with future generation needs potentially in this restructuring bill. Do you think we could see an Ohio back to what we had as we moved to market where the state gets split and the restructuring as differently in the northern part of the state than in the southern part of the state? Nick Akins : I really don't see that. I think you hit up on a point though that different companies may be looking for different provisions based upon where they stand today and somehow we\u2019ve got to make sure that an industry restructuring package is transparent enough and people will understand it well enough to accommodate some of these varied interests. And that\u2019s really \u2013 that\u2019s part of the challenge. And so we will just have to see how things work out from that perspective. Anthony Crowdell : Great. Thanks for taking my question. I\u2019m glad your blue jackets are relevant now. Nick Akins : Yes. I know. They are really relevant. Aren\u2019t they? Anthony Crowdell : Yes, they are. Nick Akins : It\u2019s only taken like two decades. Anthony Crowdell : Unfortunately, at the expense of my rangers, but yes. Bette Jo Rozsa : Well, thank you, everyone, for joining us on today\u2019s call. As always, the IR team will be available to answer any additional questions you may have. I guess that now includes tax. John, would you please give the replay information? Operator : Certainly. And, ladies and gentlemen, this conference is available for replay. It starts today at 11 :15 AM, Eastern Time, and will last until February 2, at midnight. You can access the replay at any time by dialing 800-475-6701 or 320-365-3844. The access code is 415052.

As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I'll turn the conference now over to Ms. Bette Jo Rozsa. Please go ahead. Bette Jo Rozsa - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Thank you, John. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the first quarter 2017 earnings call for American Electric Power. Thank you for taking the time to join us today. Our earnings release, presentation slides, and related financial information are available on our website at aep.com. Today, we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors. Our presentation also includes references to non-GAAP financial information. Please refer to the reconciliation of the applicable GAAP measures provided in the appendix of today's presentation. Joining me this morning for opening remarks are Nick Akins, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and, Brian Tierney, our Chief Financial Officer. We will take your questions following their remarks. I will now turn the call over to Nick. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Thanks, Bette Jo. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining AEP's first quarter 2017 earnings call. This quarter, AEP released earnings that are on track for the year despite mild winter weather and an earlier completion during the quarter of the merchant generation sale. So overall, we are very pleased with the outcome for the quarter and sets the tone for confirmation of our existing 2017 operating guidance range of $3.55 to $3.75 per share. We reported GAAP and operating earnings for first quarter 2017 coming in at $1.20 per share and $0.96 per share, respectively. This compares with first quarter 2016 GAAP and operating earnings of $1.02 per share. The difference in GAAP and operating earnings for the quarter was largely driven by the merchant generation sale in which AEP reported a $127 million gain. The story of the first quarter was a mild winter that had an impact of about $0.08 per share and the early sale of the merchant generation that also impacted us in the quarter by another $0.06 per share, but we still made it up \u2013 that negative impact by the great performance from continued strategic investments in our regulated businesses and transmission. A little later, Brian will talk more about load numbers and this being the third warmest winter in over 40 years in our service territory. But suffice it to say, we are pleased with the quarter given these prevailing headwinds. Even though our normalized load was down from first quarter 2016, looking deeper at the fundamentals, there are indications for optimism, particularly in the energy sector in areas such as oil and gas, mining, primary metals and others, which we really haven't seen in quite a while. Additionally, our employees continue to be focused on O&M spending and prioritization to match not only delivering on our shareholders and customer expectations, but positioning this company for the future. So, let's get to some of the areas you may have questions about. I thought I would take a moment and talk about the Ohio legislation. There seems to be some level of confusion about what AEP is trying to achieve with this proposed legislation. This legislation is limited in its scope, and it's incremental through our current investment thesis. First, we are looking for permanent support of the PPA that provides OVEC generation to AEP Ohio customers. The PUCO has previously approved our recovery of these costs, but we need to fortify this through legislation. The second area of focus provides clarity for regulated recovery of the building of new generation by an electric distribution utility, such as AEP Ohio, if the PUCO determines a need. We are actively engaged with a variety of stakeholders and legislators to market participants to deliver \u2013 to develop specific language that can gain broad support. We might see this effort get bifurcated to move OVEC first and then the broader EDU question, but we'll still see both moving this year, perhaps, third quarter and fourth quarter, respectively. What this is not is the total re-regulation of the Ohio generation. That went out the door when we sold generation and took the write-downs last year. This legislation from AEP's perspective is entirely forward-looking that provides investment potential in Ohio generation that would be positive through our current investment plans. How are we doing in transmission? We reported this quarter that net plant invested is up 32% year-on-year with an increase of $0.05 per share, so our transmission investments are doing well. We did receive our FERC 205 case approval to put in place forward-looking transmission rates with an effective date of January 1. If ultimately upheld, this will be positive for further investments in transmission for the benefit of our customers with a more attractive recovery mechanism. We are currently in the process of settlement hearings and discovery on the FERC 205 case. The FERC 206 case is still awaiting rulemaking, so this is still ongoing. But we still believe our rates fall within the reasonableness framework that FERC has shown in reviewing transmission rate structures. As you all know, our investment plans center on infrastructure development focused on our regulated businesses enhanced by our ability to invest in the largest transmission system in the U.S. Also as icing on the cake, we have been additionally focused on renewables, and also contracted renewables. And that business continues to progress well in a very selective and disciplined way. Our competitive renewables business continues to be on track that we described to you last fall with a plan to invest $1 billion in contracted renewables over the next three years. Over the past several months we have explored the opportunity to invest in and own nearly 100 projects, both wind and solar, in AEP Renewables. Our balanced and disciplined approach, taking into account risk and return, has led us to successfully invest in only two of those projects, both solar, one in Utah and one in Nevada, backed by PPAs from credit worthy utilities. To date, we have invested about $145 million in these two projects. In addition, in AEP Onsite Partners, which is our customer solutions business, we successfully invested about $50 million in 18 projects operating in eight different states. We also have a number of projects under construction with an expected cost of another $50 million to be in service in the second quarter. Collectively, between AEP Renewables and AEP Onsite Partners, we are on pace to have about $300 million to $350 million of capital invested this year, about a third of the way of $1 billion, and are excited about the opportunities in the marketplace and our capabilities and discipline in operating and investing in these types of projects. We also want to reiterate that these contracted renewable investments are in addition to our continued pipeline of renewable investments in our regulated utilities. We will continue to adjust and prioritize our overall capital program based upon the ebbs and flows of the various needs of our different lines of business. In regards to the merchant generation, as you know, we completed the sale of the four merchant generation facilities in Ohio early in the first quarter. The proceeds from the transaction have been redeployed in the regulated business and transmission as well as other renewables-related projects. Our progress has been consistent with our message of using a disciplined approach to methodically reducing risk of merchant generation and augmenting investment in earnings from contracted renewables. Regarding the remaining merchant generation assets, AEP Generation Resources continues the strategic transformation of the competitive generation business in Ohio with the recent announcement of our sale of our share of the Zimmer station, 330 megawatts, to Dynegy, while at the same time purchasing Dynegy's share of the Conesville Unit 4 capacity, which is about 312 megawatts. This transaction is awaiting FERC approval to move forward. Further, AEP has given its formal consent to DP&L, Dayton Power & Light, to retire our share of Stuart Units 1 through 4, 603 megawatts, by June 1, 2018. Basically, after these two events, our competitive generation consists of our ownership in the Conesville station, 1,461 megawatts, and Cardinal Unit 1, 595 megawatts. So it really amounts to a little over 2,000 megawatts. We continue to explore our strategic alternatives with these two stations and in the case of Cardinal, continued discussions with Buckeye Power, our partner for the past 50 years in a joint operating agreement, seeking ways to enable a more modern and efficient relationship at the facility, as we explore our strategic alternatives in parallel. We would expect further details to be discussed later this year on these issues. Okay. Now turning to the equalizer graph. Our overall ROE continues to be good at 10.4%. While some jurisdictions are doing very well, there are some that remain challenged. And we'll talk about those. So starting with Ohio power, the ROE for AEP Ohio at the end of the first quarter 2017 was 14.5%. This is a 12-month rolling average, reflecting rate relief associated with our distribution investment program; shared savings attributed to our energy efficiency program; the annual transmission formula rate true-up; and lowering financing cost. So from an Ohio perspective, we continue to do well. Although the 14.5% does include some of the legacy settlement items that would not be included in a SEET review, so we need to be careful with that. APCo, the ROE for APCo at the end of the first quarter 2017 was 9.6%. So this change is driven by lower customer usage. And base rates still remain frozen in Virginia. So they've held in there pretty well from an ROE perspective with the rate freeze in Virginia as well. Kentucky, the ROE for Kentucky Power at the end of the first quarter 2017 was 6.3%. The company plans to address this shortfall with a base rate application to be filed at the end of May with new rates effective beginning in December 2017. So Kentucky we expect to continue to improve. I&M achieved an ROE of 11.3% at the end of the first quarter 2017. I&M continues to benefit from strong regulatory frameworks in place for major capital programs, which we've discussed in previous quarters, across all of its business units and also closely managing expenses. PSO, the ROE for PSO at the end of the first quarter 2017 was 7.5%. The declining ROE is primarily because of regulatory lag and the outcome from the Oklahoma Commission's last rate case order in December 2016. PSO is preparing \u2013 as we mentioned earlier, preparing for its next base rate case filing, which is planned for the end of June of 2017. So we're going back in for additional recovery there to start that process. As far as SWEPCO is concerned, somewhat the same story there. The ROE for SWEPCO at the end of the first quarter 2017 was 7.2%. In April, the Louisiana Public Service Commission unanimously approved an increase to SWEPCO's formula base rate, increasing annual revenues by $36 million with rates to be effective May 1. So, we'll continue to see that come back in. SWEPCO filed in December of 2016 to update its Texas base rate. So, that's one rate case we're watching very closely in Texas. Earlier this year, the company successfully executed transmission and distribution revenue recovery factor filings in Texas for a total of $13.2 million in annualized revenues. So, offsetting these positive outcomes, however, continues to be the portion of Turk \u2013 the Arkansas portion of Turk that's not currently retail rates. So, they'll continue to be a little bit challenged, but we expect it to continue to come up based on these other cases that are being filed. AEP Texas, the ROE for AEP Texas at the end of the first quarter was 10.7%, which was primarily due to increased equity balances which include an equity infusion from AEP Corporation to support a substantial amount of capital expenditures that are occurring there and lower kilowatt hour sales in the first quarter of 2017 that's weather-related. AEP Transmission Holdco, the ROE for AEP Transmission Holdco at the end of the first quarter was 12.6%. The improved ROE is driven by a decrease in regulatory lag compared to prior years, primarily due to the implementation of the fully forward-looking rates in the PJM region. The PJM 205 filing is approved pending hearing or settlement. So, at this point, it's showing very good returns from that perspective. So, that pretty well wraps up the quarter from an ROE perspective at 10.4%. You know we have three jurisdictions there that we're watching very closely, which we normally do, and we'll be taking steps to ensure that the ROEs continue to improve in those jurisdictions. So, with that, with the completion of our merchant generation asset sale in the first quarter 2017 and our positioning as a fully regulated energy company of the future, I'm happy not to be talking about merchant fleets, capacity markets and auctions, and Ohio deregulation as significant overhanging issues. While AEP has been working hard to establish a firm financial foundation and strategic direction for the company, all of these issues continue to cloud the AEP story. The past few years and the issues we've been dealing with reminds me of how I felt at this year's Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony in New York City. The ceremony was outstanding, as usual, much like AEP's performance in recent years, but there was still an overhang for me because, as a Journey fan, Steve Perry spoke, but didn't sing with the band at the ceremony. I can tell you today that we feel at AEP very good about where we stand as a company today with no real overhanging issues to cloud our view of where this company is going. It's as if Steve Perry, in fact, did sing once again with Journey; don't stop believing in AEP. Brian? Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Thank you, Nick, and good morning, everyone. I'll take us through the financial results for the quarter, provide some insight on load and the economy, and finish with a look at our balance sheet and liquidity. Let's begin on slide 6, which shows that operating earnings for the first quarter were $0.96 per share, or $474 million, compared to $1.02 per share, or $501 million, in 2016. This decline can primarily be attributed to less favorable weather this year than last. Let's look at the earnings drivers by segment. Earnings for the Vertically Integrated Utilities segment were $0.45 per share, down $0.12 with the single largest driver being weather, which negatively impacted earnings for this segment by $0.08. While last year's weather was milder than normal, 2017 was even warmer. Other unfavorable drivers for this segment include a higher effective tax rate due to positive adjustments in 2016 that did not repeat this year and lower normalized retail margins primarily due to 2016 being a leap year with an extra day in the quarter. In terms of retail load and the economy, we are beginning to see some positive signs that I will cover in a few minutes. Partially offsetting these items were recovery of incremental investment across multiple jurisdictions and lower O&M. The Transmission & Distribution Utilities segment earned $0.24 per share for the quarter, up $0.02 from last year. In January, we told you about the global regulatory settlement that we had filed in Ohio which allowed us to resolve several issues related to historical cases. We are pleased that the Public Utility (sic) [Utilities] (17:01) Commission of Ohio issued a final order in February approving the settlement, which allows us to focus our attention on capital investment to improve reliability and better serve our customers. Favorable drivers in this segment include rate changes and higher ERCOT transmission revenue. Partially offsetting these favorable items is lower normalized margins due, in part, to the extra day included in last year's results. Our AEP Transmission Holdco segment continues to grow, contributing $0.14 per share for the quarter, an improvement of $0.05 over last year. Net plant less deferred taxes grew by over $1 billion, an increase of 32% since last March. The Generation and Marketing segment produced earnings of $0.14 per share, flat to last year. This segment realized lower earnings as a result of the January sale of the competitive assets as well as the lower trading and marketing margins from exception gains. These decreases were offset by an improvement in the retail business, positive ITC impacts from solar projects going into service and lower overall costs. Corporate and Other was down $0.01 per share from last year due to increased O&M and interest expense. Overall, despite the drag from weather, we experienced a strong quarter. We are working to offset the downward pressure from the mild winter and are confident in reaffirming our full-year guidance range. Now, let's take a look at slide 7 to review the normalized load performance. We have traditionally presented this slide as billed and accrued load. This quarter, we are representing billed-only load, which we believe represents a more accurate view of load trends. For your reference, we have included billed and accrued in the presentation in the appendix over Bette Jo's strong objections. Starting with the lower-right chart, our normalized retail sales declined by eight-tenths of a percent this quarter. Sales were flat in the commercial class, but down in both residential and industrial. Again, last year was a leap year, which is influencing the comparison. In the upper-left chart, normalized residential sales were down 1.7% for the quarter. We saw a slight increase in residential sales in our I&M territory, but it wasn't enough to offset declines elsewhere. Customer counts for the system were up four-tenths of a percent this quarter, which was nearly double the pace we saw in 2016. In the upper-right chart, commercial sales for the quarter matched last year's results. The strongest growth occurred in Oklahoma and Texas where we saw a pickup in oil and gas activity. Finally, in the bottom-left, industrial sales decreased by three-tenths of a percent. While still negative for the quarter, you can see an improving trend in the industrial class over the past 12 months. The primary reason for this is the recovery of energy prices. Let's review the relationship between load and energy prices in more detail on slide 8. The top chart shows the growth in AEP's oil and gas extraction sales. Upstream producers have responded to the higher oil prices during the quarter. Compared to last year, oil and gas extraction sales are up over 16%. The increase in oil prices and drilling activity, especially in Texas, Louisiana and Oklahoma, has helped lead our Western territory out of recession. The bottom chart has a similar layout, but is showing the relationship between our mining load and the price of natural gas. When natural gas prices are low, electricity markets tend to select more gas generation over coal units. Mining production is closely tied to demand from the electric utility sector, so it is not surprising that sales to the mining sector have been declining over the past several years. However, natural gas prices have increased by over 60% in 2017, which is responsible for the improvement in this sector's sales for the quarter. We will continue to closely monitor energy pricing throughout the year, as it clearly impacts our energy-related industries. Turning to slide 9, let's review the status of our regional economies. As you may recall from our last earnings call, most of the energy-producing regions within our service territory experienced recession in 2016, especially in the West. With the recent increase in energy prices and the subsequent pick up in oil and gas activity, our service territory has now come out of recession and is currently in recovery. As shown in the upper-left chart, our Eastern territory grew by 1.6% this quarter, which is only 0.5% behind the estimated growth for the U.S. Our Western territory grew by two-tenths of a percent, which is a notable improvement from 2016. Looking at the top-right chart, the growth in our East Vertically Integrated Utility segment was led by the Indiana, Michigan service territory, which benefited from growth in the automotive sector. Appalachian Power's territory came out of recession this quarter and Kentucky Power is expected to emerge during the second quarter as the mining sector improves. The bottom chart shows that PSO's recession moderated in the first quarter and is expected to emerge from recession this quarter, given the improved energy pricing. Finally, on the bottom right chart, we see that both of our Transmission & Distribution Utilities continue to improve in the first quarter, with growth in Ohio nearly a percent above that in Texas. Ohio's service territory is more diversified than others, with growth coming from many sectors such as professional business services, education and health care, and government. Overall, we are encouraged by the direction of the economies in our service territories. It is consistent with the improvement we had forecast for 2017. Now, let's move on to slide 10 and review the company's capitalization and liquidity. Our debt to total capital ratio improved by 1.9% during the quarter to 54%, bolstered by the retirement of the AGR and AEG debt following the sale of the merchant generation. Our FFO to debt ratio is solidly in the BBB+ and Baa1 range at 19.5%. Our qualified pension funding improved by approximately 2 percentage points to 98%. Plan assets increased during the quarter due to strong returns, while plan liabilities were essentially flat due to relatively stable interest rates. Our OPEB funding improved a percentage point from year-end to 108% with investment gains outpacing plan benefit and expense payments. We have recently completed an asset liability study in our OPEB plans and, given its well-funded status, we are in the process of de-risking the assets by increasing the fixed income allocation. The estimated after-tax O&M expense for both plans in 2017 is expected to be unchanged from last year at about $15 million. Finally, our net liquidity stands at about $2.7 billion. You will remember that in June of last year, we placed \u2013 we put in place two credit facilities : a $3 billion facility that matures in June of 2022 and a $500 million revolver that matures in June of 2018. The larger facility was intended to support all of our activities and the smaller one was designed to support our competitive generation and related commercial activity, which was under strategic review at the time. With the recent sale of much of that competitive business and with the smaller facility going current, the $3 billion revolver is the right size for the businesses we have today. Since we no longer need the smaller revolver, we will terminate it in May. Let's see if we can't wrap this up quickly on slide 11. We are pleased with our first quarter earnings results, which were achieved despite some very mild winter weather. We were able to do this by investing capital to better serve our customers and by focusing on continuous improvement initiatives that allow us to keep O&M expenses essentially flat. As Nick mentioned earlier, with the closing of the competitive generation asset sale in the first quarter, we are successfully executing against the strategic transformation of American Electric Power into the industry's premier regulated energy company. Finally, our performance in the first quarter and the stability of our regulated business model give us the confidence to reaffirm our full year operating earnings guidance of between $3.55 per share to $3.75 per share. With that I will turn the call over to the operator for your questions. Operator : And first go to the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good morning, guys. Hello? Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Hello? Can you hear me? Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah, I can hear you. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Okay. Good morning, Jonathan. How are you? Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Morning. Good. Thank you. Just a quick question on transmission. Can you guys disclose whether you've taken some kind of reserve in the numbers for the section 206 pending case? Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Yes, we have. Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Jonathan, we have. We've just not indicated what that amount is, for obvious reasons. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: No. I didn't. I just was curious if you've taken one. That was \u2013 thank you. And then on the generation business, it just seems to be tracking kind of pretty well relative to the guidance you'd given for the year, which from memory was like $0.09 from ongoing and $0.09 from assets to be sold, but some of those were sold earlier than you expected. Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Right. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: So can you just talk about how we should be thinking about the contribution from that business in the context of full-year guidance and what you've said before? Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Yeah. So we have filled in \u2013 so obviously, we sold the business sooner than we thought. So we had the $0.09 in for the competitive assets that we sold. We sold them early. So we think there's about a $0.06 hit to our full-year for that. But Chuck and his team are working hard to fill that in, to the degree that they can, with what they're able to do in the retail business and wholesale trading and marketing, in addition to what they're able to do in the renewable business. So while it has been a hit, they're working hard to fill that in. And again we don't have \u2013 for the remaining part of that business it's about $0.09 or $0.10 as well, so it's not a big swing one way or the other. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: But you were at $0.14 in the first quarter was kind of more my question, Brian. Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Like how the strong the first quarter was? Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Right. And is that going to \u2013 are we going to see some give back on the rest of the year or at some one quarter or another? Or is this just structurally going to be a higher number? Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: I think for the balance of the year we don't anticipate giving any back, so we've gotten ahead versus where we thought we'd be. But I wouldn't anticipate a big drag one way or the other in that business. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: And so an ongoing earnings power out of this business would still be in that sort of the dime (27:52) type of number? Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: $0.10 to $0.15. Think about it. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And then could I \u2013 just one small thing. It sounded like you've not adjusted in your sales numbers for the leap day. And so therefore, they'd have been slightly less negative. Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Jonathan, and that's where we get a little crosswise, even with ourselves internally. We had adjusted for it in the budget, but when you look at the comparison to the prior year, it's going to show a negative. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: And that also will largely eliminate as we work our way through the year. It's a larger percentage of the quarter. It's a very small percentage of the full year. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: So just to clarify that, obviously it showed a reduction, but because of the leap year, we still looked at it year-on-year. So if you adjust for that, load was pretty flat. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Fine. Okay. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: That's overall. Yeah. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: And I guess while we're on the topic, we've noticed the change in the basis of presenting the sales. And it looked like you chose the presentation that looks a little less negative. But can you give us the sort of explanation of why \u2013 again I may have missed this on the call, but why you think this is more appropriate? Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: So billed, we can measure exactly. When you look at accrued, there's a fairly detailed calculation that gets you to the accrued calculation \u2013 gets you to the accrued number. So when we present billed and accrued, there is fairly more volatility in how we present the numbers than if we just show what we billed. Remember on a year... Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Previous period adjustments and things like that, that's the issue. Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Right. So on a year-over-year basis, these things flatten out. When you look at the incremental periods, there's less volatility in just showing the billed. And we wanted to present both of them, Jonathan, because we want to make sure that we're not hiding anything. And like I said, Bette Jo strongly objected to us showing the billed and accrued in the appendix. That's kind of a joke actually. But we felt that both presentation allows you to figure it out. But we felt that billed-only reflects more accurately the trend. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thank you for that, and I'll let someone else go. Sorry. Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Thanks, Jonathan. Operator : Our next question is from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS. Please go ahead. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Morning, Julien. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Hey, good morning, everyone, appreciate it. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Yes. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : So perhaps just to follow up a little bit on your renewable commentary from the call. Can you elaborate a little bit on what exactly the opportunities are on the regulated side? Perhaps just articulate the eligible regulated jurisdictions. And also just talk about how you see that expanding over time. Maybe what is the opportunity and the cadence of that opportunity in terms of capital and megawatts? Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Yeah. So we have several RFPs that have been out in various jurisdictions. But we also have the 900 megawatts in Ohio that we're moving forward with. And half of that at least will be AEP Ohio. And then the other jurisdictions, we have solar in Virginia, West Virginia, wind RFP in APCo. They're currently negotiating terms on the purchase of a 225-megawatt project. And then SWEPCO has a wind RFP where they'll purchase up to 100 megawatts of capacity that will also be owned. So you have several areas that are now emerging from an operating company perspective, where we're piecemealing in the renewable side of things from a build standpoint. We still have a couple of them that are outstanding from a purchase \u2013 power purchase arrangement. West Virginia and Virginia have a 120-megawatt PPA there, but most of these going in now are more build options. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Got it. And what's the timeline to getting some of these initial bids back and finalized? Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Yeah, so as far as the wind RFP, that's probably toward the tail-end of the year, because it gets filed and then going through that process of negotiation and getting the approvals to get it done. As far as the Ohio PPAs, sort of the same type of schedule on those. We've got to go back to the Commission and get \u2013 we've already done the bidding and we've got to go back to the Commission and start reeling all those in. And by the way, the legislation makes it more prescriptive as far as new generation, but it won't stop us in terms of investing in the renewables in Ohio, in particular. So, Ohio, West Virginia, SWEPCO, those are moving ahead. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Excellent. And then, turning back to the transmission side, obviously, we've gotten a court case. How, if at all, does the latest court case impact any of your 205 or 206 filings? I imagine that might even impact the settlement discussions themselves. I'd just be curious. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Yeah. I think that's probably more long-term, but it really referred back or remanded back to the FERC to really focus on how to come up with the result that they did. So, as we look at it, I don't think it's going to have much impact in the discussions that we have. It could delay a decision, because they may want to get through that process, but we still feel like, as far as 206, it's in that reasonableness framework and FERC still \u2013 at least, the previous FERC. We have new FERC Commissioners coming on, I guess, pretty soon, but their driver will still be on the investment in transmission. And so, we expect them to fortify the results that they came up with and it should be fine. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : But to be clear, the court order doesn't necessarily change your expectation of the (34:49) requirement on the... Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: No. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Great. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: No. It doesn't. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Got it. All right. Excellent. Well, thank you all very much. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Sure thing. Operator : Next, we'll go to Ali Agha with SunTrust. Please go ahead. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thank you. Good morning. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Good morning, Ali. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Good morning. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Good morning. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Good morning. Nick, to the extent that you are successful in tweaking the Ohio legislation that you're looking at, could that potentially lead to incremental CapEx opportunities \u2013 rate-based CapEx opportunities beyond the $17.3 billion that you've laid out over the next three years? Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: It could. As a matter of fact, the 900 megawatts is not included in our present forecast on the renewable \u2013 our financial forecast, so you have that. And what we're really trying to get with that second part of it, which you mentioned, is the ability to go back to the Commission in a very prescriptive manner to get the approval for whatever kind of resources we want to have done. So, those would all be incremental to that effort. And we really believe \u2013 in Ohio, if Ohio wants to take on its own resource portfolio, then there has to be a mechanism for that type of investment and we want to be there to make those investments. So, it would be incremental. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. And then, I guess, Brian, how much headroom do you have \u2013 when you look at that CapEx budget, $17.3 billion, how much headroom do you have that you could potentially increase that without having to go to the equity markets? Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: We have some room in our balance sheet to be able to that, and we continuously look at that as we're trying to measure how much CapEx we put into growth, how much dividend we pay out to our shareholders and what the strength of our balance sheet is. But if we were to get some of those incremental projects, either renewable or transmission, we believe we could fund those without having to access the equity markets. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Good, good. And last question, just to clarify, again, Brian. So, as you mention, the early sale of the merchant portfolio kind of created a bit of a gap in terms of the earnings that you'd budgeted for the year, but given the results through the first quarter, I just want to be clear, are we still trying to fill the gap or is the gap now largely filled? How should I be thinking about that $0.06 gap? Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: So, I think we were looking at about $0.09 from the competitive generation assets and $0.09 or $0.10 from that business \u2013 the go-forward business that we were going to keep; so, all together, about $0.20. We're at about $0.14, now. We still think we'll be in that $0.20 to $0.25 range for the combined businesses for the full-year. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Ali, just to go over one point, though, when \u2013 and I mentioned that our employees have been working really hard to look at O&M and those kinds of issues. When the quarter started out \u2013 the first quarter started out, we knew we were going to close this transaction. I think it was at the end of January, we closed it. So, we were $0.06 short. January and February, as you recall, were very, very warm winters and we knew we were getting behind from that perspective. So, we started the process of going through our organization to determine what we could do from an O&M perspective to bring all of this back into line \u2013 to alignment, and that's what we do. We do that on a regular basis and those plans are there, and we'll continue to manage that through the year. So, when you think about a $0.06 gap or anything like that, just remember, we know there's a $0.06 gap, too, and we're working through that. And our employees are used to this. I mean, it's amazing to me. I think \u2013 from a cultural perspective, over the last five years, we have certainly gotten to the point where our employees are fully engaged in what we're trying to achieve and demonstrate to our shareholders and to our customers. And I'm very proud when we have things like that occur, that we adjust to it, and we'll continue to adjust to it. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Got it. Thank you. Operator : Our next question's from Praful Mehta with Citigroup. Please go ahead. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Good morning. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi. Thanks, guys. The first question was on the remaining generation assets. I know it's a small fleet left now \u2013 or small set of assets left now, but when do you think you have a decision on what you want to do with them in terms of the strategic review? Is that sale process \u2013 if it were to go down the sale process part, do you think that's something that you can get done or at least announce this year? And is part of that the retail business? If you do exit all the generation, do you intend to then hold on to retail or is retail something that you would also look to exit from? Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Well, first of all, on the rest of the competitive business, that strategic process is in place. It's been going on. Negotiations are going on and we expect a result on that before the end of the year. And remember, we've already written those assets down. So, from a financial standpoint we're practically out of it, but nevertheless, we're going through that process to ensure that we wind up with arrangements that we can live with relative to those assets. So, that will continue. As far as the retail is concerned, I know this discussion goes back and forth based upon the exposure relative to retail. From day one of the retail effort, we have been very, very disciplined in our approach. It's relatively small, about 450,000 customers. And we manage and hedge that very well regardless of whether we have generation or don't have generation. Now, it'd be preferable to have generation. Obviously, we're looking at that from a strategic standpoint. But nevertheless, we feel very good about where we sit from that perspective. The other side of it is strategic. I really believe that the retail customers we have, we have a relationship with those customers. And if you look at the future and what it holds relative to our business, that relationship is going to be critical, not only in terms of providing their energy needs, but in terms of the channel growth associated with additional earnings associated with serving those customers. So, at this point, I'd say as long as we can manage it and be very disciplined about it and it provides a strategic hedge for us, particularly if jurisdictions decide to go deregulated or whatever, we have the foundation to make sure we're successful. So, at this point, that's the way we look at retail. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Got you. But if there was an IPP looking to match their generation with retail, are you open to opportunities at this point or the intention is to keep it at this point in terms of the strategic review? Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: No. We're open to those opportunities because, obviously, having generation attached to it in some fashion not only provides a hedge, but also it could provide further benefits in terms of growth to that part of the business. But it has to be done in a very disciplined way. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Got you. And then, just moving to the renewables side, the contracted renewables, then, is the deregulated side. It looks like, off that $1 billion investment, there seems to be good progress this year in terms of the investments in that business. Just wanted to understand from an end-game perspective, once you do have the three-year $1 billion investments and you've completed that cycle, is the intention, then, to kind of continue to re-up and reinvest or allocate capital towards further building out that platform or, at that point, would you go through a strategic review? Just wanted to understand what happens post the three years. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Yeah, I think the way we look at it is, obviously, it's a continuing part of our business, but our business is really about the capital allocation. And it's about the issues that we have ongoing with our lines of businesses. So, if there's additional transmission capability out there, we're going to take advantage of it. If there's additional opportunities from a regulated infrastructure standpoint, we're going to take advantage of it. If there continue to be opportunities with a high threshold that Chuck maintain \u2013 Chuck Zebula maintains for his business, we're going to take advantage of that as well. But it'll all be within the context of ensuring that we get the most stable earnings capability that we can get and, as well, provide that consistency to the market and invest in the right things. That's clearly where we stand. So, it's hard to say what will happen in three years. And if you look at some of the things that we see, there's additional opportunities that we may or may not be able to take advantage of, that we have a pipeline of needs for capacity and for capital. And we're going to take advantage of it in the best way we can. So, it really is all about capital allocation, not about growing a contracted renewable business. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Got you. And then, if tax reform were to actually pass and you did have the tax rate going from like to whatever, 15%, does that impact or would that impact your decision in any way around this business? Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Certainly, the tax effects are a critical part of this business. So, we'll make that determination when we know what the \u2013 any investment tax credits or whatever does relative to that. So, the key component around tax reform, you got to remember, though, and we want to maintain that position, is that we have less debt at the parent and, because we have debt at the operating companies, we have the flexibility to work with our jurisdictions on whatever the result is from a tax reform perspective. So, that in itself is a risk mitigation effort for us. So, we're not going to go longer in terms of risk relative to contracted renewables or anything else. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Got you. Much appreciated. Thank you, guys. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Yes. Operator : Our next question is from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Morning, Steve. Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Hey. Good morning. My question was actually answered. Thank you. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Good. Operator : And we'll go to Paul Patterson, Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Good morning. How are you? Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Morning, Paul. How are you? Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. Just on the \u2013 I know that you guys are very much less in the merchant business. But there are some proposals that PJM is entertaining with respect to state subsidy impacts on the wholesale market. They've got several initiatives. And I'm not asking you go over all of them. But just in general what do you think about the potential of those to potentially coming about? And how they might influence the policies in Ohio? Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Well, I guess the real question is, any proposal out of PJM, is it going to be timely enough for anything? Because it takes so long to get through any kind of process. So when they talk about market reform to adjust for what the states are trying to do because of a lack of ability to cover base load generation in PJM's competitive market, I think it's going to take time for them to do. I mean you put it in a stakeholder process and who knows when it makes it out. And then you go from there. So I guess and maybe my \u2013 our past history of dealing with the organized markets from a merchant standpoint is clouding my judgment. But I wouldn't bet on a lot of major changes there that would be particularly timely, particularly for nuclear and certainly for coal as well. And from a state perspective I support the state stepping up where the organized markets don't cover what needs to be covered to ensure that there is a balanced portfolio. And if FERC doesn't do it, then the states should. And the FERC should let the states do it, because unless you do, really focus on these organized market reforms that enable a balanced portfolio to continue to exist. It's a risk management question, not a literal market, lowest cost type of question. So until that's resolved, I support the states. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. And then \u2013 thanks for that. Then in terms of the solar tax credit amortization that impacted I guess tax rates for the Generation & Marketing. I apologize if I missed this, but what \u2013 could you just elaborate a little bit more on what that is? And how we should see that going forward? Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Yeah. We do the longer realization measurement, rather than realizing it all at once. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. And that's... Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: The one that's much more consistent with the regulated utility model. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. And why did that drive down tax rates this quarter versus last quarter? Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: So we had a solar project where we had the investment tax credit where it's realized contemporaneously, so that's what drove it down. So we had the investment tax credit on a solar project where we realized it in the beginning period. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : In this first quarter? Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Yes. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. And how will that \u2013 and so that just sort of \u2013 that's kind of a one shot in the arm kind of thing? Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Correct. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. Okay. And then just finally, and I apologize for missing this. But you did mention quickly on the call that there was a SEET impact that would change the ROE. That we should be careful in looking at that equalizer chart with respect to the impact on SEET. And I just was wondering, what would the SEET number be? Or roughly speaking, if it was adjusted for that? Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Yeah. We haven't discussed that. All really we can say is that the 14.5%, there are some legacy issues in there. So when a SEET test actually occurs, which I guess was filed second quarter of 2017 for 2016, that that would be excluded. So you look at it on its face value, 14.5% looks pretty robust. But you got to consider that there \u2013 whenever a SEET test is done, issues get excluded, which would bring that ROE down. But we haven't said what that is. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. So the ROE would be lower. Okay. Just wanted to make sure. Okay. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Yeah. Yeah. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Thanks so much. Operator : Our next question is from Anthony Crowdell with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC : Hey, good morning. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Morning, Anthony. Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC : Nick, I wanted to jump on something you maybe \u2013 and I may have misheard it. To Praful's question, when you were talking about the retail business, did you say you would strategically look at merchant generation to add to the retail portfolio if it made sense? Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: No, didn't say that. No, didn't \u2013 no, I think what we're saying \u2013 we're saying is that, if there's opportunities to match generation in some fashion with the retail play, that that wouldn't \u2013 that could make sense. But it doesn't mean we're going to go acquire or buy or have more merchant generation to back it up. That's not the case. Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC : Okay. And my real question was on Ohio. Just I want to understand what's happening in Ohio. You're saying that you're going to try to I guess separate the bill, where you're going to request I guess approval of the OVEC plan first. And then, second, go in for I guess the \u2013 I don't know if it's restructuring, the word restructuring. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Yeah. Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC : Is that the process in \u2013 is it a fair read-through, you think, for investors, if you receive approval for OVEC, that's a good litmus test for the restructuring? Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Yeah. So both are in; both are in right now. There are some legislators who have indicated because OVEC is probably a cleaner issue to drive through pretty quickly, because there's some reasons to get OVEC clarified that sort of \u2013 it's a much easier proposition to get done from a legislative standpoint. The broader question of this ability to invest on behalf of the electric distribution utility is a broader question that brings in probably more issues to be discussed. So, the question is, do you try to do it all together or do you just drive out the easy part first, and then deal with the one that has just the broader issues associated with it. So, that's what I was talking about. So, that's why \u2013 one may get solved \u2013 the OVEC thing may get solved third quarter, and then the other gets solved fourth quarter. And so, that way we can have a dialogue of all the parties and get a more robust solution on the second part of it. (53:41) Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Sorry. Go ahead. Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC : I was just \u2013 my question \u2013 would the OVEC part of the original filing \u2013 and I apologize the year, so like 2014 or something, that was the original filing you made in Ohio? Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Yeah, it was. We wanted more prescriptive language in there that allowed for \u2013 to ensure that OVEC can continue on from here on out till it gets that recovery from the AEP Ohio side because we never \u2013 that PPA has always been with AEP Ohio and stayed with AEP Ohio even with deregulation. So, we want to make sure that it continues to be attached to the AEP Ohio distribution company. Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Yes. Operator : Next, we'll go to Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Good morning, Stephen. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi, good morning. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: How are you doing? Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Most of my questions have been addressed. I just want to follow up on Ali's question on the balance sheet. Brian, the FFO to debt stats look very, very good compared to the target range. Should we assume that there is some ability to move downward within that range? I guess, I'm thinking generally in the middle of that range rather than be at the high end of the range to the extent that you find more investment opportunities? Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: There is, Stephen. Part of what we're trying to balance is \u2013 I joked that a little over a year ago, the U.S. Congress dropped $3.5 billion on our Treasurer's lap and said, hey, can you use this in terms of bonus depreciation. And then, we had proceeds from a sale of about $2.2 billion again this year. And what I think we've shown is an ability to put that excess capital that we found to work in growing our business organically. The benefits of those things start to wane a little bit as we get to the end of the decade and those credit metrics get back in to the middle part of the range, how do I say it, naturally as some of the benefits that we're working through have been reinvested in the business, one, and expire in terms of the tax benefits, two. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: That's great. That's a good point. That's all I had. Thank you. Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Thank you, Stephen. Operator : And we'll go to Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Good morning. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Hey, Paul. How are you? Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: I'm well, thanks. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Good. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: I hate to bring it up, again, but would you keep some of the Ohio generation as a backstop to retail, is that what you were driving at? Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: No. No. What we're saying is if there was a hedging relationship that could be done through contract with a generation provider \u2013 just like we do in our normal hedging practice. Instead of hedge against the market, hedge against some generation. We're open to that. We're not open to owning generation. Been there, done that, not doing it again. So, as far as maintaining generation in Ohio to support the retail effort? No. That's not in the cards, either. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thank you for that clarification. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Yes. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: And then, Lisa's business did pretty well this quarter. Was there anything unusual in this, and then what's the outlook for this for the rest of the year? Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: I think it continues to be robust according to the plan. And certainly, as additional other opportunities arrives, we'll take advantage of it just like we have in the past. And Lisa continues to review her transmission projects and Transource's transmission projects as well, and will continue to do that. So, she \u2013 her business has performed very well, and we continue to see that progressing. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Was there anything \u2013 any large projects or anything came on this quarter or year-over-year that kind of drove that nickel uptick? Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Are you talking about transmission? Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Yes. Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Okay. So, a component of that was the 205 filing being retroactive to January 1. Does that make sense? Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Yes. Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: So, we got an administrative order from FERC that allowed us to go back and put our 205 filing in effect January 1, and that allowed us to pick up $0.04 or $0.05. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Got it. Okay. Thank you very much. Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Thank you. Operator : And we'll go to Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Good morning, Michael. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Good morning, Nick. You guys have done, and many other utilities as well, a lot of work around getting \u2013 improving regulation in some of the states, like Arkansas with the new formula rate legislation, in Louisiana with its formula rate plans. Just curious, how do you think about making similar type of changes in a place like Oklahoma, where not just your company there, PSO, but others deal with significant amounts of regulatory lag, where the rate of recovery versus request tend to come in very different than what you see in a lot of other regions? How do you think about, from either a legislative or a regulatory process, whether to fix that and what are your alternatives if you can't? Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Yeah, so, wherever we can do it, certainly, we'd love to pursue formula base rates in the various jurisdictions because, obviously, it brings more concurrent recovery of invested capital. And you continue to do that. I mean, certainly, you mentioned Arkansas, I think in Indiana, Michigan there's some form of formula rate. So \u2013 there's riders associated with that, a lot of riders, but certainly from a formula-based rate perspective, we'd like to see that progress because these states that have large regulatory lags \u2013 and Oklahoma was a perfect example where you file a case and it takes a long time to get recovery and approval of the rates. And then, there's a haircut associated with it, but still drives the utility at subpar ROEs. I mean, here's, what, 7.6% or whatever it was in Oklahoma with an authorized return that's higher than that and you never catch up. We're having to file another rate case to make the point that, hey, we're not getting the returns from the investments that we're making in this state. So, for those states that have \u2013 I mean, it's fine to have \u2013 if you don't have formula-based rates, at least have a rate case mechanism that's timely and even some forward-looking aspects of it to ensure that we can invest the capital that's needed and required for the benefit of our customers. So, Michael, we're working on that across the board. It's really been in the context of riders, but where we can get it, we're focused on getting these formula-based rates in place. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Do you need legislative change in Oklahoma to improve the regulatory rate-making process or can that be done directly between the utilities and the OCC? Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Yeah. It's a constitutional issue in Oklahoma. So, yeah, we would certainly \u2013 that'd be a lot more support, I guess, than just legislative. But Oklahoma can fix the situation though, by \u2013 actually, in Oklahoma, we have had some pretty progressive riders in place and they've done a decent job of that, but the rate case aspects is just taking too long and getting results that are subpar and you're always behind the eight ball. So, we really need Oklahoma to step up the game a little bit in terms of our ability to make the investments that Oklahoma requires. I mean, Oklahoma is in a situation where they have a massive set of potential around generation to reduce customers' cost, and also these other mechanisms, investments to be made that really benefit. We did the tree trimming cycle in Oklahoma through a rider and it worked great from a outage recovery perspective. So, there's a lot of benefits out there that are being impeded by the progress to get these cases through. So, hopefully we'll make some progress from that perspective. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Thanks, Nick. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Yes.

Please refer to the reconciliation of the applicable GAAP measures provided in the appendix of today's presentation. Joining me this morning for opening remarks are Nick Akins, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Brian Tierney, our Chief Financial Officer. We will take your questions following their remarks. I will now turn the call over to Nick. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Thanks, Bette Jo. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to AEP's second quarter 2017 earnings call. Once again this quarter, AEP released earnings that are on track for the year despite very mild spring weather. In fact, along with first quarter results where winter was also mild, the weather has impacted earnings by about $0.12 per share year-to-date versus normal, but we're still on budget to meet our earnings guidance for the year. As you know, we recognized the mild weather early on in the year and adjusted our O&M spending to compensate for the possibility of mild weather impacts. So again, we actually continue to be on budget with our projection for the midpoint of guidance. So we confirm our existing 2017 operating guidance range of $3.55 to $3.75 per share. We reported GAAP and operating earnings coming in at $0.76 per share and $0.75 per share, respectively, versus second quarter 2016 GAAP and operating earnings of $1.02 per share and $0.95 per share, respectively. For the year-to-date, that brings 2017 year-to-date to GAAP and operating earnings of $1.97 per share and $1.72 per share, respectively, versus 2016 year-to-date of $2.04 per share of GAAP and $1.97 per share of operating earnings. This year, comparing 2017 to 2016 is like comparing apples to oranges. We're a different company centered on regulated operations and investments without significant unregulated operations, as in 2016, and have effectively de-risked the company and really focused on our earnings growth trajectory of 5% to 7% in the future. Nothing has changed for AEP in its view of achieving our 2017 guidance as a foundation for future growth. Since football season is upon us, as Tom Landry, the famous coach of the Dallas Cowboys, once said, confidence comes from knowing what you're doing. If you're prepared for something, you usually do it; if not, you usually fall flat on your face. AEP is confident. We know what we're doing and we are prepared. We're on track, again, for guidance, and the fundamentals, as we will talk about later, are strong. So our headline is guidance confirmed, fundamentals getting stronger despite the weather. Just to reiterate the point regarding mild weather year-to-date for the second quarter, our heating degree days \u2013 and you'll see that in the 10-Q on the registrant. So we're significantly below normal, making the quarter the second mildest in the last 30 years. When taking into account the first quarter as well, 2017 year-to-date has been the mildest year based upon heating degree days in the last 30 years. That being said, from the load perspective, Brian will be getting this in more detail a bit later, but we're pleased with the strong industrial load performance this quarter in almost all sectors that if this trend continues will bode well for commercial and residential pick-ups in the future. Moving through some of the areas of interest this quarter, I'm sure you all saw the announcement yesterday regarding the Wind Catcher Energy Connection project, a proposed and substantial renewables project that would ultimately serve our AEP SWEPCO and PSO customers in Oklahoma, Louisiana, Texas and Arkansas. This project has been almost a year in the making and is in the developmental stages with filings to be made in these four state jurisdictions asking for approval to develop, construct and own 2000 megawatts of high efficiency and capacity factor wind resources along with our approximately 350-mile 765 KV transmission line that serves as a generation interconnect to connect the resources to serve PSO and SWEPCO customers. The estimated cost of the project is approximately $4.5 billion, including AFUDC, and ownership is split between SWEPCO and PSO 70%/30%, respectively. The beauty of this project is severalfold. It benefits \u2013 number one, it benefits customers by approximately $7 billion over the 25-year life, $2.7 billion on a present value basis. Number two, it will boost economic growth in the region where the jobs, taxes, royalties and economic development follow-on effects will be considerable. Three, it provides further diversification of generation resources by using indigenous high quality resources in the region, mitigating fuel and congestion risk for consumers as well. And it also provides AEP investors with the opportunity for earnings growth as a result. This project is not presently in our capital plan because the various commissions need time for review, but this is a great project and I'm happy to see Commissioner Foster Campbell in Louisiana and the Governor Hutchison of Arkansas already make statements of support. Looking at the benefits to all of this project, this project should be a no-brainer. Moving on to other subjects, AEP's operating companies are in the midst of several rate cases; five, if you include the Ohio ESP. I'll cover these in more detail up front before we get to the general discussion with the equalizer graph. At SWEPCO, the Texas base case that was filed December of 2016 concluded its hearings in June. The net revenue request of $69 million with a requested ROE of 10% rate basing of Welsh, Pirkey, Flint Creek and Dolet Hills environmental controls retrofits along with recovery of the remaining Welsh 2 net book balance and an increasing SBP cost are the main drivers there. We expect an order in November with rates retroactively applied from May of 2017. I&M is working on base cases in both Michigan and Indiana. The Michigan case filed in May included a $51.7 million net revenue request, while the Indiana rate case, which was filed yesterday, included a $263 million net revenue request. Both cases requested a 10.6% ROE. Key drivers of these cases are increase in rate base not covered by riders, loss of wholesale customer load, and a request to accelerate depreciation of Rockport. New rates are expected to be effective in March of 2018 for Michigan and July of 2018 for Indiana. AEP Ohio is seeking to extend their ESP, which is currently set to expire in May of 2018, to 2024. Key issues of the case include increasing the cap on the distribution investment rider to account for the longer period of investment, funding for a four-year trim cycle and some grid modernization activities. Settlement discussions are ongoing and appear to be productive. PSO filed a rate base case in June requesting a net revenue increase of $156 million and an ROE of 10%. Major drivers in that case include rate basing of environmental controls installed at Northeastern and Comanche for Environmental Compliance, and the PSO conversion to basically 100% AMI meters. Other items include increased depreciation rates, and also SPP transmission charges as well. We expect rates to be effective in January of 2018 as a result of this case. And regarding Kentucky, Kentucky Power filed a base case in June requesting a revenue increase of $65 million with an ROE of 10.3%. This case is primarily driven by load loss and other increases in rate base, and rates are expected to be effective in January of 2018. So all in all, these five cases amount to over $500 million in revenue increases; so, a substantial year for AEP to progress along the lines of improving the ROEs in these various jurisdictions. Updating on a few other items, in May the rationalization of our competitive generation business in Ohio continued with the sale of our share of the Zimmer Plant 330-megawatts to Dynegy and our corresponding purchase of Dynegy's share of Conesville Unit 4, which is 312 megawatts. This sale and purchase resulted in consolidating the ownership of each unit with its respective operator, enabling better planning and decision making around each unit. Also, consistent with our filing with the court regarding amendment to the NSR Consent Decree, AEP has proposed to retire Units 5 and 6 at Conesville, 800 megawatts in total, no later than the end of 2022. This will ultimately take our Ohio fleet down to just two coal-fired units after the retirement of Stuart Station, 600 megawatts, next year and the acceptance of our proposal to retire Conesville 5 and 6 by the end of 2022. The remaining two units are Conesville Unit 4, which is 650 megawatts, and Cardinal Unit 1, 595 megawatts, for a total of about 1250 megawatts. We continue to explore strategic alternatives for these remaining two units in Ohio. Our competitive renewables business continues to grow at a pace consistent with our messaging to you last fall, where we announced plans to invest $1 billion in contracted renewables over the next three years. As an update, AEP Renewables recently acquired the interest in a 28-megawatt solar project in California which supplies energy to a 20-year PPA with an investment grade utility. Also, AEP OnSite Partners continues to see its opportunities grow with a number of smaller-scale solar projects in construction in the pipeline. Between these two entities, we have committed $360 million in projects so far, and we continue to look for opportunities that are consistent with our disciplined return requirements and tolerance for risk. So regarding the proposed Ohio legislation, moving on to that, in an effort to ensure long-term generation for Ohio customers with reduced pricing volatility and economic development benefits for the state, AEP Ohio has been actively engaged with a variety of stakeholders to introduce legislation that will enable this to occur. The two primary components of our proposed Ohio restructuring legislation include not only the recovery of OVEC per a legislative solution and also clarity on regulated recovery for the building of new generation if the PUCO determines a need. With respect to OVEC, House Bill 239 with a Companion Bill in the Senate calls for the owners of OVEC to receive recovery of OVEC through billing of customers or customer credits when market prices are above cost. The legislation would take the PUCO's actions of approving recovery for AEP, which needs to be reapproved every few years via the ESP, and make it last for the remainder of the life of the plant, so that's through 2030. The bill would provide benefits to all OVEC utility co-owners in the state. So it's obviously something that's supported by the other utilities, and we expect hearings to resume when the legislature returns from summer recess in September followed with a vote in the House and the Senate. The OVEC bill seems to have wide range of support at this point. Once we have an outcome of the OVEC legislation, we expect the legislature to consider a bill to provide clarity on regulated recovery for the building of new generation. This restructuring legislation certainly will have more hurdles to overcome with opposing parties, but AEP believes there are several compelling reasons why this should be considered that would benefit the State of Ohio and our customers. So now, moving over to the equalizer graph, you can see that we have regulated operating ROEs currently averaging about 9.8%, which we typically range \u2013 you'll see it quarter-to-quarter in the 9.8% to 10.2% range; so, centered around that 10%, in general, we continue to maintain that. As you can see, there's \u2013 we've noted that with asterisks, the ones that are in rate cases, and they typically are the ones that are lower from an ROE perspective. So we're doing exactly what was expected of us in terms of ensuring that we are getting the kind of return expectations for the investments that are made in these various jurisdictions. We also are showing AEP Ohio a little bit differently because we wanted to make it absolutely clear that the 13.6% return that's reflected here is all-in that includes legacy items that were involved in the settlement, involved in other activities, like the RSR payments and those kinds of things, that are not included in a SEET analysis. So if you exclude those items, the actual return on equity for AEP Ohio is 12.2% on a SEET basis. So just want to make absolutely clear that, when we look at AEP Ohio, we're looking at two different things there. But the SEET-related activities, which is really germane to what AEP is actually accomplishing, is the 12.2%. The rest is legacy-related items. So looking at each jurisdiction, and as I mentioned, AEP Ohio is obviously moving ahead with filings that have been made relative to grid modernization and other activities with smart cities, which is incredibly important to AEP from a strategic perspective to ensure that we're moving ahead from a technological perspective. APCo \u2013 the ROE at APCo at the end of the second quarter was 8.9%. There's been a onetime recognition last year as a result of the 2015 West Virginia base case, so that's why you see the ROE dropping off. But we'll \u2013 and also, the weather has been a significant impact from a ROE perspective for the quarter as well to APCo. Base rates, as you know, are still frozen in Virginia as a result of the February 15 rate freeze law. And as far as Kentucky is concerned, I talked about the Kentucky case. We obviously have filed. That's an important case in front of the Commission. I know it's a challenging case, given the loss of load there, and that's an issue for us. And I think there's a two-pronged approach there; one in relation to the rate-making aspects. The other is related to the economic development in the territory, and I can't say enough about the work that Matt Satterwhite's doing out there in terms of the president out in Kentucky. We have recently had announcement of the large aluminum company that's agreed to locate in the service territory bringing 500 permanent jobs and 1,000 construction jobs. And it really is centered on the aerospace technology area, so hopefully that'll be a seed type of opportunity for other businesses to locate there. So we're working very heavily on a two-pronged approach there; obviously, have to meet the rate-making aspects of it, but secondly, we are working really hard on the economic development side of things to improve the denominator associated with the rate-making activity. From an I&M perspective, we achieved an ROE of 9.3%, mainly impacted by weather and formula rate true-ups. I&M filed, as you know, the rate cases in both Michigan and Indiana. PSO at the end of the quarter was 6.7%. The low \u2013 that low ROE is primarily because of the regulatory lag in the outcome of the last Oklahoma Commission rate case there. And this rate case that's been filed, now, is particularly important because \u2013 particularly in light of the investment \u2013 the proposed investment related to the wind project. We have to see a positive indication in relation to the ability to invest in Oklahoma. And this current case is extremely important in demonstrating our ability to invest in that state. So we're looking for a good outcome out of this particular rate case. SWEPCO \u2013 the ROE for SWEPCO at the end of 2017 was 6.3%, and certainly SWEPCO is working on full cost recovery associated with the environmental equipment that I mentioned earlier. And of course, in April, the LPSC \u2013 the Louisiana Public Service Commission unanimously approved an increase to the formula-based rates, increasing annual revenues by $36 million, which those rates were effective May 1st. So SWEPCO continues to make progress from that perspective, but you still have the \u2013 and will continue for the time being, having the overhang of the Turk plant, the 88 megawatts of Turk that still is hanging out there. So we'll continue to see that. And it definitely impacts the ROE by \u2013 overall ROE by about 1.3%. AEP Texas \u2013 the ROE for AEP Texas at the end of the second quarter 2017 was 10.2%, and the lower ROE is primarily due to increased capital expenditures and slightly lower than expected revenues. As far as the Transco is concerned, it continues to plug along; second quarter at 13.2%. The improved ROE is driven by decrease in regulatory lag compared to prior years, primarily due to the implementation of fully forward-looking rates in the PJM region as a result of the 205 case. So we continue to make progress. It shows the diversity of the AEP system. Some are going to be high; some are going to be low. Actually, none are high, if I \u2013 make sure \u2013 make that point. But certainly, for those that are lower from an ROE perspective, we continue to work on those and we're making the steps that you would expect us to make. So with that, I'll conclude. As you can see, we're in the midst of some substantial rate activity in our state jurisdictions this year and continue our strong growth in the transmission business. But we also continue to make considerable progress on our mission to be the premier regulated energy company of the future. With a culture that supports innovation, financial and operational discipline and execution, and our focus on the future, Wind Catcher, Smart Cities Columbus, BOLD Transmission being perfect examples, this company is heading in a different, but right, direction. As many of you know, I play the drums in a band that is appropriately named The Power Chords. One of our favorite songs we haven't played, yet, is Hitch a Ride by Boston. The lyrics talk about leaving the steely cold city and hitching a ride to the other side, of sailing away, sunshine and freedom. Interesting; wind, sun and freedom to make the right decisions with a firm foundation. That's why AEP is different today, and we remain undaunted in our mission. Brian? Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Thank you, Nick, and good morning, everyone. I'll take us through the second quarter and year-to-date financial results, provide some insight on load and the economy, and finish with a review of our balance sheet and liquidity. Let's begin on slide 6, which shows that operating earnings for the second quarter were $0.75 per share, or $370 million, compared to $0.95 per share, or $466 million in 2016. This difference can primarily be attributed to the sale of the competitive generating assets and positive items that occurred last year that were not repeated this year. Let's look at our earning drivers by segment. Earnings for Vertically Integrated Utilities were $0.25 per share, down $0.18. Favorable prior-year items contribute to this difference, including formula rate true-ups, a June 2016 recognition of deferred billing in West Virginia and a 2016 positive tax adjustment. Other rate relief was favorable due to the recovery of incremental investments across multiple jurisdictions. Weather was milder than last year, as Nick said, and our normalized retail margins were slightly lower. Other unfavorable items in this segment include higher O&M due to transmission services and forestry expenses, higher depreciation and lower AFUDC. The Transmission and Distribution Utilities segment earned $0.23 per share for the quarter, down $0.02 from last year. Unfavorable drivers in this segment include the reversal of a regulatory provision in 2016, lower normalized retail margins, higher O&M due to increased transmission services, higher depreciation and a higher effective income tax rate due to positive 2016 adjustments. Partially offsetting these unfavorable items are recovery of incremental investment to serve our customers and higher ERCOT transmission revenue. Our AEP Transmission Holdco segment continues to grow, contributing $0.26 per share for the quarter, an improvement of $0.07 over last year. The growth in earnings includes the implementation of the FERC 205 forecasted transmission rates. This segment also recorded formula rate true-ups for the second quarter, which are similar to last year's number. In future years, the true-up should remain minimal due to the implementation of forecasted rates. We experienced a slight decline in our joint venture earnings due to an ETT settlement earlier this year. The growth in earnings over last year also reflects our return on incremental investment. Net plant less deferred taxes grew by $1.1 billion, an increase of 32% since last year. The Generation and Marketing segment produced earnings of $0.04 per share, down $0.05 from last year. This segment realized lower earnings due to the sale of the competitive generating assets. Partially offsetting this negative impact were lower depreciation on the remaining assets, better wind conditions and lower overall costs. Corporate and Other was down $0.02 per share from last year due to increased O&M and interest expense. Let's turn to slide 7 and review our year-to-date results. Operating earnings through June were $1.72 per share, or $845 million, compared to $1.97 per share, or $967 million dollars in 2016. This difference can primarily be attributed to unfavorable weather, the sale of competitive generating assets and positive items that occurred last year. Offsetting these effects were transmission earnings and recovery of incremental investment to serve our customers. Let's look at these earnings drivers by segment. Earnings for Vertically Integrated Utilities were $0.69 per share, down $0.30 with the single largest driver being weather, which negatively impacted earnings by $0.11. Partially offsetting the unfavorable drivers is the increased recovery of incremental investment across multiple jurisdictions. The box on the chart lists other smaller impacts for the segment. Through June, the Transmission and Distribution Utilities segment earned $0.47 per share, the same as in 2016. Favorable drivers in this segment include rate changes, higher ERCOT transmission revenue and weather. These were partially offset by several items, including lower normalized load, the reversal of a regulatory provision in 2016, and higher O&M, depreciation and effective income tax rates. AEP Transmission Holdco segment earnings through June were $0.41 per share, up $0.13 over last year. The growth in earnings includes the implementation of the FERC 205 forecasted transmission rates, the impact of the annual true-up for formula rates, and a return on incremental investment. The Generation and Marketing segment produced earnings of $0.18 per share, down $0.06 from last year. This segment realized lower earnings from the sale of the competitive generation assets as well as lower trading and marketing margins. These decreases were offset by lower depreciation on the remaining generating assets and improvement in the retail business, positive impacts from solar projects going into service and lower overall costs. Finally, Corporate and Other was down $0.02 per share from last year due to increased O&M. For the year-to-date period, certain unfavorable comparisons to 2016 were anticipated, like the sale of the competitive generating assets. The milder weather was not anticipated, but is a reality that we are addressing. In response to these issues, we will manage to lower O&M expenses for the second half of 2017 compared to 2016. With that in mind, we are confident in reaffirming our operating earnings guidance for the year. Now, let's take a look at slide 8 to review normalized load performance. Starting with the lower right chart, our normalized retail sales increased by 0.7% this quarter and are now essentially flat for the year. For both the quarter and the year-to-date, the growth in industrial sector is being offset by declining residential and commercial sales. Moving clockwise on the slide, industrial sales increased by 4% this quarter, bringing year-to-date growth in line with expectations for the year at 1.8%. Industrial sales trends have improved since the second quarter of last year when the impact of low energy prices was the most severe. We are now seeing strong industrial results across most of our operating companies and industry. We are optimistic that growth in industrial sales is predictive of better performance for our residential and commercial classes. In the upper left chart, normalized residential sales were down 1.5% for the quarter and down 1.6% year-to-date. Residential customer counts were up 0.4% this quarter, which is nearly double the pace we saw in 2016. Finally, in the upper right chart, commercial sales for the quarter decreased by 0.7%, bringing the year-to-date normalized growth to negative 0.4%. Commercial sales were down across our system with the most pronounced drop in Appalachian Power and Kentucky Power. Since residential and commercial sales tend to lag industrial growth in a business cycle, we anticipate improvement in these classes in the coming quarters. Turning to slide 9, let's take a deeper look at some of the indicators that help explain our stronger industrial load performance for the quarter. The top chart shows the relationship between AEP's oil and gas extraction sales and oil prices. In 2017, oil prices have hovered around the $50 per barrel range during the first two quarters, which has been enough to attract more upstream drilling activity within our service territory. Compared to last year, oil and gas extraction sales are up 3.2% for the quarter, which is the strongest growth since 2015. The increase in drilling activity is largely focused in Oklahoma. The bottom chart is showing the relationship between our mining load and the price of natural gas. Mining production is closely tied to demand from the electric utility sector. When natural gas prices are low, electricity markets tend to select more gas generation over coal units. In addition, we have experienced increased mining for metallurgical coals in the Appalachian Basin. Higher commodity prices in 2017 are responsible for the improvement in this sector's sales for the quarter, which are positive for the first time in years. We will continue to monitor energy prices throughout the year as it clearly impacts our energy related industries. Now, let's review the status of our regional economies on slide 10. As you know from previous calls, most of the energy producing economies within our service territory experienced recession in 2016, especially in the West. With higher energy prices and the subsequent pick-up in oil and gas activity in 2017, our service territory has now come out of recession and is in recovery. As shown in the upper left chart, our Eastern Territory grew by 3.2% this quarter, which was 0.7% faster than the U.S. estimate. Our Western Territory grew by 0.5%, which is a notable improvement from previous quarters. Looking at the growth at our East Vertically Integrated Utilities in the upper right chart, it is noteworthy that Kentucky Power eclipsed Indiana/Michigan in terms of GDP growth. As you know, Kentucky Power's territory has a higher concentration of coal mining, which improved for the first time in years. Indiana/Michigan, on the other hand, has a higher exposure to the automotive industry, which had a record-setting year in 2016, but has moderated since. Appalachian Power's territory came out of recession last quarter and is expected to improve throughout the year. The bottom-left chart shows our West Vertically Integrated Utilities. SWEPCO's service territory came out of recession last quarter and saw 1.1% growth in GDP compared to last year. PSO, on the other hand, is still technically in recession and isn't expected to emerge until later this year. Finally, in the bottom-right chart, you see that both of our Transmission and Distribution Utilities continue to improve in the second quarter with the growth in Ohio nearly 3% above that in Texas. Ohio service territory is more diversified with growth coming from many sectors, such as manufacturing, construction and education and health services. Overall, we are encouraged by the economic trends of our operating companies. They are consistent with the improvement we projected in our guidance for 2017. Now, let's move to slide 11 and review the company's capitalization and liquidity. Our debt to total capital ratio increased 0.5% during the quarter to 54.5%. Our FFO to debt ratio is solidly in the BBB+ and Baa1 range at 18.1%. In June, Moody's upgraded Ohio Power's rating two notches from Baa1 to A2 and cited the strong financial metrics and a supportive regulatory environment as reasons for the upgrade. In addition, Moody's revised the outlook for AEP from stable to positive, recognizing strong financial performance of Ohio Power, I&M and the Transcos, as well as AEP's overall strategy of focusing on growth in our wires business. Our qualified pension funding improved approximately one percentage point to 99%. Plan assets increased due to strong returns and a company contribution of $94 million dollars during the quarter. Plan liabilities were essentially flat due to relatively stable interest rates. Our OPEB funding improved two percentage points during the quarter to 110% with investment gains outpacing plan benefit payments and expenses. The estimated after-tax O&M expense for both plans for 2017 is expected to be unchanged from last year at about $15 million. Finally, our net liquidity stands at about $1.85 billion supported by our $3 billion revolving credit facility. As discussed last quarter, we terminated the $500 million facility in May. Let's turn to slide 12 and try and wrap this up. While quarterly and year-to-date earnings were below last year's results, with the exception of weather, these results were anticipated due to the sale of our competitive generating assets and certain 2016 events that did not repeat this year. Our financial results are in line with the internal forecasts that support our annual guidance. We expect O&M expense for the second half of 2017 to be favorable compared to 2016 by $0.16 per share. We expect these reductions to be evenly spread amongst the Vertically Integrated Utilities and Transmission and Distribution Utilities segments. Accordingly, we're reaffirming our 2017 operating earnings guidance range of $3.55 to $3.75 per share and expect to deliver results, as Nick said earlier, in the middle of that guidance range. With that, I will turn the call over to the operator for your questions. Operator : Thank you. Our first question is from the line of Greg Gordon from Evercore. Please go ahead. Unknown Speaker : Hi, everyone. It's actually Kevin (33:42) here. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Hey, Kevin. Unknown Speaker : If I'm just looking at your capital floor cash through 2019, it's about $5.6 billion a year and a 7.7% CAGR. Based on the current line of sight if you don't consider the wind project, would you expect a material drop off in core capital needs after 2019? Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: No. Unknown Speaker : Okay. So then, the $4.5 billion, I think, is 35% wires and 65% for the wind assets? Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: That's right. Unknown Speaker : The wind assets should be turnkey, so it wouldn't really impact EPS until probably 2021. What about the 35%? Would we see traditional rate making, like AFUDC, in 2020 or 2019? Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Yeah, that's right. That's right. It'd be traditional rate making on that. Unknown Speaker : Okay. That's all I have. Thanks guys. Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Yes. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Jonathan Arnold from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good morning, guys. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Good morning. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Just picking it up, also on the wind, the new investment, any thoughts, preliminary, Nick, on how you might finance this and how much room you have to put (35:02) leverage in the mix? Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Yeah. So, obviously, we want to get to a point of getting Commission approvals, because I think this is a huge project. It's a great project. If you look at it company-by-company, it's not that huge. But when you look at the companies involved, the areas involved, we need to go through with the regulators and make sure they understand and see the benefits; and, some already have, but the benefits that we see in this project. Once we get to that point, then we'll be in a much better position to talk about financing and capital required and whether we issue equity. We've talked in the past about it. When you have a large project that really made sense and that we could focus the investment on that as opposed to the general confers of the corporation, then we believe investors should like that. So if we go down the road, we'll figure out what the appropriate mix is. And obviously, you know, we continue to look at capital, look at our credit metrics. I want to make sure we \u2013 that we remain a very firm foundation for investment. So Brian, I don't know if you have anything add to it. Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: I don't. We've always been thoughtful about how we finance our capital projects. As this progresses and we hear from the regulators, their interest in it, we'll look to put together a firm plan to make sure that we do it is as wisely as possible, as we do our regular capital program. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: There are just not many projects you'll run into \u2013 and you know, really, the sense of urgency around getting approvals for this thing is centered on the federal government's basically given a 62%, 63% off sale and \u2013 with the PTCs; and, to take full advantage of the PTCs, that's $2.5 billion alone. So obviously, we want to get this thing through. And when you get \u2013 take all that into account just to apply investment and that kind of capital and reduce customer bills as a result and produce actually a more \u2013 certainly, a more resilient system as a result, I think is a great thing. So \u2013 but we'll have to figure it out when we get there. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Nick, can you give any insight into the calculation of the $7 billion customer benefit, like do you \u2013 are you assuming a carbon price? With what sort of level, and just is there anything else to kind of help us kind of get to that number? Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Yes. So you know, we've obviously assumed a natural gas price going forward, because, obviously, this is a important hedge against fuel cost. And when you look at \u2013 we did (37:59-38:10) differentials. Obviously, we looked at carbon, and we looked at the value of the production tax credit. So those three components certainly provided the center of the analysis. And we've looked at mid-range cases. We've looked at low cases in terms of natural gas pricing and that kind of thing, and it still stands up. I mean, when you look at the \u2013 certainly, the immediate benefits and the real benefits of the PTCs along with what could happen with carbon, what could happen with natural gas prices, it just looks like a great project. So... Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: The $7 billion number, the $2.7 billion NPV, is that kind of the mid scenario, or where does that fit within the range of scenarios you looked at? Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Yes, that's the mid case scenario, which was still a reasonably low natural gas price comparison. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And then, could I just \u2013 finally, on the transmission piece, obviously, you said normal rate making, but what's the \u2013 would that also be predominantly spending that would fall kind of in the back half of \u2013 very end of your plan into the sort of beyond 2019 period? Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Absolutely. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Yes. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. So we should think about this as more how we sustain 5% to 7% rather than incremental to or... Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: That's a good question. You know, obviously, our indigenous utility growth is centered on 5% to 7%. I think it should make the 5% to 7% more robust. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Chris Turnure from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Hi, Chris. How are you doing? Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Good morning, guys. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Good morning. Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Just to follow up yet again on the wind project, I don't think you talked about recovery for the actual generation portion of it. If you take ownership at a specific kind of date when it becomes commercial, I guess you could time it with a general rate case, certainly, but would you also pursue a rider on top of that just to have a measure of a safe cushion there? Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Yeah, we will. And then, you know, it's part of the normal rate making process, but we would obviously be filing for whatever CCN approvals and we got \u2013 there's an exception to the MBM rule, the Market Based Mechanism, in Louisiana that, I guess, a hearing just yesterday or the day before approved an exception for that. So you're going through the right steps to get to the point where the Commissions become comfortable with the investment, and then we'll go through the normal rate making process for both the generation and the transmission. Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And then, I think one of your peers had gotten some support from committing to local procurement of equipment with a project in Colorado. Are there any other kind of offerings that you're making to politicians and the Commissions down the road that would help kind of garner support here? Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Yes, certainly. I mean, obviously, you don't do a project like this without looking at the socio-economic benefits in the region and for the customers. So \u2013 and even Governor Hutchison this morning mentioned it's good for jobs in Arkansas as well, but substantial \u2013 certainly, there's substantial procurement in all four of the states involved. Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And then, switching gears to rate making, the PSO filing that you just made had a pretty big ask and you just got a conclusion of a rate case with new rates effective early this year in that jurisdiction. I (42:22) 9.5% authorized ROE. Could you just remind us of some of the challenges that you faced in getting that rate case across the finish line, if any? Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: So with the previous rate case in Oklahoma, obviously, we were disappointed with that outcome; and, it was a somewhat challenging time in many respects. And when you \u2013 when we look at the present case, our message has clearly been that this is a very important rate case for Oklahoma, because Oklahoma was doing just fine from a jurisdictional perspective up until a couple of years ago, and then the last rate case was really deficient in terms of its outcome because not only was the timeframe long to get it resolved, but also the outcome is, in effect, chasing expenses that are being made on behalf of customers. So we've got to get that back on the right track, and that's why this case is so important. Not only will it send a signal that we can invest the way we feel like we should in Oklahoma, and can in Oklahoma, but also have an impact on projects like we just discussed, because you really have to think about investments in jurisdictions that are chronically short. Oklahoma has not been that, and I think we're viewing sort of a perturbation that we can recover from. And I truly believe that Oklahoma and Stuart Solomon down at PSO, which is our President down at PSO, is working very hard to get that message across to everyone involved that in order to have a successful Oklahoma from an energy standpoint, PSO has to be part of that picture. And certainly, we're focused on making sure we get a good outcome. Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Can you just remind us of the test year in that case and any kind of true-ups throughout the process? Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Yeah. Do you have the test year...? Let's see. Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Chris, we can have Bette Jo get you that detail Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Yeah. Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Great. Thanks, guys. Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Anthony Crowdell from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC : Hey, good morning. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Hey, Anthony. Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC : Just to stay on the wind and follow up on Jonathan's question, so this is wind that would be in rate base and this is wind that you had said is kind of, you used the word, more robust incremental to 5% to 7% utility growth? Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Certainly, we still maintain our 5% to 7% earnings growth trajectory and, really, we'll have to see how this project gets resolved in combination with all the other projects that we're doing to see what it does to be ultimate growth rate going forward. So in and of itself, the project is incremental, but obviously, we need to \u2013 before we start talking about changes in growth rates, we need to make absolutely sure what project we have, and also how it plays in concert with all the other capital programs we have in place. Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC : Would more generation in a region put even more stress on the unregulated portion of the Turk plant? Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: So you have the 88 megawatts of Turk sitting out there, but when we did the analysis, you know, we showed that even though you're taking some 9 million megawatt hours of wind power and energy coming in, you still need the capacity across the board. And in fact, when we looked at the capacity factors of the other generation, you only saw a very small 1% to 3% drop off in terms of capacity factor on coal. And certainly, even with natural gas, it wasn't that large of a drop off. So this is really playing against, you know, the forward view of fitting in a slice of energy to the benefit of consumers, but still using the capacity out there that's available. So it could put more pressure on the unregulated part of Turk, but Turk is a very efficient unit not \u2013 I don't think it's going to be \u2013 I mean, any difference is probably going to be negligible at best. Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC : Okay. And just switching gears, Ohio, you had said that I \u2013 I don't know if it's \u2013 you used the word settlement discussions are going on or potential for settlement with the extension of the ESP. Do you think there's issues with \u2013 you have \u2013 in the legislature, you have, is it HB 247, I think to end ESPs or to change the way utilities file rate case in Ohio? At the same time, at the PUC you're trying to extend the settlement of an ESP. You think that may cause any \u2013 may prohibit you from reaching a settlement there? Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: No, I don't think that legislation is going to go very far. Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Yeah. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Leslie Rich from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Hey, Leslie. Leslie Best Rich - JPMorgan Investment Management, Inc.: Hi, how are you? Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Fine. Leslie Best Rich - JPMorgan Investment Management, Inc.: Just for a little clarification, I'm sorry if it's sort of already been covered, but you would file for approval shortly for the wind projects? And then, you would plan to commence construction, if approved, in 2018 at some point? Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: That's right. Leslie Best Rich - JPMorgan Investment Management, Inc.: Mid 2018? Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Yeah, and we'd be looking for an outcome on those regulatory cases by April of next year. So we don't have much time to waste on that one. It really is \u2013 it's really driven by making sure we can take full advantage of the PTCs. That's the driver. And for the Commissions that take a look at this, you know, it is a fairly unique situation in that, yes, it's great generation resources. Yes, it provides considerable benefits to customers, but the timing of it needs to match up so that we can be successful in terms of putting it in place and taking advantage of those PTCs. Leslie Best Rich - JPMorgan Investment Management, Inc.: So you've already safe-harbored the equipment, or I guess the developer has done that? Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Yes. Yes, we have. Leslie Best Rich - JPMorgan Investment Management, Inc.: And I guess, why does the region need 2,000 megawatts of generation? I mean, are you shutting other plants? Are you \u2013 you know, is demand growing? You said capacity factors on (49:48) gas plants won't decline that much. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Yeah, Leslie, and really \u2013 and this is probably the most important point to be made in the regulatory filings, and I'm glad you asked that question. This is really \u2013 any wind power project is an energy play, not a capacity play. So from an energy perspective, you're going to get 9 million megawatt hours out of it coming into the system, but at the same time you're only going to get, I think, an SBP that's only like 7%. I may be off by a percent or two, but only 7% counts as capacity. So you still need the other units to provide capacity, and they fill in from an energy perspective as well. So we just have to keep in mind, this project, the difference in capacity and energy. We're not shutting any other units down. Those units are absolutely needed. But what it does do is provide more diversity from a resource perspective, low energy \u2013 very low energy pricing coming in to the sector, which means economic growth. And then, when you think about the transmission side of things, yes, it's a 765, 360-some-odd mile generation interconnect, but usually with large transmission you get large economic development. So I see this as just an extremely important project not just from a energy consumption standpoint, but from an economic development standpoint as well. Leslie Best Rich - JPMorgan Investment Management, Inc.: So the benefits to customers are from lower fuel costs? Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Absolutely. You know, you're basically \u2013 it's a hedge and it's an arbitrage against, primarily, fossil fuel generation resources. And so, if you're able to take the energy and continue with the capacity as used and useful, it's another powerful combination just like we used to do coal pricing versus natural gas pricing. Now you have coal pricing, natural gas pricing and, certainly, the intermittent resources provided from a wind power perspective. So just adds another part of the portfolio. Leslie Best Rich - JPMorgan Investment Management, Inc.: So do you anticipate that when you make these filings that it would result in rate increases to customers? Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: No. No, it won't. Actually, that's the amazing part of it. You're investing a large part of the capital, but keep in mind the government's paying you \u2013 the federal government's paying you for a substantial part of this capital. And then, it's being used \u2013 from an energy perspective, you look at the overall cost to consumers, the cost of the capital being deployed through rate base, and then the attendant energy reductions through fuel, it's a benefit to customers. And that's where we come up with the $7 billion over the 25-year period. I mean, it's substantial. Leslie Best Rich - JPMorgan Investment Management, Inc.: Great. Thank you. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Yes. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Steve Fleishman from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Morning, Steve. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Thank you. Good morning, Nick. So just on that same topic, is it \u2013 will it be clear in there, kind of in like the first year or two, that there's net reductions like in year one to customers from this, so that....? Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Oh, yeah. It's not like it's back-end loaded or anything. These \u2013 in year one, you're seeing benefits to consumers. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. And then, I guess more importantly, just for the approval process in the different states, can you just talk to a little bit of \u2013 I know states have different rules and laws on how they approve projects like this. Xcel, I know, has kind of gone through different processes... Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Yeah, yeah. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : ...doing something similar. So could you just \u2013 like, is it \u2013 did any \u2013 can all these approvals be done through just the regulatory process? Do any states need legislative changes or some kind of different way of doing regulation? Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: No. Steve, there's no legislative changes. It's all done through the regulatory process. But just keep in mind, and this goes back to the investment \u2013 you know, whether it's in our capital plan or not. States deal with it in different fashions. I mean \u2013 and if we're talking April, we're going to have to sit down at the end of that April time period and figure out, okay, what are the risks to our shareholders of moving forward with this particular project given the \u2013 not only the regulatory outcomes, but also the other risk components that are involved with this as well. And we believe, certainly from a risk standpoint, from an operational and construction standpoint, if we can't put generators on top of poles and build transmission lines that we always build all the time, you know, we shouldn't be in this business. So it's not like building a central station generation facility. So you don't have the same level of risk from that perspective, but the risk part of it \u2013 part of the evaluation will be as well \u2013 be what kind of indications we're getting from the various jurisdictions because, some of them, you may get outright approval, some of you may get CCN approvals or CECPN approvals in Arkansas. And what is that going to mean? What is it going to mean in terms of risk? So we have another milestone. We continue to spend money on development of this project, because we feel like it's that important. But in the April timeframe, we will be sitting down with our board to talk about, okay, what have we learned? What are the options available to us and what are the risks being taken, and make a decision to continue on. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. Great. And then, just on going back to the Ohio ESP talk, you said you're having discussions and \u2013 I can't remember your comment, but I think it sounded optimistic. So can you just give a little more color on how you feel on the ESP extension? Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Yeah. So you know these discussions have been going on for quite a while with multiple parties, and some of the issues are new and challenging issues. You know, when you think about Smart Cities and the technology deployment and everybody thinks they ought to have part of the game, and we think, you know, universal access was important and we should be the primary driver of ensuring that that access is providing to all consumers, including underdeveloped, but also others as well so. So it's challenging issues, and things you have to go back and forth with the different parties on. And we've been \u2013 I can say we've been fairly successful in conversations with several of the parties. And there's still a few issues that are still outstanding, but we feel like progress is being made. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. Thank you. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Yes. Bette Jo Rozsa - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Operator, we have time for one more question. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Gregg Orrill from Barclays. Please go ahead. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Hey, Gregg. Gregg Orrill - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey, thank you. So with regard to the Wind Catcher project, would you consider sell-downs as a way to finance it? Is that something you're exploring? Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Gregg, we've already been approached by people who are interested in co-investing with us. Right now, our interest is having this be part of our regulated portfolio and we don't see a need for that at this time. Gregg Orrill - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Good luck. Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Thank you. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Funny how fast word gets around. Bette Jo Rozsa - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Okay, well, thank you for joining us on today's call. As always, the IR team will be available to answer any additional questions you may have. Lois, would you please give the replay information. Operator : Thank you. And, ladies and gentlemen, this conference will be made available for replay after 11 :15 today through August 5th. You may access the AT&T Executive replay system at any time by dialing 1-800-475-6701 and entering the access code 426838. International participants can dial 320-365-3844.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we'll conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. At this time, I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Ms. Bette Jo Rozsa. Please go ahead. Bette Jo Rozsa - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Thank you, Rich. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the third quarter 2017 earnings call for American Electric Power. Thank you for taking the time to join us today. Our earnings release, presentation slides and related financial information are available on our website at aep.com. Today, we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors. Our presentation also includes references to non-GAAP financial information. Please refer to the reconciliation of the applicable GAAP measures provided in the Appendix of today's presentation. Joining me this morning for opening remarks are Nick Akins, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Tierney, our Chief Financial Officer. We will take your questions following their remarks. I will now turn the call over to Nick. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Thanks, Bette Jo. Good morning, everyone, and welcome once again to AEP's third quarter 2017 earnings call. I know you all have probably seen the earnings release this morning. I just want to say from the outset, while primarily the weather has forced us to lower the midpoint of guidance for 2017 slightly, a deeper look at 2017 shows there is much to be positive about. This is exactly why we continue to reaffirm our 2018 guidance range of $3.75 to $3.95 per share with a $3.85 midpoint still built around 5% to 7% growth from a 2017 $3.65 per share midpoint base. Additionally, our board recently approved a $0.03 per share dividend increase or 5.1% further, exhibiting the confidence in our ongoing business plan. So, let me accentuate the positives here so that you can see what I see about this company and its prospects. First, despite having the mildest weather in the last 25 years that affected our normalized load forecast by $0.16 per share, we adjusted our midpoint of the 2017 guidance by only $0.03 per share, which is about the same as normalized weather was off of the third quarter. I remember watching Game of Thrones over the summer thinking that Khaleesi's dragons need some heat \u2013 to bring some heat to heat the place up, but that never happened. Now, don't go add $0.13 per share to your models for next year but recognize that our employees can do what they can do to adjust in real-time when necessary as headwinds persist. We will make up lost ground by driving efficiency, eliminating expenses where practical and with negligible movement of expenses to 2018. Additionally, we are seeing continued improvement in economy, which Brian will talk about later that gives us further confidence of a rebound in the future of all sections of our load. That means the robustness of 2018 and beyond is still intact, and 2017, while challenging, has been remarkably preserved in large part. So, looking at the numbers for the quarter, AEP reported third quarter 2017 GAAP and operating or non-GAAP earnings, we call it now, of $1.11 per share and $1.10 per share, respectively, versus third quarter 2016 GAAP and operating earnings of a loss of $1.56 per share and positive $1.30 per share, respectively. This brings 2017 year-to-date GAAP and operating earnings to $3.07 per share and $2.82 per share, respectively, versus 2016 year-to-date GAAP and operating earnings of $0.48 per share and $3.25 per share, respectively. We have narrowed the guidance range for 2017 to $3.55 to $3.68 per share to further define our guidance as we close out the year. And as I mentioned earlier, our board raised the dividend to $0.62 per share, a 5.1% increase that puts us solidly in our targeted 60% to 70% payout range. Beyond the numbers, I know there are several areas you probably want to hear about. One is, first would be Wind Catcher Energy Connection. This project continues to move forward. As previously discussed, we filed for state regulatory approvals at the end of July. And we now have procedural schedules in all four state jurisdictions that lead to hearings in the first quarter of 2018 : January in Oklahoma and Texas; February in Louisiana; and March in Arkansas. Wind Catcher represents a clear winner for customers, investors, economic development and the environment. At this point, I should figuratively drop the microphone, but we'll let the facts, $4.5 billion invested, $7.6 billion in customer savings, substantial infrastructure development and great use of wind resources speak for themselves. So I'm pleased with the progress of Wind Catcher so far. Moving on to our several rate cases to discuss and obviously, we're in a year of several rate cases. We got a summary on page 33, but at a high level, in Indiana, we filed a $263 million rate case of which $89 million is depreciation and amortization. The procedural schedule has been set with hearings in January. In Michigan, we filed a $51.7 million rate case with $23.4 million being depreciation and a procedural schedule has been set for those hearings this November and an order is expected in April of 2018. The Kentucky rate case that was filed in June requested a $65.4 million increase, and is now in settlement discussions with the parties. Hearings were set for December of this year, so we expect the results soon with this case. The Oklahoma rate case was filed in June for approximately $170 million, inclusive of about $14 million of AMI and reliability that we were already recovering through riders. In September, staff recommended a $132 million increase and the hearings are scheduled in late October, early November with an ALJ report expected December. As I mentioned last quarter, this case is extremely important with the outcome impacting future investment decisions in Oklahoma, including Wind Catcher. We are hopeful the Oklahoma Commission will send a positive message in this regard. At SWEPCO last December, we filed a base rate case in Texas requesting $105.9 million, offset by $36.9 million of reductions in TCRF, Transmission Cost Recovery Factor, and DCRF, Distribution Cost Recovery Factor, revenues netting to $69 million. This case include environmental retrofits and remaining net plan investments in the retired Welsh 2 unit. The ALJ in the case issued a decision in September, proposing a base rate increase of $51 million with a 9.6% ROE. We expect a PUCT decision by the end of the year on this case. In Ohio, in late August, we filed a joint stipulation settlement agreement among the parties in the ESP 3 extension case. The agreement covered distribution investment and enhanced reliability rider-related issues as well as Smart City investments in technology, continued OVEC recovery and other matters. It allows a 10% ROE for rider-related capital and commits the company to file a rate case in June 2020. Hearings commence this next week. Proposals are also due to AEP Ohio in December for 400 megawatts of solar, so we're looking forward to further investment in this area as well. Now, moving forward with the equalizer chart, overall, ROEs have come down from the previous quarter due to primarily weather, but also the pending rate case activity I just spoke about. With six different major rate cases, along with other regulatory activities, it has been quite a busy year. As I mentioned earlier, many of these cases do not get resolved until first quarter 2018, so we expect a gradual increase with ROEs for the fourth quarter. And then, in 2018, ROEs once again should be tracking approximately in the 10% overall range. So, as I go across looking at each one of the jurisdictions, I refer you to page 5 of the equalizer chart. Obviously, we have our two bubbles for AEP Ohio and that really talks about the difference between those legacy issues that are accounted for in the 12.6% versus what we're truly experiencing, the 11.1% that would be involved with the SEET test. So the ROE for AEP Ohio at the end of the third quarter 2017 was 12.6%, and it reflects rate relief associated with our distribution investment program, shared savings attributed to our energy efficiency programs, and the annual transmission formula rate true-up in lowering financing costs. The 12.6% ROE, as I said earlier, includes those legacy issues and the 11.1% does not, and that's the one that's evaluated for SEET-related activities. APCo, it has come down a little bit. At the end of the third quarter, it was 8.4%; in second quarter, it was 8.9%. And that really is driven primarily by weather and usage during that period. So in many of these, you'll see that as a sort of a crosscutting issue across the board is the weather-related activities associated with each one of these. Kentucky, the ROE at the end of the third quarter was 4.5% and, as you know, we filed the rate case there back in July of 2017, so a new rate should be effective around the January timeframe in 2018. But that being said, the long-term strategy around Kentucky is also centered around economic development. We had a large aluminum company that announced location within the company's territory, and we believe that's going to be a foundational part of some ancillary additions in load that can help from an economic development standpoint. So that's really a two-pronged effort there and Matt Satterwhite, our President down there, is doing a great job turning that around. I&M achieved an ROE of 8.4% at the end of the third quarter 2017. I&M's ROE has been impacted by weather, again, and formula base rate true-ups. I&M has filed base rate cases in both Indiana and Michigan, as I mentioned earlier, and those new rates are expected to be in place for both states in midyear 2018. PSO, we've talked about, the ROE at the end of the third quarter was 6.1% and it's primarily driven by regulatory lag from the last rate case, hopefully we'll make up some ground on that, and unfavorable weather. So we expect the new rates of PSO to be in effect by January of 2018. SWEPCO, the ROE for SWEPCO at the end of the third quarter was 5.9% and third quarter results were unfavorable because weather, again, but benefited from some lower O&M expense. SWEPCO also took a $6.3 million unfavorable adjustment due to the prior period income tax adjustment affecting the Dolet Hills Lignite Company subsidiary. And of course, we've had the formula base rate that was approved by the Louisiana Commission kick in during that period as well. And then, of course, we have a Texas case that I talked about earlier that we're expecting an outcome soon on as well. So moving on to AEP Texas, they are at a 10.3%. They have a steady ROE primarily attributable to increased revenues from the TCOS filing that was effective in late June, and then their Distribution Cost Recovery Factor filing that was effective in September. So all is good in AEP Texas. AEP Transmission Holdco, the ROE for AEP Transmission Holdco at third quarter has been 12.7%, primarily driven by 206 reserve which offsets most of the year-over-year rate base increase. The other driving factor is a decrease in ETT ROE as a result of settlement filed with the PUCT in January 2017 but all in all, going very well from a transmission standpoint. So with that discussion, obviously weather impacted just about every part of the system and then also we had hurricanes that hit. And I wanted to say \u2013 give a shout out to our employees and also the industry in terms of its support relative to Hurricane Harvey, Irma and others. This has been an interesting year from a weather perspective. So this quarter, once again, because of weather, we've been treading water, no pun intended. But again, I'm very proud of the employees who have been involved with not only eliminating most of the deficit that's occurred because of weather reductions but also the work they did relative to really recovering our nation from some pretty substantial storms. So, being a music buff, I can't help but recall the lyrics of a song by the group Dream Theater and which is one of my favorite drummers, Michael Portnoy and probably no one knows who they are but the song is called Another Day and the lyrics go \u2013 live another day, climb a little higher, find another reason to stay. Well, in 2017, because of our efforts to overcome the weather and other obstacles, we'll finish out the year 2017, we'll live for 2018 and continue on our path of reaffirming guidance centered on $3.85 per share and our 5% to 7% growth rate. The fundamentals of our business plan remain secure and we're confident going into 2018. Brian? Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Thank you, Nick, and good morning, everyone. I'll take us through the third quarter and year-to-date financial results, provide some insight on load and the economy, review our balance sheet and liquidity, and finish with a discussion of what we'll present at the EEI Conference. Let's begin on slide 6 which shows that operating earnings for the third quarter were $1.10 per share or $543 million compared to $1.30 per share or $640 million in 2016. This difference can be primarily attributed to the sale of competitive generation assets and mild weather. Let's look at the earnings drivers by segment. Earnings for the Vertically Integrated Utilities segment were $0.58 per share, down $0.13. The primary driver for this variance was cooler-than-normal weather this year compared to warmer weather last year. Other drivers in this segment include lower O&M and higher normalized retail margins, which were offset by higher depreciation and higher effective tax rate. The Transmission & Distribution Utilities segment earned $0.29 per share for the quarter, down $0.03 from last year. Unfavorable drivers in this segment included a higher effective tax rate, weather in Texas, lower sales in Ohio and increased depreciation. Partially offsetting these items was recovery of incremental investment to serve our customers. Our AEP Transmission Holdco segment continued to grow, contributing $0.15 per share for the quarter, an improvement of $0.01 over last year, reflecting a return on incremental investment. Net plant less deferred taxes grew by $1.1 billion, an increase of 30% since last September. The Generation & Marketing segment produced earnings of $0.07 per share, down $0.09 from last year. This segment realized lower earnings due to the sale of the competitive generating assets. Partially offsetting this impact were lower depreciation on the remaining assets, higher marketing revenues and lower overall expenses. Corporate and Other was up $0.04 per share from last year, primarily due to an investment gain and lower O&M. Let's turn to slide 7, and review our year-to-date results. Operating earnings through September were $2.82 per share or $1.4 billion compared to $3.27 per share or $1.6 billion in 2016. Similar to the quarter, this difference can primarily be attributed to unfavorable weather, the sale of the competitive generation assets and positive items that occurred last year that were not repeated this year. Offsetting these were transmission earnings and recovery of incremental investment. Looking at the drivers by segment. Earnings for the Vertically Integrated Utilities were $1.27 per share, down $0.43, with the single largest driver being weather, which negatively impacted earnings by $0.22. Favorable prior year items contributed to this difference, including formula rate true-ups, recognition of deferred billing in West Virginia and positive tax adjustments. Other rate relief was favorable due to the recovery of incremental investment across multiple jurisdictions. Additional variances in this segment include higher depreciation, lower AFUDC and lower retail margins, particularly in the East. Through September, the Transmission & Distribution Utilities segment earned $0.76 per share, down $0.03. Favorable drivers in this segment included rate changes and higher ERCOT transmission revenue. These were offset by several items including lower normalized load, the reversal of the regulatory provision in 2016 and higher effective tax rates, depreciation and O&M. AEP Transmission Holdco segment earnings through September were $0.56 per share, up $0.14 over last year. The growth in earnings included the implementation of deferred 205 forecasted transmission rates. This allowed for a one-time increase from historical expense true-ups to future-looking estimated expenses to be trued up in the subsequent period. This one-time adjustment will not be repeated in future periods. We experienced a slight decline in our joint venture earnings due to an ETT settlement earlier this year. The growth in earnings over last year also reflects a return on incremental investment. The Generation & Marketing segment produced earnings of $0.25 per share, down $0.15 from last year. This segment realized lower earnings due to the sale of the competitive generating assets, as expected. Partially offsetting this impact were lower depreciation on the remaining assets, positive impacts from solar projects going into service and lower overall costs. Finally, Corporate and Other was up $0.02 per share from last year due to investment gains and tax adjustments. For the year-to-date period, certain unfavorable comparisons to 2016 were anticipated, like the sale of the competitive generating assets and other favorable 2016 items. In response to the earnings impact from very mild weather, which continued into the third quarter, we have reduced O&M expenses compared to last year for the fourth quarter of this year. Because of the continued impact of weather and the fact that we have one quarter remaining in the year, as Nick said, we are narrowing our 2017 guidance range to $3.55 per share to $3.68 per share. Also as Nick said earlier, we anticipate growing at 5% to 7% off of our original 2017 guidance range and are reaffirming our 2018 operating earnings guidance range of $3.75 to $3.95 per share in 2018. Now, let's look at slide 8 to review normalized load performance. Starting with the lower right chart, our normalized retail sales decreased by 0.3% this quarter and we're down 0.2% for the year. For both comparisons, the growth in the industrial sector was offset by declining residential and commercial sales. Had it not been for the outages caused by Hurricane Harvey, our normalized sales would be flat for both the quarter and year-to-date periods. Moving clockwise, industrial sales increased by 1.9% for both the third quarter and year-to-date comparisons. We saw strong industrial sales growth across most of our operating companies and industries this quarter. The positive industrial performance these past two quarters are good indicators of future growth in our residential and commercial classes as the economic recovery works its way through our service territory. In the upper left chart, normalized residential sales were down 1.4% for the quarter and down 1.5% year-to-date. Story here differs by geography. Residential sales were up 0.5% in our Western footprint, where customer accounts increased by 0.7% in the third quarter. In the East, however, residential sales declined by 3%, where customer accounts were essentially flat. Finally, in the upper right chart, commercial sales for the quarter decreased by 1.3%, bringing the year-to-date normalized contraction to 0.7%. Turning to slide 9, let's take a deeper look at some of the indicators that were responsible for the stronger industrial load performance this year. The chart at the top illustrates why we are confident with the trend for this class. Since 2013, the majority of AEP industrial sales has been concentrated in the oil and gas sectors in AEP shale regions. While it was good to have growth from the energy sector, there was a concern that the industrial mix was becoming unbalanced as non-energy-related sales struggled. This concern was evident last year when energy prices fell, and the majority of our service territory fell into recession. As of the third quarter, all of our operating companies are now out of recession and in recovery mode for the first time since 2011. In addition, over the past two quarters, there is no longer a distinction between growth in the oil and gas and the rest of our industrial sectors. This balance is indicative of a healthier base from which AEP's economy can grow. The bottom left chart helps explain why we experienced recent improvement in the non-oil and gas sectors. The chart shows the strength of the U.S. dollar compared to the broad index of other currencies. In 2016, the strong dollar and weak global demand were significant headwinds for manufacturing in AEP service territory. Fortunately, the global economy is in a much better position in 2017 and the dollar has started to soften over the past two quarters, which coincides with the growth in industrial sales shown above. The current dollar index is the lowest it's been since 2015. The table in the bottom right corner shows some of the major export industries located in AEP's footprint that are benefiting from the weaker dollar. In total, these sectors represent nearly half of AEP's industrial sales. With that, let's review the status of our regional economies on slide 10. As shown in the upper left chart, our Eastern territory grew by 3.2% this quarter, which was 1.1% faster than the U.S. Our Western territory grew at 1.9%, which was a significant improvement from previous quarters. Looking at the growth in our East Vertically Integrated Utilities in the upper right chart, Kentucky Power remains the fastest growing territory in terms of GDP growth, notching an increase of 3.1% for the quarter. As you know, Kentucky Power's territory has a higher concentration of coal mining, which is growing for the first time in years. Appalachian Power's territory also has a high concentration of mining and is experiencing a similar trend, growing at 2.5%. Despite its GDP growth of 2.5%, Indiana Michigan Power has actually experienced sales declines in all three retail classes. Exposure to the automotive industry, which had a record-setting year in 2016, has moderated somewhat this year. The bottom left chart shows our West Vertically Integrated Utilities where SWEPCO's service territory saw 1.6% growth for the quarter. As expected, PSO came out of recession this quarter experiencing GDP growth of 0.6% driven by improvement in the oil and gas activity. Finally, the bottom right chart shows that both of our Transmission & Distribution Utilities continue to improve in the third quarter, with the growth in Ohio approximately 1% above that in Texas. The Ohio service territory is more diversified with growth coming from many sectors, such as manufacturing, construction, and education and health services. Overall, we are encouraged by the momentum of these economic trends in our service territory. Now, let's move to slide 11 and review the company's capitalization and liquidity. Our debt-to-total capital ratio increased 0.1% during the quarter to 54.6%. Our FFO-to-debt ratio is solidly in the BBB+ and Baa1 range at 17.4% and our net liquidity stands at about $3 billion, supported by our revolving credit facility. Our qualified pension funding improved approximately 1 percentage point to 100%. Plan assets increased due to strong returns and plan liabilities were essentially flat due to relatively stable interest rates. Our OPEB funding improved 2 percentage points during the quarter to 112%, with investment gains outpacing plan benefit payments and expenses. The estimated after-tax O&M expense for both plans for 2017 is expected to be unchanged from last year at about $15 million. Finally, our Treasury group continues to take advantage of robust low-cost debt capital markets to fund our spending program. In back-to-back weeks this quarter, we issued $700 million in senior notes for AEP Texas and $625 million in senior notes for AEP Transco. The 30-year spread on the Transco deal of T plus 100 basis points (25:53) was the lowest issuance spread for an AEP company since before the financial crisis and equal to the lowest for any utility senior unsecured 30-year notes since the start of 2015. Let's try to wrap this up on slide 12 and get to your questions. Despite the significant impact of mild weather on this year's earnings, we were able to find offsetting expense reductions that allow us to narrow operating earnings guidance within the original range to between $3.55 to $3.68 per share. Significant portion of those O&M savings will occur in the fourth quarter. Given our ability to put capital to work, serving our customers, we are also confident in reaffirming our 2018 operating earnings guidance range of $3.75 to $3.95 per share. We are also confident that there is significant runway in our capital programs to reaffirm our 5% to 7% operating earnings growth rate. As we always do, we will provide specifics with our presentation at the fall EEI Financial Conference. We will detail the drivers behind next year's earnings guidance. We will also provide detail around our capital expenditure plans, rate activity, cash flow and a more specific annual financing plan than we have provided in prior years. We look forward to seeing many of you in Orlando in about 10 days. With that, I will turn the call over to the operator for your questions. Operator : Thank you. And we will start with the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Good morning, Julien. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey, good morning. Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Good morning. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Congratulations on holding the line here on costs. Yeah, talk about it. Bring those dragons. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: We need them. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : I know. Oh man. Let me ask you real quickly if I can, on \u2013 let's just start with the weather really quickly. You talk about not exactly adding back that $0.13 year-over-year, how would you think about it? Obviously, you didn't change the 2017 number as much, just to hit that directly out of the gate here. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Yeah, when we look at the $0.13 \u2013 we're looking at this year like it is an anomaly. We're not doing anything stupid for reducing an O&M perspective. We are doing the tree trimming, we're doing all the things we need to do. But there is one-time things that we can do whether it's travel, whether it's all those kinds of things that employees can do to reduce costs and the efficiencies that we've seen from all the previous years' activities continue to inure to the benefit of O&M as well. So there's some opportunities for us to really respond to the weather-related activity. But keep in mind, we're very careful, we didn't want to move a bunch of stuff from 2017 into 2018 because there's things we need to do in 2017 and we want to keep the plan secure for 2018. So we really looked at it in that fashion. When you look at the weather and if it's weather adjusted $0.13, not all of it, so I think you do have some opportunity next year. I think it just makes us more confident about the midpoint for next year, particularly assuming we get any kind of normal weather. It would be great if we had a good winter before we had a bad summer or a good summer after we had a bad winter, but we had neither. And so all of the plans aligned negatively this year but to come out of it the way that we have I think really does show the ability to change our O&M profile to respond to it. I don't know, Brian, do you have anything you want to add to that? Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: No. We've kept O&M that's now been tracked flat essentially for the last seven years. And it's been lean activity, procurement activity, continuous improvement activity and we are advancing that activity and when we have the weather gap that we had this year, this management team knows what levers to pull to fill in that gap and we are not going to resort to gimmicks like factoring weather out. We know we're responsible for responding to what the weather is and trying to come in within our guidance range and that's exactly what this team has done. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Today, it's a different company than we had two years or three years ago with the unregulated generation. Today, I think it's much more transparent and the levers that you have to pull are still there in some regards, but weather will be more of a impact on the company than in previous years because then you had the market conditions that you could look at, and sometimes it saved you, sometimes it went against you, but that's all part of the process of making sure that we're consistent as we can be regardless of the situation. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Excellent. Thanks for the detail. Quick to follow-up on cleanup item here, we've seen some headlines around Oklaunion here. Can you comment just on, I presume that's fairly negligible in terms of earnings contribution to the extent which you were to transact on that? And presumably if you were, that would be all of it, that would not be any kind of specific portion of it? And then perhaps, in tandem with that, any thoughts here on Conesville given that the transfer has been completed for \u2013 a little bit here? Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Yeah, obviously, we're still looking at the unregulated generation from a strategic sense and Oklaunion has been a drag, particularly on the unregulated side, in the ERCOT portion of Texas. And just like any other base load generation, I don't think it gets the value it deserves for what it provides to the market. But that being said, yeah, any kind of result that we get out of Oklaunion, I wouldn't expect too much of a financial change as a result. And then as far as Conesville is concerned, we continue to look at that, we consolidate some interests in some of the units, but we continue to look at our options from that perspective as well. And really I didn't talk about those upfront in any of the areas, but just know that we continue to work with Buckeye and Cardinal and then of course, seeing what the disposition of those units can be in relation to all the other opportunities that we have but there's no doubt we continue our process of that strategic review. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got it. And just to clarify what this all meshes together to for your 2019, if you think about as you roll forward a few years that $0.10 of call it non-core utility earnings, the composition that is largely renewable by that point in time, or just how would you think about that given where you are in the plan on both the deployment of capital on the new generation assets as well as obviously getting rid of the legacy stuff? Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Oh, yeah, absolutely, Brian, do you want to... Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Yeah. So hedges that we have associated with our competitive generation and capacity revenues decline over time. And earnings from the renewable portion increases over time. Overall, we don't expect that business to be changing much from about the $0.10 contribution of earnings that it has in the near term. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: So if you look at 2018, 2019, 2020, you're seeing minimization of the contributions of the old legacy units, but we're maximizing the contribution of the renewables efforts, particularly in Chuck Zebula's area, the contracted renewables, but also very much so the regulated renewables. And as I mentioned earlier, we have an RFP out in AEP Ohio for solar and then, of course, Wind Catcher. You're going to see other projects like that, that are going to be drivers for those future years and we're very much looking forward to it. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Excellent. Thank you all very much. Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Yeah. Operator : We'll now go to the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Good morning, Jonathan. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi, good morning, guys. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Good morning. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: I've had just a question about the Transmission segment and obviously, you didn't provide for the quarter much a breakdown of the $0.01 of growth, but it seemed to be little slower than you've generally been seeing on investment growth. So I was curious, did you take any additional reserve against 206, or anything like that this quarter or just what's behind that $0.01? Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: So we did take reserve against the 206 for the quarter. For the year, contributing to that $0.14 improvement is the \u2013 what we're able to do in the FERC 205 as we're able to look at forward-looking O&M test years rather than truing up past years. And that contributed to the growth but we're pretty much on track with where we expected to be for the Transmission Holdco segment. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: You're going to see an anomaly with the credit of the 205. That's really some of what you're seeing, too, the true up associated with it. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: So that's the $0.09 that you're talking about on a year-to-date basis? Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Yes. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Yeah. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: And \u2013 but the \u2013 you're now reserved to the level that you think is a reasonable outcome for the 206 beyond the reserve you took earlier in the year, I guess? Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: We are, Jon. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: That's right. Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: And we think that issue is going to play out over a fairly long period of time with what's going on with the New England Transmission Owners case and its remand back to FERC. We think we'll be in a long period of having to reserve before that issue gets resolved. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah. And what drives the decision to up the reserve right now? Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Yeah, I don't think it's been an increase in the reserve. I think we've been steady about where it's been and have kept it held at that level. I think there are positive things to come out of the new FERC makeup and we're just going to hold steady for \u2013 until it gets resolved. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. But I thought you just said you did increase the reserve and that's why you didn't have growth this quarter, but now it sounds like maybe you didn't. Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: We did not increase the reserve. It's been steady. It's been constant. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: No, we didn't increase it, but the true-up hits in July. That's what happened. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And then, just one other, on Wind Catcher, we noticed earlier this week that Xcel proposed some sort of different terms to how they might look to get recovery in Texas. And I don't know if you have any comment on that \u2013 the base or framework or if you think that could end up being a template for how things might play for you? Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: No. I don't see it that way because these projects are pretty unique and the way you look at them, and ours has a 350-mile, 765kV generation interconnection associated with it, but it's also massively larger. So you can look at the risk being taken and the economics of the projects themselves. They stand on their own merits. So we filed our plan. I know that Xcel had to change theirs a little bit, but that's sort of their business and our projects are our business. So we'll continue with all four jurisdictions in the same manner in which we filed and we'll see where it goes. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. I think that's it. Thank you, guys. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Thank you. Operator : We'll now go to the line of Praful Mehta with Citigroup. Please go ahead. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks so much. Hi, guys. Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Hi, Praful. Good to see you. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi, same here. Just following up on Wind Catcher, I wanted to understand, of the $2.5 billion benefit that you've highlighted for the first 10 years, how important is that PTC? And do you see any risk to that PTC flowing through to the project itself? Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: That PTC is really important and that's why the brevity in which we're asking for approvals of this project are instrumental. I mean, the numbers stand for themselves. The numbers are just, like I said earlier, a slam dunk. But when you look at the $2.5 billion PTC, that's a huge part of the economics associated with making sure our customers can benefit from that so \u2013 and timing is critical. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Got you. So I guess, when do we get color on like the likelihood of the timing? And what kind of risks does it bring to the approvals, I guess? Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Yes. So, obviously, we filed \u2013 and I'm really actually happy that the procedural schedules have been set up pretty consistent and constructive of getting a solution in place. I mean, all four jurisdictions have procedural schedules that match-up to sort of our April timeframe that we're looking at, so that we can really take a hard look at what the risks are, what the rewards will be, what the result of the Commission's orders will be. That will give us some real insight in terms of this project. But like I said before, I'm pleased with the progress that's been made. Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Praful, you may... Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Fair enough. Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Praful, you may not have gotten to it, yet, but slide 32 of our presentation, we kind of lay out the timeline in each of the jurisdictions and when we expect hearings to begin. And you can anticipate orders shortly after those hearings take place. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Got you. Thanks. And then in terms of the pending rate cases, obviously, you have a pretty busy regulatory schedule. Just wanted to understand, your ROEs for all these rate cases are in the 10% to 10.5% range, is there any risk given current interest rate environment on those ROEs? Or do you see those ROEs \u2013 authorized ROEs to be pretty stable? Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: I think we are pretty consistent, as we talked earlier about 2018 being in that approximately 10% range, and of course, it's going to result from negotiations or from the outcomes of these cases. And so as we look at it, the aggregation of those cases will be in that approximate 10% range, that's what you should look for. And of course, we filed \u2013 the normal course of rate cases. I mean, you file based upon what we really believe the ROE should be and then, the course, you have to deal with other parties and deal with the \u2013 and the Commission itself will make the decision on what the ultimate ROE is. And like I said earlier, we expect our aggregated to be around that 10% range. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Got you. Thanks so much, guys. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Yeah. Operator : And we'll now go to the line of John Barta with KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Good morning, John. John J. Barta - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I just want to better understand how interrelated the wind plant and gen-tie for Wind Catcher are, were hypothetically, is the capital associated with the wind side were reduced a little bit? Is the need still there for the 765 kilovolt gen-tie? Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Oh, yeah, they go hand-in-hand. Obviously, you would be building a huge wind farm to nowhere if you don't have the generation interconnection there. And so with \u2013 and with 2,000 megawatts of wind capacity at that location, that drives a pretty large substantial generation interconnection. And even if you \u2013 in this case, you won't reduce the size of it, but the size of the wind farm is really the big driver on the capacity side associated with the size of the generation interconnect. So they go hand-in-hand. One doesn't occur without the other and that's why it's all being viewed as a single project. And that's why we're working really hard to lock in the arrangements associated with construction on both sides, so that we can eliminate as much risk as possible. John J. Barta - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. That's it. Operator : And we have exhausted all questions in queue at this time. Please continue. Bette Jo Rozsa - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Okay, well, thank you, everyone, for joining us on today's call. As always, the IR team will be available to answer any additional questions you may have. Rich, would you please give the replay information. Operator : Certainly.

I will now turn the conference call over to your host, Ms. Betty Jo Rozsa. Please go ahead. Betty Jo Rozsa : Thank you, Tawanda. Good morning everyone and welcome to the fourth quarter 2017 earnings call for American Electric Power. Thank you for taking the time to join us today. Our earnings release, presentation slides, and related financial information are available on our website at aep.com.  Today we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause these results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors. Our presentation also includes references to non-GAAP financial information. Please refer to the reconciliation of the applicable GAAP measures provided in the appendix of today\u2019s presentation.  Joining me this morning for opening remarks are Nick Akins, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Brian Tierney, our Chief Financial Officer. We will take your questions following their remarks. I will now turn the call over to Nick. Nicholas Akins : Thanks Betty Jo. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today for AEP\u2019s fourth quarter 2017 earnings call. I know many of you are happy to get 2017 in the rear view mirror and move onto 2018, but I would say that we ended 2017 very strong. I mentioned in the third quarter earnings call for those who watch Game of Thrones, Khaleesi\u2019s dragons didn\u2019t show up for the heat of the summer but we definitely spent the beginning of winter at the North Wall of the White Walkers - it was really cold. As a matter of fact, one of my family members had the great idea that I could barbecue chicken wings on New Year\u2019s Day for the football games, so I was outside in 10 degree weather grilling wings. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll do that again. But all in all, though I was cold outside as a shareholder, I was warm inside as we sold a lot of comfort to our customers during this cold spell.  So starting with our financial performance for the fourth quarter, we came in with GAAP earnings at $0.81 per share versus $0.76 per share in 2016, and operating earnings at $0.85 per share and $0.67 per share in 2016. This brought the 2017 year-to-date total GAAP earnings to $3.89 per share versus $1.24 per share in 2016, and 2017 year-to-date total operating earnings to $3.68 per share versus $3.94 per share in 2016. The $3.68 per share for 2017 landed at the top end of our revised guidance, so we ended in very good fashion leading into 2018, and looking at AEP\u2019s total shareholder return, we have consistently over the last one, three and five-year periods provided comparable returns to the S&P 500 and consistently outperformed by a wide margin the S&P 500 electric utilities index, the very definition of a premium regulated utility company. Our regulated operating ROE came in at 9.5% return for the year, and in 2017 we increased the quarterly dividend by 5.1%, so even with the headwinds of weather and the need for rate case recovery, AEP provided a very respectable year to our investors while providing quality service to our customers. Our employees continue to drive efficiencies across our business, which certainly played a significant role in meeting shareholder expectations in 2017. We dealt with major storm events with Hurricane Harvey, which was a direct hit to our AEP Texas territory, as well as provided support in Florida as a result of Hurricane Irma. We currently have AEP employees in devastated Puerto Rico helping with the recovery and rebuilding efforts there as well and certainly wish them a safe return. For 2018, we are maintaining our guidance range for the year of $3.75 to $3.95 per share and reaffirming our growth rate of 5 to 7% operating earnings. We will be investing $6 billion in capital substantially in the regulated entities, with the vast majority of that being wires related to provide reliability and quality of service to our customers. Disciplined execution and capital allocation will be key for us to meet our financial objectives. Obviously the rate case outcomes in the various jurisdictions that I will discuss later will be a key component of these allocation decisions. I was recently asked what song would be a good one to pick for this quarter to illustrate the quarter, and it has to be Taxman by the Beatles. Tax reform has definitely been at the forefront, taking center stage. As we adjust the outcome of tax reform, our focus is no different - allocation of capital, maintaining credit quality, and ensuring our consistent growth trajectory. In this case, we are also working with our state commissions to provide tax reform benefits to our customers as well, whether it be rate reductions, accelerated depreciation, additional capital projects that provide value to our customers, or other opportunities. We also, because of our strong credit metrics, are able to maintain a significant portion of our capital investment plans while not issuing any additional equity beyond what we provided at the last EEI financial conference. Brian will discuss this a little bit later. As you know, we have several rate cases that were filed in 2017 that we expect outcomes generally in early 2018. Rate case filings were made in Indiana, Michigan, Kentucky, Oklahoma and Texas, and we still have an outstanding ESP case in Ohio that we await the outcome as well. Additionally, as you all know, we\u2019ve filed for state regulatory approvals for the Wind Catcher project in Oklahoma, Texas, Louisiana and Arkansas. First regarding Wind Catcher, I\u2019m very pleased with the cases our teams are putting forward in all the jurisdictions. Sure, investors in opposition do what interveners do, but overall our regulatory teams have demonstrated the benefits of the project. The schedules in the various jurisdictions continue to be largely on path to complete in a timely basis for approvals. We are having settlement discussions where they can occur, and we\u2019ll continue to do so where appropriate. Wind Catcher is a very unique opportunity, and our willingness to take on risk associated with this project while also providing all the benefits to the customers is a testament that we really are trying to do something good for customers.  AEP is advancing this project because we believe strongly in the benefits it will provide Day 1 to our customers, our environment, and to the economies of the states involved. Because we provide such a critical service to our customers and communities we serve, AEP has a public trust to balance the needs of our investors with our customers and our other stakeholders. We are in a very critical time in the life of this project, and this is where AEP, our customers and our regulators need to make this happen. In my mind, it would be an absolute travesty to let this unique hedge against the market pass, and I remain confident that it will get done. All the rate cases continue to move forward. Commission orders have been received in Texas and Kentucky that were generally constructive, and we await orders in Indiana, Michigan and Oklahoma as well as the ESP case in Ohio. All the cases are moving according to plan, and the next couple of quarters will certainly answer many rate-related and ROE questions in these jurisdictions. We are certainly hopeful that the Oklahoma commission will revise the ALJ\u2019s recommendation in the rate case to send a message that Oklahoma is truly open for business and allow AEP to continue to make substantial investments in the energy infrastructure in that state. As we have explained previously, we have the best customer satisfaction, the best service quality and the lowest rates. We just need to be able to attract a fair return on our investments in Oklahoma. After our previous disappointing rate case and a disappointing ALJ recommendation on our current case, we are hopeful that the Oklahoma commission will arrest this negative trend. With an authorized ROE of 9.5% but actually only recovering a 6% ROE, and if the ALJ recommendation has approved in its presence form only a 5% ROE, these results would be unattractive given AEP\u2019s other investment opportunities. Now that PSO is on negative credit outlook by Moody\u2019s, a positive result is even more important. So now I\u2019ll move to the equalizer graph and explain some of the cases that we have ongoing. First of all, overall we\u2019ve continued to have a 9.5% ROE, and over the 12-month period we have had some delays during the year that moved into \u201918, and certainly weather has impacted \u201917 as well overall. You\u2019ll hear that in many of the cases going across the equalizer graph. So for AEP Ohio, the ROE for AEP Ohio at the end of fourth quarter 2017 was 14.2%, but you have to keep in mind that that 14.2% includes the legacy issues that were resolved from the global settlements that had been done earlier, so really when you look at the seed-adjusted ROE, we\u2019re right around 10% in AEP Ohio, so we\u2019re in a good place there. Those legacy issues will roll off over time - some roll off in \u201918, some roll off in \u201919, so you\u2019ll start to see those two bubbles come closer together and in fact become the same bubble as we move forward. As far as APCo is concerned, the ROE for APCo at the end of the fourth quarter was 8.9%, which it was 8.4% at the end of the third quarter, so they are making progress; but again, it reflects weather for the entire year. They\u2019re overall at a good place right now. Kentucky Power, we obviously--that was a work in progress last year. It was 4.5% ROE at the end of third quarter, 5.1%, so it\u2019s moving up a little bit. It should move up even more now given that we have an outcome of a rate case. That rate case, the final order approved a $12.4 million increase, and it was--the settlement was actually adjusted there for certainly the impacts of tax reform. So all in all, constructive outcome from that perspective. Long-term solution for Kentucky Power, though, will again--the rates was only a part of it. The other is the economic development that\u2019s occurring in those regions, and we are getting some positive progress there relative placements of large manufacturing in our territories, so that\u2019s a good outcome, and we expect that to continue to improve. I&M achieved an ROE of 8.4% at the end of the fourth quarter 2017, which is unchanged from third quarter. Again, you probably know we have Indiana case and our Michigan case, both rate cases filed in those jurisdictions, and would expect an outcome of those in the next couple of quarters. So those cases move forward and certainly that should help to improve I&M. As far as PSO is concerned, we\u2019ve already talked about that pretty extensively at this point. Their fourth quarter ROE was 6.2% versus 6.1% at the end of the third quarter, and of course we\u2019re looking for the Oklahoma commission to adjust the recommendations of the ALJ at this point and hopefully have a good outcome associated with that rate case, which we expect an order very soon. That will certainly bode well for the continuation of Wind Catcher, and certainly that case continues to move forward in Oklahoma as well, so a lot of cases coming in and Oklahoma is at the epicenter of the activity associated with investments that we\u2019re making. SWEPCO, ROE at SWEPCO at the end of the fourth quarter was 6.4%, at the end of the third quarter it was 5.9%. We did get a final order on the PUCT case, Public Utility Commission of Texas, that was constructive, so we expect that ROE to continue to improve as well. Just keep in mind, we still have that 88 megawatts of Turk hanging out there that will continue to be a slight drag to the ROE overall of SWEPCO. So as we look at AEP Texas, AEP Texas at the end of fourth quarter 2017 was 10%, and it was 10.3% last quarter, and AEP Texas decreased due to a tax refund that dropped out of the calculation that was taking place in there. Of course, AEP Transmission, the ROE for AEP Transmission holdco at the end of fourth quarter was 12.6%. It was 12.7% at the end of third quarter 2017, so fairly consistent, and we continue to see great things from AEP Transmission and we expect that to continue.  So overall, regulated operations at 9.5% and we\u2019ll continue to see--all those, as we\u2019ve discussed with you earlier, gives you a very good view of the ones that need to move up and those that are in the middle of rate cases, and we expect those outcomes in the next couple of quarters, so that will be very instructive to us going forward relative to where we put our investments.  So for fourth quarter \u201917, it was an outstanding quarter, and the year\u2019s results exemplify the resiliency and the commitment of AEP\u2019s employees to deliver consistent earnings and dividend quality, regardless of the headwinds that may exist. We\u2019re very proud of 2017, and as we move into 2018, the year of tax reform, Wind Catcher, rate cases, and also forging ahead with Smart Cities, Ohio\u2019s PowerForward project, and other forward-thinking initiatives, this will set the tone for the years to come. I\u2019ll turn it over to Brian at this point. Brian? Brian Tierney : Thank you, Nick, and good morning everyone. I\u2019ll take us through the fourth quarter and year-to-date financial results, provide some insight on load and the economy, review our balance sheet and liquidity, discuss tax reform, and finish with a review of our outlook for 2018.  Let\u2019s begin on Slide 7, which shows that operating earnings for the fourth quarter were $0.85 per share or $420 million, compared to $0.67 per share or $330 million in 2016. All of our regulated segments experienced growth for the quarter compared to last year, and as expected our competitive generation and marketing business was down due to last year\u2019s asset sales. All the detail by segment is shown in the boxes on the chart, but overall the growth in our regulated business was driven by lower O&M, return on incremental investment, and positive weather impacts all partially offset by a higher effective tax rate. The generation and marketing segment produced earnings of $0.05 per share, down a nickel from last year. The impact of the sale of the competitive assets was partially offset by lower operating expenses on the remaining assets and higher trading revenues. Corporate and other was up $0.05 per share from last year primarily due to lower O&M and favorable tax adjustments. Turning to Slide 8, our annual operating earnings for 2017 were $3.68 per share or $1.8 billion, compared to $3.94 per share or $1.9 billion in 2016. This difference can be primarily attributed to unfavorable weather, the sale of the competitive generation assets, and positive items that occurred last year that were not repeated this year. Offsetting these were lower O&M, higher transmission earnings, and recovery of incremental investment to serve our customers.  Looking at the drivers by segment, earnings for the vertically integrated utilities were $1.64 per share, down $0.37 with one of the largest drivers being weather, which had a negative impact of $0.18. This difference was driven by the warm summer in 2016 which increased our cooling load compared to the warm winter in 2017, which decreased our heating load. Favorable prior year items also contributed to this difference, including formula rate true-ups, recognition of deferred billing in West Virginia, and positive tax adjustments. Other rate relief was favorable due to the recovery of incremental investment across multiple jurisdictions, and we reduced O&M in response to the unfavorable weather in 2017. Additional variances in this segment include higher depreciation and taxes other than income taxes, along with lower AFUDC.  The transmission and distribution utilities segment earned $1.01 per share, up $0.06. Favorable drivers in this segment included rate changes, higher ERCOT transmission revenue, the prior year Ohio global settlement, and lower O&M. These were offset by several items, including lower normalized load, the reversal of a regulatory provision in 2016, and higher depreciation and taxes. The AEP Transmission holdco segment earned $0.72 per share, up $0.18 over 2016. The growth in earnings over last year largely reflected our return on incremental investment. Net plant less deferred taxes grew by $2.1 billion, an increase of 52% since last December. The growth in earnings also reflected the implementation of the FERC 205 forecasted transmission rates as well as the normal historical expense true-up. Finally, we experienced a slight decline in our joint venture earnings due to an ETT settlement in 2017. Generation and marketing produced earnings of $0.30 per share, down $0.20 from last year. This segment realized lower earnings due to the sale of assets. Partially offsetting this impact were lower depreciation on the remaining assets, positive impacts from solar projects going into service, higher trading revenues, lower taxes, and lower overall costs. Finally, corporate and other was up $0.07 per share from last year due to investment gains, lower O&M, and taxes.  2017 was a re-basing year following the sale of the competitive generation assets. We are pleased with our operating earnings for the year which were achieved despite the headwinds from very mild weather.  Now let\u2019s take a look at Slide 9 to review weather-normalized load. Starting with the lower right chart, our normalized retail sales increased by 1.6% this quarter and ended the year up three-tenths of a percent. It has taken some time, but we finally saw the growth in residential sales we expected following the steady expansion of industrial sales that started last spring, particularly in the west.  Moving clockwise, industrial sales increased by 5.6% for the quarter and ended the year up 2.8%. There were two reasons for this increase. First, we saw broad industrial sales growth across most of our operating companies and industries this quarter. In fact, our five largest industrial sectors experienced nearly 11% growth this quarter, led by chemicals and primary metals. Second, in the fourth quarter two large co-generators on our system took their units offline for routine maintenance and purchased their needs from us. Moving to the upper left chart, normalized residential sales were up two-tenths of a percent for the quarter and down 1.2% for the year. The story here differs by geography. Residential sales were up 1.8% in our western footprint where customer counts increased by seven-tenths of a percent in the fourth quarter. In the east, however, residential sales declined by nine-tenths of a percent despite the three-tenths of a percent increase in customer counts.  Finally in the upper right chart, commercial sales for the quarter decreased by 1.2%, bringing the year-to-date normalized contraction to eight-tenths of a percent. Commercial sales declined at every operating company in 2017 except AEP Texas, with the most pronounced drop in Appalachian and Kentucky Power. Despite this, we still expect a modest improvement in 2018 as the economic recovery works its way through the business cycle. Next, let\u2019s review the status of our regional economies on Slide 10. As shown in the upper left chart, GDP growth in AEP service territory exceeded the U.S. by nearly seven-tenths of a percent in the fourth quarter. Higher energy prices and the strong global economy in 2017 were the primary drivers for this improvement. For the quarter, the western footprint grew at 3.4% with the growth in our eastern territory following close behind at 3.3%. The bottom left chart shows the gap in employment growth is closing between AEP and the U.S. Once again, the strongest job growth occurred in our western territory at 1.3%, which was only a tenth of a percent behind the U.S. Employment growth in our eastern territory closely followed at 1.1%. The final chart to the right shows the net jobs created in AEP service territory in 2017 by sector. In total, there were approximately 87,000 more people working in AEP\u2019s footprint at the end of 2017 than at the start of the year. Over 60% of the new jobs added in 2017 came from three categories : education and health services, professional business services, and manufacturing. These categories typically represent higher wage jobs which should support residential sales growth in 2018. The exception was the retail sector, which lost nearly 5,500 jobs in 2017. As you know, more people are choosing to shop online as opposed to traditional big box stores. Despite this outlier, we are encouraged by the momentum of economic trends in our service territory and still expect modest growth in 2018.  Now let\u2019s move to Slide 11 and review the company\u2019s capitalization and liquidity. Our debt to total capital ratio increased nine-tenths of a percent during the quarter to 55.5%. Our FFO to debt ratio was solidly in the Baa1 range at 18.7%, and our net liquidity stood at about $2.3 billion supported by our revolving credit facility. Our qualified pension funding improved approximately one percentage point to 101%. Despite a lower discount rate, gains from plan assets outpaced an increase in the plan liability due to strong market returns.  Our OPAB funding improved 18 percentage points during the quarter to 130% primarily due to strong investment returns and a change in the medical coverage for post-65 retirees. This change lowered the estimated OPAB liability and annual expense. The estimated cost for both plants in 2018 is expected to reduce after-tax expense by $53 million. Let\u2019s turn to Slide 12 now and talk about tax reform. Remember back two years ago when bonus depreciation was extended. At that time, we were getting increased cash due to not having to pay cash taxes. In response, the company did what Congress had hoped it would do and increased our capital expenditures for the benefit of our customers. This increase in capex had the effect of offsetting increased ADIT balances, so the story that we talked about then was lower cash taxes, increased retained cash, increased capex, increased customer benefits, and steady growth rate. In contrast to that story, let\u2019s talk about what tax reform and the elimination of bonus depreciation means to AEP - lower taxes, lower cash metrics, but also reduced ADIT balances, so if we largely maintain our capital spending program for the benefit of customers in the face of lower cash metrics, then we can maintain our previously forecasted growth rates. That is exactly what we plan to do. We plan to maintain our capital spending forecast of approximately $6 billion in 2018 and $6.2 billion in 2019, and to reduce our 2020 capital spending forecast by $500 million to about $5.5 billion. Our credit metrics will move from the high end of the Baa1 range to the lower end, but we do not anticipate raising incremental equity due to tax reform. We still anticipate raising $100 million through equity programs in each year 2018 through 2020, and an additional $400 million in 2020. This represents no change in equity needs from what we discussed with you at EEI in November, and we are reaffirming our 5 to 7% growth rate. Finally, as was the case at EEI in November, this plan does not include Wind Catcher.  Two other questions we often get are related to the deductibility of interest on parent debt and whether or not we have a significant net operating loss carry-forward. We expect interest on our parent debt to be mostly tax deductible and we are going into 2018 without a significant net NOL. Most of our state commissions have already opened documents related to changes in the tax law. We have begun working with regulators to determine the appropriate mechanisms to provide the customer benefits of both the change in tax rate and the excess ADIT. We have several options, including decreasing rates, increasing the amortization of regulatory assets, accelerating depreciation, and offsetting other rate increases. Overall, we\u2019ll maintain our credit metrics in the Baa1 range and stay within our earnings growth rate of 5 to 7% while customers get the benefit of continued investment and lower taxes.  Let\u2019s try to wrap this up on Slide 13 so we can get to your questions. We begin 2018 with a solid track record. Regulated earnings were strong in 2017 as we continue to invest capital in our regulated businesses. For seven years now, we have maintained O&M discipline and kept spending in a tight range of between $2.8 billion and $3.1 billion. In addition, over time we have grown our dividend with earnings, and expect to be able to do so going forward. Last year, AEP\u2019s board of directors increased the quarterly dividend by 5.1% on an annual basis.  Looking ahead to 2018, we are reiterating our operating earnings guidance of $3.75 to $3.95 per share. We are also confident that there is significant runway in our capital programs to reaffirm our 5 to 7% operating earnings growth rate. We will finalize our pending rate cases, obtain clarity on the Wind Catcher project, and continue working with regulators to provide the best solution around the customer benefits of tax reform.  With that, I will turn the call over to the Operator for your questions. Operator : [Operator instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Greg Gordon with Evercore. Your line is open. Nicholas Akins : Hey Greg, how are you? Greg Gordon : Oh, I can\u2019t complain. It\u2019s still cold here, but we know that\u2019s good for demand, so I\u2019ll take it. Nicholas Akins : That\u2019s good. Greg Gordon : Brian, a couple questions for you. First, I was modestly distracted when you mentioned that you\u2019re making a reduction in expenses due to change in benefit costs. That was a prospective savings of how much? Brian Tierney : It\u2019s going to be a credit for us to costs of about $53 million. Greg Gordon : Okay, thank you. Then you said parent interest expense would be mostly tax deductible, which means it\u2019s not completely tax deductible. Can you elaborate on why you chose that language? Brian Tierney : Yes Greg, so the IRS hasn\u2019t written their rules yet, but we think what\u2019s allowed for in the tax law is that parent company interest expense can be allocated to both our regulated properties and to our competitive businesses. In the regulated properties, they will be fully deductible; in our competitive properties, we\u2019ll have significant EBITDA to be able to deduct that as well. What will be left behind will be a very small portion which will be allocable to the parent, which doesn\u2019t have EBITDA associated with it, and that\u2019s the small portion that we think will not be deductible. Greg Gordon : Can you quantify for us at this time a range of dollars in terms of debt that you think will not qualify? Brian Tierney : About $1 million tax affected. Greg Gordon : Okay, so which really is de minimis. Brian Tierney : I couldn\u2019t say zero and be fully forthcoming. There is a small part that\u2019s left. Greg Gordon : Fair enough now you\u2019ve disclosed it - thank you. Did you say that the major factor that drove industrial demand up in the fourth quarter was these two co-gen facilities shutting down and taking demand from you, and so that\u2019s why you don\u2019t consider that an ongoing trajectory of demand? Brian Tierney : No, that was a small portion of it. We think the larger portion of it was really the broad growth across most of our industrial sectors. Greg Gordon : So why are you sort of reverting to a very low expected demand growth forecast in 2018? Is that out of a function of conservatism or are you fairly confident you\u2019re seeing things in the Q4 data that were not permanent? Brian Tierney : It\u2019s that small portion that was associated with the co-gens that\u2019s not permanent, and again we don\u2019t want to overstate the industrial growth because of that portion, and as we look forward and forecast the full year 2018, we look at what we think are expansions, we look at what we think the growth rate it, and we think we\u2019ve got that forecasted appropriately with the essentially flat that we\u2019re estimating for industrial in 2018. Greg Gordon : Okay. My last question and then I\u2019ll cede the floor, it looks to me that the ALJ position in Oklahoma, which looks incredibly confiscatory to me as well, is as much as an $0.08 or $0.09 swing in the expected earnings versus what you asked for in the case. Now, that would be well within the range of guidance you gave for 2018, so is it fair that even though there is a fairly large swing in outcomes there, that you reiterated your guidance because you\u2019re so comfortable you can be in there? Then the second question is, what\u2019s your recourse to Oklahoma if they in fact, other than just pulling capital out of the state or selling the company if indeed the ALJ decision comes down as approved as rendered? Nicholas Akins : Greg, certainly our guidance that we\u2019ve given, we\u2019re very comfortable with that guidance that we\u2019ve given, and actually Oklahoma is one of our smaller jurisdictions, so--but that being said, we still expect a good outcome in Oklahoma. On your second point, I think when you go in one case, which was our previous case, and you\u2019re looking to repair the balance sheet and make sure that PSO is moving forward in a positive fashion from an investment standpoint, we pulled several hundred million dollars of investment out of Oklahoma after that last rate case, and the present rate case, to have an ALJ recommendation that\u2019s not helpful at all in terms of continuing the recovering of PSO, if the commission follows suit with that, that\u2019s just another really bad message about investment in Oklahoma.  We have other places to put our capital. We have plenty of places to put our capital, and so Oklahoma would wind up being sort of in the red area like Kentucky was. That\u2019s something we take very seriously because we want to make investment in Oklahoma. It\u2019s a well-run utility, as I said earlier. When you look at the performance of PSO in relation to its customers and the rate making and everything, it doesn\u2019t deserve the ROE recommendation and it doesn\u2019t deserve the outcomes that we\u2019re getting in Oklahoma. So we have to look at that and see what the broad view is. Now there again, it is an ALJ recommendation, and the commission itself will be making the determination, and we\u2019re certainly hopeful that those adjustments will be made and that\u2019s what we expect to happen. You brought up the issues of what the responses could be - obviously we could pull capital out of Oklahoma, we could look at strategic options for Oklahoma, but that\u2019s really--let\u2019s don\u2019t get there yet, because we\u2019re going to let the commission speak on this. I really believe that the commission will be responsive, so let\u2019s just wait and see what that order looks like. Greg Gordon : Okay, thank you guys. Have a great day. Operator : Next we\u2019ll go to the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Jonathan Arnold : Good morning guys. Nicholas Akins : How you doing, Jonathan? Jonathan Arnold : Good, thank you. Thanks for all the clarity that you\u2019ve given this morning. One question on--can you give us some sort of sense of where you think the rate base for (indiscernible) to get out to 2020 shakes out versus the--I think you have 13.1 as the forecast at EEI. Brian Tierney : Yes, what we\u2019d previously shown you at EEI was a CAGR for that over the 18 to 20 period of about 8%. We anticipate it will be about 9%. Jonathan Arnold : Okay, that\u2019s great. Thank you, Brian. Presumably as we\u2019re sort of thinking about the earnings implications, the main offset is the higher financing costs on more debt with the lower FFO, increasing your financing needs albeit without equity. Brian Tierney : Our rating is going to stay the same-- Jonathan Arnold : No, no, but you have more debt, obviously, in the forecast. Brian Tierney : True. Jonathan Arnold : So to that, I was going to--I mean, you\u2019re now talking about mid-teens as your FFO to debt target. I think one of the slides from EEI was sort of mid to high teens. Can you give us sort of hundreds of basis points net effect of what you think is going to happen to that metric? Brian Tierney : Yes, so Jonathan, remember we were showing in the upper teens back then and people were saying to us, hey, you need to consume more of that balance sheet capacity and grow more than what you\u2019re showing, and what we always said to people back then was, we anticipate being a significant taxpayer around 2020 and that\u2019s going to consumer some of that balance sheet and drop us from the high teens into the mid-teens. We\u2019re now anticipating bottoming out in the 14% FFO to debt range before we start climbing again. Nicholas Akins : I\u2019ll just add onto that, I think it\u2019s probably a testament to the sound financial condition of what Brian and the team has been doing for this organization, to be able to absorb the tax reform implications without issuing additional equity. I mean, in essence what we\u2019re doing is trading FFO to debt and that ability to carry that against not having to issue equity, so it\u2019s a positive outcome for our shareholders. Jonathan Arnold : Absolutely, we just wanted to get behind what\u2019s in those numbers. Then finally as we try to compare the capex, where you\u2019re taking the $500 million out of the 2020 number, it looks like you\u2019ve got some moving parts in there, but the corporate pieces, I was just curious what\u2019s behind that and some of the other moving parts in the capex forecast. Brian Tierney : Jonathan, it\u2019s really going to be across the breadth of our businesses. Transmission will be a bit of that, environmental will be a piece of that. Contracted renewables will be a small piece of that. It will largely be spread across our business, but our interest in terms of how we allocate capital, transmission is still a preferred place for us to put capital, distribution and the wire side is still a preferred place for us to put capital, and there will be small portions associated with competitive renewable and some portion still associated with environmental at our generation. So largely spread across our businesses, but our preferences for where we put capital to work will remain the same. Jonathan Arnold : Okay, and then just finally, do you see this as pretty set, or is there a chance that the numbers shift around a bit depending on how your conversations with states go, which you\u2019re obviously saying are in process? Brian Tierney : So clearly that portion about how we allocate the excess deferred income tax back to our customers is something that\u2019s in play, and since it\u2019s in play across 11 jurisdictions, all of which may have different interests, that\u2019s something that we will firm up over time. We don\u2019t anticipate there to be a strategic change in our numbers that would have our capital and financing plans change materially. Nicholas Akins : Unless of course we get Wind Catcher. Brian Tierney : Well Wind Catcher, of course, is a big change. I was answering the question in regards to tax reform. Wind Catcher is a big change and that would clearly require us to come back out to you and explain how we\u2019re going to finance that. Jonathan Arnold : And is the assumption that Wind Catcher would displace other things, or is it partially incremental? Can you remind us how we should think about that? Brian Tierney : Jonathan, it\u2019s a $4.5 billion project, so that is a significant change to what we\u2019ve talked about in our capital and financing plans, so we\u2019d need to come out to you and tell you a complete story about what Wind Catcher means, when we get approvals and when we decide to go forward with that project. Jonathan Arnold : Okay, thank you. Operator : Next we\u2019ll go to the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Nicholas Akins : Morning Steve. Steve Fleishman : Hey, good morning. A couple questions, first on the Wind Catcher. You had talked about making a decision by maybe March-April, I think. Is that the still rough timeline, you think? Nicholas Akins : Yes, I think the schedules are still moving towards April. We had a two-week delay in Texas for the tax reform implications, but the other jurisdictions are pretty well--have pretty well stayed intact, so we\u2019re still looking at the same time frame and really we need to make that we get those kinds of responses so that we can make decisions about the other commitments relative to the project. We\u2019re still in good shape. Steve Fleishman : Yes, and in terms of just your conviction level on it, it seems like the recommendations so far have generally not been that good in any of the states, or maybe one of them, so I\u2019m just--but you did talk about maybe some settlement talks in certain states. Maybe you could talk about which ones are able, and why you\u2019d be convinced you can still get this moving forward? Nicholas Akins : Yes, so many of these recommended rejections have been caveated with, okay, if you do move forward, we need these kinds of protections in place, and that really tends to be the center of the discussion and the center of the testimony. The thing is these cases, and you probably read the transcripts like I do - I get irritated with the transcripts half the time because it\u2019s really arguments on the fringes, and a lot more discussion needs to be had about the benefits of the project and the benefits of a hedge and that kind of thing, but you argue on the fringes and a lot of it is risk adjustments associated with the project that allow for customer protections to be in place relative to the project benefits. We\u2019re certainly encouraging that all interveners propose what they want to get approved. There is obviously--you know, as we go through discussions with the interveners, it\u2019s important for us to be able to have those discussions wherever we can, and certainly we\u2019re having those discussions certainly with Oklahoma and in Texas. Those discussions continue. I can\u2019t really talk about the content of those discussions because obviously they\u2019re confidential, but again we\u2019ve made additional guarantees and rebuttal testimony, we\u2019ve put that out as a framework for those customer protection type of mechanisms, and you might suspect that\u2019s where the dialog is centered. Steve Fleishman : Okay, but Oklahoma is one of the states where you might have discussions, as you say? Nicholas Akins : Oh yes, and you know, that\u2019s really where the framework originated and the rebuttal testimony. Like I said, it\u2019s in a critical part of the Wind Catcher timeline when you\u2019re in this time frame with the testimony done and being able to have those kinds of discussions, so. As far as confidence level is concerned, I\u2019m still very happy with the way this project looks, and even with tax reform, because a lot of times it gets hung up with what we call our ultra-low gas case, and it\u2019s not really even a gas case. It was really made up - we took our low gas case and we stress-tested the project at 50% of whatever those gas costs. It\u2019s far less than NYMEX is now, and so that\u2019s why I say a lot of the arguments are on the fringes, talking about things that really haven\u2019t happened. So if we can just get the dialog to where it\u2019s a reasonable type of discussion, then we\u2019ll be in good shape. You know, I testified in a case in Oklahoma in the 90s. There was a rail spur in the northeastern, and the commission--the Oklahoma commission approved that and we got capital recovery on the project, but it benefited in terms of fuel costs. This is no different. Matter of fact, we\u2019ve got more customer protection mechanisms in a rebuttal than we ever had anything like that, so when you look at what\u2019s going on in this case, we have stepped up to provide answers to the concerns that the interveners have had, and again caveated by--they certainly recommended rejection, but at the same time they said, okay, let\u2019s work on these customer protection mechanisms, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve done. Steve Fleishman : Great, thank you. Operator : Next we\u2019ll go to the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Julien Demoulin-Smith: Hey, good morning. Nicholas Akins : Good morning, how are you doing? Julien Demoulin-Smith: Good, thank you very much. Let me follow up on Steve\u2019s question just a quick bit, because I want to understand a little bit around the compartmentalization of Wind Catcher to the extent to which should one piece or another fall away as part of the approval process, can you ultimately move forward with this under a smaller context, or perhaps just under the wind or the transmission piece? Just want to frame the risk of the project moving forward again as you work through the settlement, and obviously I don\u2019t want to necessarily prejudge anything with respect to the settlement either. I obviously heard what you just said. Nicholas Akins : I\u2019m with you on that - let\u2019s don\u2019t prejudge it. But I would say that we\u2019re certainly expecting all the states to give approval to it. You can\u2019t really re-size this project. The benefit of this project is its size, its proximity, where it\u2019s located in western Oklahoma with high capacity factor wind, and with the transmission sized accordingly to serve that capacity, I think you\u2019re getting maximum benefit in terms of the value proposition to customers. I\u2019d have to say--you know, we\u2019re just going to have look and see what outcomes. We\u2019re expecting all states to approve it. If all states don\u2019t approve it, then we\u2019ll just have to look at it at the time, because I think there may be other takers out there that might be interested, so we\u2019ll see. But I really think that as we go forward, it will be pretty important for us to take a hard look at that project and understanding the benefits of that project, we\u2019ll make a determination whether we move forward or not, based upon the way the jurisdictions respond. That\u2019s really probably all we need to say at this point, because we want to make this project moves ahead. Now that being said, I will say that we are not going to move forward with a project that we don\u2019t feel like is beneficial not only to our customers - obviously it\u2019s beneficial to our customer, but our shareholders have to benefit as well, and we have a lot of places we can put our capital, and we just need to make sure it\u2019s done--as I mentioned earlier in my opening, the allocation of capital is going to be extremely important for us to focus in and prioritize our investments to ensure we meet our financial objectives. Wind Catcher is only a part of that - actually, it\u2019s incremental to the entire plan that we have today, and we\u2019re going to make sure it stands on its own merits.  So that being said, I\u2019m still confident. Julien Demoulin-Smith: Got it, excellent. Going back to a little bit more detail on the prior conversation around the impact of tax reform and flowing that back into the state, regulatory commission processes, can you give us a little bit of a sense on how you\u2019re thinking about that across the various states? I mean, there\u2019s a number of ways that you could presumably approach this in terms of both addressing perhaps unrecovered items, accelerating investment, returning benefits to customers, etc. Maybe a little bit of a flavor as you think about the various states. Nicholas Akins : Yes, it\u2019s an all-of-the-above type of thing, because state jurisdictions are going to look at it differently based upon their own individual situations. Kentucky already took advantage of part of it. We also have areas where we can accelerate depreciation or adjust plant balances or those types of things, so I think it\u2019s particularly important for us to be mindful of where each individual jurisdiction, where the touch points are, and be able to address that. Now, I think that obviously lowering rates to customers is a critical component of this, but at the same time there are distinct opportunities that we\u2019ve had discussions with commissions about previously that we could take advantage of and really have a real positive outcome for not only the customers but also in terms of ensuring that we\u2019re moving ahead in a positive way, whether that\u2019s capital investment to focus on the customer experience, whether it\u2019s certainly things we can do with plant balances to accelerate depreciation and so forth. So all those are things to be discussed, and we\u2019ll have--I really believe we\u2019ll have reasonable outcomes from a commission perspective, and we\u2019ll go forward. Julien Demoulin-Smith: Excellent, thank you very much. Operator : Next we\u2019ll go to the line of Praful Mehta with Citigroup. Your line is open. Praful Mehta : Thanks so much, hi guys. Nicholas Akins : Good morning. Praful Mehta : Morning. So just on tax reform, wanted to dig into one other topic on it. Looking at your EEI slides and the drop relative to that in your cash flow from operations for \u201918 and \u201919 is about $700 million to $800 million, wanted to understand what are the buckets that are driving that drop? Is it one of the bonus depreciation to makers, is it the revenue requirement coming down? Just wanted to understand what are the buckets that are driving it, and if there are any that can move as a result of all the negotiations that you\u2019re talking about right now. Brian Tierney : The part that moves as a part of the negotiations is really the billion or so of excess ADIT, and what we\u2019ve shown in the slide in the deck on Page 36 is what we believe is a conservative allotment of that. I\u2019m not going to go into what it is specifically, but we believe we\u2019ve been conservative as what that excess ADIT flow-back will be. Everything else, the numbers kind of work out the way they work out. Of course, we\u2019re going to be a lower taxpayer than what we thought, we\u2019re going to have PTCs and investment tax credits included in those numbers that will also impact making us much less of a taxpayer than we were, but in terms of risk, it\u2019s about a billion dollars of excess ADIT, and as Nick was describing, there are going to be thoughtful negotiations going on across all of our jurisdictions as to what\u2019s the best way to have that have an impact for our customers. Praful Mehta : Got it, so from a rating agency perspective, the drop--given you had accretion, I guess, going in, in terms of your FFO to debt, there is not a requirement to do anything at the back end given your metrics are improving by the back end, and you already had cushion, is that the way to think about the FFO to debt going forward? Brian Tierney : That\u2019s right. Praful, we were starting in a position of strength relative to our credit metrics against our ratings, and the reason we were in that position of strength was we anticipated being taxpayers in 2020 and we described that to rating agencies and investors. People understood that those metrics were going to deteriorate over time, but still stay within the metrics that are appropriate for our current ratings. Now that we\u2019re not going to be a big taxpayer but our cash metrics are going to come in line with our ratings over time, and we don\u2019t think that will be an issue for the rating agencies and we don\u2019t think it will have an impact on our ratings. Praful Mehta : Got you, fair enough. Finally just in terms of load growth, again in the EEI deck you had load growth of, I think for 2018, 0.7%, which is now down to 0.2% for 2018. I know you touched on this earlier as well with, I think, Greg\u2019s question, but just wanted to get any more color on what led to the drop in \u201918, anything we should be focused on, and is that \u201918 number more of a steady state, do you think? Brian Tierney : Yes, so our numbers for \u201918 essentially stayed the same. The fourth quarter of \u201917 came in stronger than what we thought it was going to be, so the adjustment means less of an increase in \u201918 even though our numbers in \u201918 stayed about the same. Does that make sense? Nicholas Akins : It\u2019s just a (indiscernible) point of reference. Praful Mehta : Yes, got it, that makes sense. Thanks so much, guys. Appreciate it. Brian Tierney : Thanks Praful. Operator : Next we\u2019ll go to the line of Christopher Turnure with JP Morgan. Your line is open. Nicholas Akins : Morning Christopher. Christopher Turnure : Morning, Brian and Nick. I wanted to see if you guys were prepared to clarify the 5 to 7% growth. My understanding is previously it was off a 365 base in 2017 and went through 2019. Is that the same way that we should think about it now? Brian Tierney : I think we had given detail around that going out even a year farther than that, but we don\u2019t anticipate any change to that in even years beyond that, so we see a runway for that out as far as we can see in our forecasts. We\u2019ve given detail around that out through 2020. Christopher Turnure : In 2020 at least, could we consider 5 to 7% to be an annual growth rate as opposed to a CAGR off of a previous base? Brian Tierney : You know, it\u2019s an earnings growth rate, Christopher, so say it\u2019s off 365. As we go forward, we don\u2019t see that changing as \u201916 came in more or less than what we had forecast. Christopher Turnure : Okay, fair enough. Then there is a lot of jurisdictions here to deal with as it relates to tax reform, and a couple of previous questions have touched on this already, but we have you guys reiterating the 5 to 7% long term rate, we also have a $700 million to $800 million decrease in your forecasted operating cash flow versus EEI, as would be expected here. Is it fair to characterize your assumptions as they relate to tax reform as conservative as they pertain both to the DTL revaluation as well as just the refund considerations to customers themselves? Brian Tierney : Yes, so let me clarify that a little bit. We do assume that we are going to the lower tax rate from the 35% down to 21%, and that that will be a fairly direct pass-through to our customers in terms of rate since that 35% was baked into our rates and now 21% will be, so we view that as not being an earnings issue. Similarly with the excess ADIT issue - it\u2019s a matter of how do we flow that cash back to our customers and over what period of time. In 1986, it ranged from two years, I think, to 20 years depending on jurisdiction, and I think we\u2019ll have an equally large spread of jurisdictions depending on each jurisdiction\u2019s particular interest, so both of those we have reflected in our numbers, but both of those tend not to be earnings issues, they tend to be, as you were pointing out, cash issues. Christopher Turnure : Okay, and just on that front, to hit the 5 to 7% growth rate because cash will eventually impact earnings at some point, you don\u2019t need to hit any certain targets in certain jurisdictions to delay that refund or get some kind of reg asset taken off your balance sheet or anything? You feel that you can reach that level with the refunds happening essentially right away? Brian Tierney : Well again, we did not assume right away, we certainly don\u2019t assume day one flow-backs, and we don\u2019t think that would be a reasonable answer for jurisdictions to ask from us. We\u2019ve built these ADIT balances up over the last 10 or so years, and a flow-back period that is in that time range, we think would be reasonable, or a flow-back that would be associated with the life of an asset would be reasonable. Nicholas Akins : It wouldn\u2019t make any sense for the regulatory commissions to ask for all the cash back immediately, because that would impact the credit metrics of each individual entity, and historically it hasn\u2019t been dealt with that way. Back in the 80s when this occurred, it was amortized over time and we would fully expect the same thing this time around. Christopher Turnure : Okay, I didn\u2019t necessarily mean just with the deferred tax liability going back on that, just the lower tax rate itself. Brian Tierney : Yes, so we assume that flows through to customers pretty directly. Nicholas Akins : The other thing I just want to reiterate too is that through all this, if there is any question of the 5 to 7% growth rate being in jeopardy in some fashion, that\u2019s just not the case. We\u2019re looking at the 5 to 7% growth rate just like we looked at it before, and luckily--well, not just luckily, but certainly we\u2019re in the enviable position to be able to adjust to tax reform and still confidently talk about our 5 to 7% growth rate. Christopher Turnure : Understood, thank you guys. Operator : Next we\u2019ll go to the line of Ali Agha with SunTrust. Your line is open. Ali Agha : Thank you, good morning. Nicholas Akins : Morning Ali. Ali Agha : Nick or Brian, on the Wind Catcher project, there has been some rumblings in the past that maybe a competing transmission line may complicate the overall project. Can you talk to that - is that a concern? Nicholas Akins : We don\u2019t see that. I mean, other projects will have to stand on their own merits, just like our project. Our project is unique in that it does originate in western Oklahoma high capacity wind, but we also terminate it at where the load is in our territory, and that\u2019s toward Tulsa. I think the other projects have different routings and different assumptions associated with them and congestion associated with them, different assumptions entirely. So there may be opportunities to look at right-of-ways and some element of consistency, but other than that, though, there is really--they\u2019re just different. They\u2019re originating different, the takers are different, and so I would say there\u2019s plenty of wind in Oklahoma, there\u2019s plenty of opportunity for development, and there\u2019s plenty of ability to continue to move that process forward. The pie is big enough for more than our particular transaction, so more power to them, but more power to us as well. Ali Agha : Okay. Also, as you\u2019re looking at the project and assuming it gets approved and everything, is the plan still to own 100% of this or is there a scenario where you could sell down a piece to a third party or reduce that ownership? Nicholas Akins : No, we intend on owning 100%. Ali Agha : I see, okay. More near term, I remember when you laid out your \u201918 guidance for us back at EEI, it was assumed in there a certain amount of rate increases from the various rate cases that had been going on and still going on. Can you just remind us what percentage of that has currently been locked in? Brian Tierney : About 50%, Ali. Ali Agha : Fifty percent - okay. Last question, Brian, just a clarification, so the 5 to 7% growth rate, you are still basing that off an implied 365 number for \u201917, and I heard you say it will go beyond 2020 as well. But again, should we assume that\u2019s kind of an annual growth, or we should again assume it\u2019s cumulative and could move around within years? Brian Tierney : It\u2019s a growth rate. It will move around within years, but the growth rate is 5 to 7%. Ali Agha : And off a 365 base for \u201917? Brian Tierney : Yes. Ali Agha : Okay, thank you. Nicholas Akins : Now just keep in mind, as I said earlier, that if we get Wind Catcher and other things that we\u2019ve talked about during EEI Financial, then that can certainly be helpful; but overall, we\u2019re looking at 5 to 7%. We\u2019re within that range and nominally when we look at it, you can look at that range and we\u2019re going to be consistent. That\u2019s what we\u2019re about, that\u2019s what we do. Ali Agha : Understood, thank you. Betty Jo Rozsa : Operator, we have time for one more question. Operator : Certainly. Last, we\u2019ll go to the line of Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Stephen Byrd : Good morning. Thanks for all the disclosure, it\u2019s been helpful. Most of my questions have been addressed. I guess just stepping back at a high level and thinking about your growth drivers, I do see a couple positives. I guess the rate base CAGR is going up, you\u2019ve had some good results on the pension side as well, and I know you have to raise your debt financing a bit, but that\u2019s certainly an accretive use of money in terms of the rate base CAGR. So I guess I see a few positives - you know, Oklahoma is an unknown and certainly potentially concerning, but I respect your perspective on that. At a very big picture drivers--I guess there is often confusion between cash and GAAP and real earnings power here. I just want to make sure I\u2019m thinking about high level drivers correctly. Brian Tierney : Stephen, you\u2019re thinking about it right. When we talk about 5 to 7% growth rate, we\u2019re basing that off an increase in net plant and then getting that reflected in rates, and even at EEI we talked about there being somewhat of a lag associated with the investment we\u2019ve put into place and then having that reflected in rates. That\u2019s least in our transmission business because of the formula-based annual true-ups that they have in the rate base. But really, that 5 to 7% growth rate is based on our continuing to put investment in the ground for the benefit of our customers than getting that reflected in rates, and that has--what we\u2019ve been able to do even with what\u2019s happened with bonus depreciation, with the reduction in the ADIT and the reduction in cash flows, we\u2019ve still been able to keep that investment essentially unchanged. We change at $500 million in the third year of our forecast, but by being able to keep that investment essentially the same, that allows us to stay in that growth range. Nicholas Akins : I think you have to look at the overall message of AEP has been consistent for years now, but it continues to even be augmented beyond that. This is a very, very solid, financially sound utility that is doing smart things for our customers and working with our jurisdictions, but it\u2019s obviously accentuated by the largest transmission system in the country and the fact that we are making our own version of an adjustment in the fleet itself, and that\u2019s why you have the Wind Catcher and you have other wind power projects, you\u2019re having other transitions occur from a resource standpoint. So the augmentation of that along with what\u2019s going on, on the distribution side - you know, we talked about $500 million of additional incremental investments to be made in distribution on grid modernization that\u2019s not in the plan, these are all things that are changing as time goes on, and when you see the adoption of electric vehicles and all those things that are occurring, there is some important catalysts that we\u2019re seeing in the future that we plan on taking advantage of. Stephen Byrd : That\u2019s a great overview. Thanks very much, that\u2019s all I had. Betty Jo Rozsa : Thank you everyone for joining us on today\u2019s call. As always, the IR team will be available to answer any additional questions you may have. Tawanda, would you please give the replay information? Operator : Certainly.

I would now like to turn the conference over to Bette Jo Rozsa. Please go ahead. Bette Jo Rozsa - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Thank you, Lea. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the first quarter 2018 earnings call for American Electric Power. We appreciate your taking the time to join us today. Our earnings release, presentation slides and related financial information are available on our website at aep.com. Today, we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors. Our presentation also includes references to non-GAAP financial information. Please refer to the reconciliation of the applicable GAAP measures provided in the appendix of today's presentation. Joining me this morning for opening remarks are Nick Akins, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Tierney, our Chief Financial Officer. We will take your questions following their remarks. I will now turn the call over to Nick. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Thanks, Bette Jo. Good morning, everyone, and welcome again to AEP's first quarter 2018 earnings call. We were very happy to get out of 2017 in a respectable fashion with one of the mildest years on record, but still delivering results within our guidance range for the year. We're off to a much more normal start in 2018 financially with more normal weather buoyed by what appears to be a resurgent economy. In fact, AEP service territory economy and load performance is as strong as it has been in years. Unemployment rates are the lowest since 2000 and retail sales are up in all classes, all companies, and actually in all 10 sectors of the economy, which hasn't happened since 2011. With that said, because of O&M timing and this return to normal levels after a year of reductions due to weather, our results for the quarter were on par with expectations in achieving our stated guidance range for the year of $3.75 to $3.95 per share, which we are reaffirming. The first quarter 2018 EPS came in at $0.92 per share GAAP and $0.96 per share operating versus a $1.20 per share GAAP and $0.96 per share operating respectively in 2017. So, overall, a good quarter and start for the year. Looking deeper into the quarter, and Brian will cover this in more detail, fundamentally, we are in better shape than in the first quarter of last year given this has been a busy quarter of rate case outcomes that set the tone for the future. I'll get into the rate case outcomes in a minute, but first I want to say thank you to our employees who worked so hard in the recovery efforts after last year's hurricanes; hurricanes Harvey in Texas, Irma in Florida, and Irma and Maria in Puerto Rico. Our last employees have returned from Puerto Rico and I'm so proud of their accomplishments in very severe conditions. In our business, they are our heroes. Now, let's talk about some activities of interest here in this quarter. Wind Catcher is finally feeling some tailwinds. We have accomplished important settlements in Arkansas, Louisiana, and now Oklahoma with the industrials and Walmart that provides the framework for the various commissions to bless this significant project and its benefits for our customers. We are continuing to try to bring other parties in Oklahoma, such as the Oklahoma staff on the settlement agreement and are continuing our efforts in Texas to achieve a settlement as well. We have taken on manageable risk intended to recognize market expectations relative to regulated wind projects and have worked hard to mitigate these risks in the background with engineering, construction, and operational strategies. We are confident in our ability to deliver the expected benefits to our customers and shareholders and look forward to obtaining Commission approvals so that we can move forward as quickly as possible. We are now awaiting Commission orders in Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana and Texas and expecting orders in the May and June timeframe. Regarding Ohio, we just received an order yesterday. We're pleased that the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio approved the settlement for the most part in the Ohio ESP case. Not only do we now have an ESP that is effective through 2024, which certainly brings an important element of stability, it also preserves the continuation of the Distribution Investment Rider at the settlement agreement level and a 10% ROE. The order also supports future opportunities through the smart city initiative and the Renewable Generation Rider. These components really look to the future as a vision by Chairman, Asim Haque's PowerForward initiative. AEP stands ready to support the PUCO in this important endeavor. Additionally, the Columbus Smart City initiative has taken a major step forward in providing societal benefits of electrification, EV adoption, distributed resources, smart street lighting and other benefits that will define the future for Columbus and the nation. This order also preserves our ability to collect for OVEC subject to certain transmission-related limitations through 2024. All in all, a good order, brings stability and certainty to future benefits that will support AEP's drive to improve the customer experience. Several other rate case outcomes have produced positive results. In Indiana, I&M has a settlement agreement filed and we anticipate a July effective date of a net revenue increase of $97 million, which includes tax reform adjustments and 9.95% approved ROE. In Michigan, in order effective this month with a revenue increase of $49 million and a 9.9% authorized ROE has been completed. In Kentucky, a 9.7% authorized ROE and a net revenue of $16 million, adjusted for tax reform, was effective in January of this quarter. SWEPCO Texas increased \u2013 their increase of $50 million and 9.6% ROE that was approved and retroactively applied to May of last year. In Oklahoma, which is our only significant rate case disappointment with only a 9.3% authorized ROE and $76 million net revenue adjusted for tax reform was effective in March. And speaking of tax reform, the adjustment for tax reform in the Oklahoma case assumed that the authorized ROE versus the actual ROE of 5.2%, that cost PSO another $15 million. So, we have some work to do to try to clarify some of that activity. Brian will be discussing tax reform itself in more detail in a couple of minutes. Because PSO's effective ROE is only 5.2% we're evaluating our options regarding cost control and additional rate case activity. Regarding the FERC 206 transmission cases, in the East, we filed with FERC a settlement with several of the parties that resolves all issues set for hearing. The settlement agreed to have base ROE of 9.8% subject to a cap and common equity of 55%. With the RTO adder of 50 basis points, the effective ROE will be 10.3% and we will adjust our 50/50 cash structure to reflect the 55% equity layer. Interim rate changes reflecting these settlement parameters were filed with for PJM earlier this month. We await a final order from FERC as we bring certainty to our transmission-related investments in the East. Where AEP has much less exposure in the West, settlement discussions have stalled. We stand ready for further discussions, but this may likely go to hearing for a resolution to occur. So as you move to the equalizer chart this time around, many of these many of these companies we've already covered so this will be a sort of a shorter version. But overall, our regulated ROEs are 9.5%, which it was 9.5% last quarter. We generally target the 10% range. And as you know, we have currently five rate cases that are completed. So, we expect these ROEs to continue to improve across the board. Regarding AEP Ohio, the ROE for AEP Ohio at the end of the first quarter was 13.7%, but that includes issues that are actually excluded for evaluation of the SEET. And also, the SEET-adjusted ROE is 9.5%. As you recall, they have some legacy issues that are excluded from the calculation such as the RSR, some fuel-related activities, and 2014 SEET refund. So, the effective return is 9.5%. And those legacy items generally roll off at the end of the year. So, hopefully, we'll be able to merge those two bubbles into something that makes sense later on. APCo, APCo at the end of the first quarter was 9.2%. APCo's improvement in ROE over the fourth quarter of 2017 is primarily weather. Just a note, the Virginia Legislature passed legislation establishing triennial rate reviews, and APCo's first triennial review will be in 2020 and will cover the 2017 to 2019 period. So, we have a little work to do there. And then West Virginia, we intend on following a rate case in May in that jurisdiction. I already covered Kentucky, but just wanted to mention to you that we do have a couple of large aluminum company and a battery storage manufacturer located there, and that's part of our long-term strategy around improvements in the ROEs in Kentucky. Certainly, the economic development part of that is very important. As far as I&M, I already covered both of those. PSO, I think we've talked about enough. SWEPCO continues to have the effect of not only the Turk 88 megawatts, which we'll have to deal with in the future, but also they lost some wholesale contract load that went off at the first of the year. So, that was an impact for them. But we expect them to move up just a little bit as form of (10:16) base rates and other mechanisms come into place in the retail jurisdictions. AEP Texas, the ROE for AEP Texas at the end of the first quarter 2018 was 10.1% versus 10% last quarter. AEP Texas, their steady ROE is primarily attributable to favorable regulatory treatment in Texas with the ability to file an annual DCRF and TCOS filings. AEP Transmission Holdco continues to do well. At the end of the first quarter, it was 12.9% and it's slightly better than the fourth quarter due to benefits from tax reform and some timing matters. So, generally, while it looks like there's a trough there, we fully expect that to continue to improve with the rate case outcomes that we've put in place. So, this has been a normal quarter financially, but an outstanding quarter overall from an execution standpoint that sets the tone for 2018 and beyond with several rate case outcomes and settlements regarding Wind Catcher behind us, as Rush's classic rock song, Red Barchetta, which \u2013 Red Barchetta is a car, it's a two-seater Italian car \u2013 would say it's time to strip away the old debris, fire up the shiny Red Barchetta and respond with a roar. That's what I see in the excitement, the energy of our teams of employees at this company working on projects such as Wind Catcher and other technology advancements that will change the face of AEP's interaction with our customers. To paraphrase one of the latest Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductees, Bon Jovi, and I know this phrase will stick with you the rest of the day, we're halfway there, living on a prayer, take our hand and we'll make it, we swear. So, enjoy the ride with American Electric Power. Brian? Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Thank you, Nick, and good morning, everyone. I'll take us through the financial results for the quarter, provide some insight on load and the economy, review our balance sheet and liquidity, and finish with an update on tax reform. Let's begin on slide 6, which shows that operating earnings for the first quarter were $0.96 per share or $473 million, comparable to last year's results. All of our regulated segments experienced growth for the quarter. And as expected, our competitive Generation & Marketing business was down due to last year's asset sales. Looking at the drivers by segment, earnings for the Vertically-Integrated Utilities were $0.47 per share, up $0.02. Most of the $0.12 increase in weather was driven by the warm 2017 winter. Rate changes were also favorable due to the recovery of incremental investment across multiple jurisdictions. Offsetting these favorable items were anticipated decreases in our wholesale load as well as increased O&M and depreciation expenses. The Transmission & Distribution Utilities segment earned $0.25 per share, up a penny from last year. Favorable drivers in this segment included higher normalized load, weather and rate changes, each contributing a penny. Partially offsetting these favorable items were higher O&M and depreciation expenses. The AEP Transmission Holdco segment continued to grow, contributing $0.21 per share, an improvement of $0.07 from last year. This growth in earnings reflected our return on incremental rate base as well as other items, including a true-up for the FERC 206 settlement and other small non-recurring items. Our investment in this segment grew by $1.7 billion since last March. Generation & Marketing produced earnings of $0.08 per share, down $0.06 from last year, primarily due to the sale of assets. Finally, Corporate and Other was down $0.04 per share from last year due to higher interest and O&M expenses and a prior-year investment gain. Overall, we experienced a solid quarter and are confident in reaffirming our annual operating earnings guidance. Now, let's turn to slide 7 for an update on normalized load growth. Starting in the lower-right chart, our normalized retail sales increased by 1.5%, which is similar to last quarter. For the first time since 2011, we experienced normalized load growth across all three major retail classes. Moving clockwise, industrial sales increased by 2.5% for the quarter. Each of our top 10 industrial sectors reported growth versus last year for the first time in years. Sectors that posted the strongest growth this quarter were pipeline transportation, oil and gas extraction and primary metals. The impact of tax reform, higher energy prices and a stronger global economy, as well as a weaker dollar, have all combined to create a positive environment for industrial sales. In the upper-left chart, normalized residential sales were up 1.4% for the quarter. The chart shows improvement in residential sales over the past year. The growth is spread across both the Vertically-Integrated and T&D Utilities segments. Customer accounts were up 0.5% compared to last year, which is the strongest we've seen since 2015. Weather-normalized usage was also up 0.9% this quarter, and has correlated with the recent improvement in incomes, which I'll discuss in more detail on the next slide. Finally, in the upper-right chart, commercial sales for the quarter increased by 0.5%. This is the first time since 2016 that our commercial class reported growth, which was largely concentrated in Ohio and our Western service territory. We continue to expect modest gains in commercial sales in 2018. Now, let's move to slide 8 and review the status of our regional economies. As shown in the upper-left chart, GDP growth in AEP service territory exceeded the U.S. by 0.4% in the first quarter. In fact, the economy in AEP service territory has been growing at a faster pace than the U.S. for the past year. The upper-right chart shows that employment growth in AEP service territory continues to close in on that of the U.S. For the quarter, job growth in AEP service territory was at 1.1% with higher growth in our Western territory than our Eastern. And while employment growth has continued to improve, unemployment rates in our footprint are at their lowest level since 2000. The bottom chart on this page shows growth in personal income. In the first quarter, income growth within AEP service area was 0.7% greater than the U.S. Rising customer incomes was a key driver for the increase in residential sales. Now, let's move to slide 9 and review the company's capitalization and liquidity. Our debt to total capital ratio increased 1.1% during the quarter to 56.6%. Our FFO to debt ratio was solidly in the Baa1 range at 18.2% and our net liquidity stood at about $1.3 billion supported by our revolving credit facility. Our qualified pension funding improved to 102% and our OPEB funding improved to 131%. For both plans, the funded status improved due to rising interest rates, driving a decrease in liabilities that more than offset asset losses. Let's turn to slide 10, and I will update the tax reform information that I provided earlier in the year. In regards to the change in the statutory corporate rate, we either have regulatory orders in place or filed settlements to reflect a lower rate in Indiana, Kentucky, Oklahoma and FERC Transmission for our Eastern states. In our remaining regulated jurisdictions, we are deferring the difference between the old and new rate for future adjustment. Trackers and formula rate filings will accommodate this change in Louisiana, AEP Texas and Ohio. We have updated the slide to show that as of March 31, we have approximately $1 billion of excess deferred income tax, which is not associated with depreciable assets and will flow back to customers at a tenor set by each jurisdiction. Options for passing this benefit to customers include decreasing rates for some period of time, increasing the amortization of regulatory assets, accelerating depreciation and offsetting items that would otherwise increase rates. We have addressed this issue in our Indiana and East FERC Transmission settlements and are working with our remaining jurisdictions to determine the best resolution. As we discussed in January, we reduced our 2020 capital expenditures by $500 million to support our FFO to debt ratio, and we reiterated our equity plans which we anticipate raising $100 million in 2018 and 2019 and $500 million in 2020. As a reminder, this plan does not include provisions for Wind Catcher. In addition to this slide, there is more detail on slide 23 of the presentation. Let's try and wrap this up on slide 11 so we can get to your questions. We will finalize our pending rate cases, obtain clarity on the Wind Catcher project, and continue working with regulators to provide the best solution for customers regarding tax reform. Our performance in the first quarter and the stability of our regulated business model gives us the confidence to reaffirm our operating earnings guidance range of $3.75 to $3.95 per share. With that, I will turn the call over to the operator for your questions. Operator : Thank you. Our first question is from the line of Greg Gordon with Evercore. Please go ahead. Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Good morning, Greg. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Good morning, guys. Several questions for you. I'll try to make them brief. First is congrats on the Wind Catcher settlement in Oklahoma. You have a couple parties on board, but you have many more that have not officially signed on. But can you give us some color around the negotiations there? And what, on the margin, you have conceded to give up in this settlement to give customer protections versus the prior deal? And what it might take to get more parties on board? Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Yeah, Greg. Obviously, a great question. We continue to try to get other parties on board. But as we said from the beginning, it was extremely important to get the industrials on board in Oklahoma. And I think by getting them on board, it certainly sets the predicate for the opportunity for the commissioners themselves to look at this and say, okay, we've got both the industrial customers and Walmart, and the customers have spoken. Now, there are other parties, as you mentioned. And certainly, we're trying to get the Oklahoma staff engaged in this process and, certainly, the Attorney General \u2013 probably not likely to get the Attorney General on board. But others will continue to be open to that, including the Attorney General. But at this point, though, I think it's framed up pretty well, because a lot of work's been done in the background. Our people have been working tirelessly with all these parties around the various jurisdictions to try to drive some consistency around what the risks were being taken. And a lot of it centered on the 10-year look-backs, the performance guarantees, certainly the force majeure-related provisions as well. And it really \u2013 as we looked at it, and as I mentioned early on in our discussion, you have to \u2013 if you're going to do regulated renewables, then certainly we'll have to meet the market on what risks are being taken relative to regulated renewable investments. And we looked at it, looked at it in a lot of detail. We have a lot of, like \u2013 as I mentioned earlier, engineering and construction. We looked that in detail, the operational characteristics of particularly the generation tie (22:16), and we've come a long way in terms of the evaluation of those risks. We were willing to take it, and the industrials were ultimately supportive. So, I think it just sets the tone for continued discussions. But as far as I'm concerned, we've put it in a very good place, and you'll note that those provisions are pretty consistent with the settlements that have been done previously by SPS over in New Mexico and Texas. And we're having discussions with the Texas parties now. So, you're starting to see, in my opinion, a coalition around what risk parameters, what the framework of a deal looks like, and I see that momentum gaining. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Well. Good luck with that. I think that's great. Two more questions. One is on when you look at the equalizer chart, in Oklahoma, I know PSO on a trailing 12 only earned 5.2% and the rate decision you've got there wasn't great, but it was better than the skinny deals that Oklahoma traditionally gives. So if we were to extrapolate out 12 months, we would still expect PSO's ROEs to improve dramatically, maybe if not towards your best case aspiration. Is that fair? Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Well, the odd part about it is, if Wind Catcher gets approved, ultimately it's going to help the ROE overall because PSO has a really small rate base. I mean, essentially, no generation's been built there for quite a period of time. So you're really dealing with a large company that \u2013 with a lot of PPAs for generation. So, the rate base itself has dwindled to really pretty small. I mean it's less than 5% of the earnings of the corporation. And so, when you think about where PSO is heading, if Oklahoma really wants to develop infrastructure around these types of assets, energy assets, to take advantage of wind power, natural gas, certainly indigenous sources for that territory, we're going to have to see positive signals on those types of investments. And they really do need to fix the issue of recovering transmission cost as well on a timely basis. So, a lot of this rate lag type of activity, it took a long time for the last rate case and actually the rate case pretty much turned out to be very disappointing. I was really expecting more from the Oklahoma Commission from that perspective, but I think there were a lot of issues that were being dealt with there that, hopefully, next time we'll be able to get over and we will be following another rate case in Oklahoma. But certainly, the Wind Catcher approval is what we have our sights on right now. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Great. And my last question is on page 9, we look at the credit statistics, obviously, on a trailing basis here at 18.2% FFO. But tax reform really hadn't kicked in yet, and I know you said the target is the mid-teens. But all things being equal, if we look out 12 months, how much of a degradation in that FFO are we looking at? Is it a couple of hundred basis points? Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Brian. Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: We think it'll be 200 basis points to 300 basis points, Greg. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Okay. Thank you, guys. Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Yeah. Sure thing. Operator : Next, we go to the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Yeah. Hi. Good morning. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Good morning. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : So, speaking of living on a prayer, I have a few Wind Catcher question. Sorry. I couldn't help. You asked for that one. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: (26:31). Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Yeah. Thank you for the Rush references, those are great. So just if I recall back last fall, you had talked about wanting decisions by April to make sure that you would have it online to get the full PTCs. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Yeah. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Is May-June going to be okay to be able to capture full PTCs? Like, what is the real deadline? Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Yeah, we'll be fine. Really, we have to get to a point of getting these orders in place, and then we'll cover it with our board, obviously, in our July meeting. And then once they approve it, we're off and running. So if we get it in that June timeframe, we get the orders in the May to June timeframe, we'll be in good shape. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. And then just you're appropriately very focused on making sure you're not taking on risks that are not typical for regulated investment. Could you \u2013 and I know you just did this, but just when you look at the main risks that you're kind of protecting from, could you just clarify what those are? Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Yeah. I think certainly the 10-year look-back, because obviously the customers want to see a benefit, and we're convinced there will be a benefit. Now, that goes to the operations of the facilities. But the 10-year look-back obviously measures the benefits that customers see, and that analysis is based upon our existing generation. So, we feel pretty good about how that would work out. And then when you look at the force majeure provisions, those are really focused on \u2013 and you have to look at sort of the force majeure risk compared to the production guarantees, and the production guarantees are such that we really \u2013 and we looked at this operational from an engineering standpoint, and we feel like that there is risk mitigation associated with the production guarantees that enable us to take on more risk as it relates to force majeure. And then, obviously, that goes to the production guarantee, the capacity factor guarantee, and we feel very comfortable about that as well, because we've been in that territory for a long time. We know how to build transmission. We know how to run transmission. If a tornado came through, it could take down a couple of structures or whatever, but we're used to doing that, and we know the timeframe of doing that. And then for the facilities themselves, obviously, there's a multitude of \u2013 yeah, it really is pretty good from a diversity of standpoint. It's not like a central station generation facilities. It's a bunch of small generators sitting up on poles. And that really gives us an opportunity to mitigate risk on an aggregate standpoint from that perspective as well. So when we look at it, we are convinced that we're able to deliver the production guarantees, but also have the ability to adjust, if necessary. So, all in all, I'd say, the rewards at this point certainly outweigh the risks. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. Thank you. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Yes. Operator : Next, we go to the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Good morning, Jonathan. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey. Good morning, guys. The first question. I think, Brian, you mentioned that you had addressed the excess deferred tax in the Indiana and FERC East settlements. How much of the billion dollars does that speak to? Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Hold on a second, Greg (sic) [Jon] (30:50). About $100.25 million. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Jon. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks. And then I think you've given some guidance in the past as what timeframe you thought was a reasonable rule of thumb for this or what you'd seen in the 1986 case, any updated thoughts around that. Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Yeah. I think if you assume 10 years, you'll probably be at about the right place. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Perfect. Okay. Thank you. And then just on sales, Brian, I may have missed this. At one point, I think you said you were going to have a little additional commentary on the residential piece and the 1.4% in the first quarter, obviously, is bucking the trend. Do you have some follow-up comment on that, was weather normalization kind of tricky this quarter? Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: No, I think that's pretty much on track. The places where we're seeing it, though, Greg, is in the places where we're just T&D Utilities, so we're seeing it more in Texas and Ohio. And that's why you're not seeing as much uplift in revenue is because it's just in the places where we are wires only. It's mostly in the places where we're wires only so. So while we're encouraged by this given where it's coming from and the mix of those sales, we're not getting a huge amount of uplift in regards to net income because of that residential increase. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thanks very much, guys. Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Next, we go to the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Good morning, Julien. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey, good morning. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Good morning Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : So, perhaps, to turn the attention slightly differently here. I understand that you received your order in Ohio and you've got the ESP under control and out there. But to what ability is there to negotiate and address the tax issue still or is there a need to at this point? I just wanted to kind of come back to that. It seems like you largely addressed the issues there, but I just want to kind of come back to that given there's not an obvious venue to address that directly notwithstanding reopening these issues. So, I just want to understand. Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Specifically, Ohio? Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Yeah. He's talking about Ohio. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Exactly. Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Yeah. So, we have two avenues for addressing that. One is just the absolute change in rate which I think we can handle in DIR filings. But then also what the Commission has done is asked us as well as the other AEP utilities \u2013 the other Ohio utilities to come in and have a dialog with them about that. So, they've set up a hearing mechanism whereby all of the Ohio utilities will go in and have the dialog. And I think we'll be able to put together something that is compelling, and doesn't have to be litigious. I think we'll be able to settle that. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got it. Excellent. And then turning back to Wind Catcher real quickly, obviously, you're working every state front. To the extent to which, let's say, Texas and those negotiations aren't necessarily as fruitful here on the prescribed timeline that you just talked about, how confident are you about signing up alternatives like munis and co-ops just to be able to continue working on the project, notwithstanding clarity in Texas, shall we say? Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Julien, I really think we are going to get a result in Texas. And I think it'd be problematic during the pendency of something that's working to go sell somewhere else. So, we're feeling pretty good about the direction this all is taking and the timing of it. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got it. And maybe actually if you could clarify, I would suspect that the issues, they're largely the same as you just described a moment ago across the various states. Is there anything unique with respect to Texas? Obviously, the industrial interveners there have historically been fairly outspoken as well. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: No, I think as far as Texas is concerned, I mean the industrials in Texas, you have some of the people who represent the same people, but I think you've got certainly different industrials with different thought processes. But when you think about the settlement that was done with SPS and how it compares against what, certainly what we've done relative to the Oklahoma industrials, it's pretty much the same. And SPS settled with all the parties in Texas. So I think we have an opportunity. We knew going into this thing that with four states, there'd be some commonality in that. In fact, the four states have, in most cases, most favored nations and that kind of thing. So, they're all watching each other in terms of the result. And we have a result in Oklahoma and in the other jurisdictions there that is consistent with what is happening in Texas at this point. And I think we're in good shape. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : All right. Excellent. Well, best of luck. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Yes. Thank you. Operator : Next, we go to a line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Good morning. Can you hear me? Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Good morning, Paul. Yes, I can hear you. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Two questions. Is there a statutory deadline in any of the Wind Catcher states, when this has to be done by? Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: I don't think there's a statutory deadline, but certainly there's a business deadline. I mean, we've been very transparent about the timing necessary and the procedural schedules have been set up consistent with getting a decision on time. So, I think it's really more driven by, I guess, one of the previous questions sort of brought out, when is our drop-dead date and that kind of thing. But I can just tell you that May and June fits. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: And then some of the concessions you've made are around cost caps. Who's wearing that risk? Is it you or the contractors? Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Yeah. It's both. We have fixed-price contracts with the appropriate contingencies. And I think that that risk is being shared. And actually, this tells you a little bit about the commitment of the suppliers that we're working with. I mean, these are established suppliers that do a lot of business that we do a lot of business with. And I can guarantee a lot of homework's been done on what these operational provisions will look like, what the construction side will look like, what the supply will look like, what risks are being borne. And also even if route changes were to occur on the generation tie (38:02) that those have been discussed and (38:05) as well. So, we feel very good about where our suppliers sit at this point. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: We're not building nuclear plants here, right? Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: We're not building nuclear plants. Well, I wouldn't want to trash nuclear or anything, because I'm supportive of nuclear. But this is putting small generators up on poles and putting transmission structures up and lines up, and we do that all the time. And 765, we do that all the time. And so, this is not something that is a first \u2013 like stamp number one. And the other thing, too, is that when we look at this entire project, it is definitely important to AEP because it represents what we're capable of doing. And when you introduce 765-kV in that part of the country, it could be a tremendous benefit in the future, not just from an economic development standpoint, but also in terms of our ability to continue to serve our customers and serve them well. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Then one last question, and if you addressed this, I'll circle back with Bette Jo. But transmission was very strong in the quarter. What was driving that? Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: So, there were some \u2013 there was obviously the FERC 206 settlement was a contributor to that. But tax reform also contributed to that in that the rate base goes up higher with the ADIT not going into rates. So, those two factors mainly contributed to that increase. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Is this kind of \u2013 did all of this hit in the first quarter, or are we going to continue to see those, at least on the tax reform, flow through the year? Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: We expect an uplift of about $0.04 versus what we'd shown you at EEI over the course of the whole year, $0.04 to $0.05. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thank you very much. Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Yes. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Sure thing, Paul. Operator : Next, we go to the line of Praful Mehta with Citi. Please go ahead. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks so much. Hi, guys. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Good morning, Praful. How are you doing? Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Good. How are you? Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Just fine. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Excellent. So, quickly just on the deferred income taxes, on the unprotected one, I think, Brian, you mentioned 10 years as a possible assumption for refund. We've also heard from other utilities who are paying it back a lot sooner. So just want to understand, is that mostly an assumption of a negotiation or is that a preference from your end to kind of draw it out over a longer period because there are benefits to kind of growing rate base as you kind of refund it back as well? Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Yes. So, you're going to see everything from much quicker than that to much slower than that across our 11 jurisdictions. And so, the data point that I have is what we were able to do in Indiana where we were able to increase the depreciation on some of our coal units there and have that be the factor by which we flow back the excess, and that was a 10-year period. So if you're modeling something across the system, I think 10 years would be a pretty good assumption. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Got you. And your preference is not to do it sooner as well, just to understand from a preference perspective? Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Our preference really is kind of do it on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis, right? And when we talk about taking down reg assets, when we talk about fuel, when we talk about other things that are going to increase rates, it's really going to be jurisdiction by jurisdiction as to what the best way for those customers is for them to receive that benefit. And we're going to work with interveners and commissions and try and be as constructive as we possibly can on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Got you. Fair enough. That's helpful. And then just quickly, just strategically, more from a corporate M&A perspective, the conversation has increased a little bit given tax reforms behind. And it also looks like companies who are better positioned, like yourselves with stronger credit going into tax reform have a competitive advantage. Do you see that at all? Do you see any dialog increasing, and how are you looking at strategic M&A at this point? Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: So, let me just address the financial aspect of it, and I'll Nick address the strategic aspect of it. So when we're looking at our balance sheet, you look at our credit metrics and they are very healthy now. We do expect them to go back into the normal range for Baa1 rated company due to the impact of tax reform. So, we're very strong right now. We had anticipated being a tax payer. That's gone away, to a large degree, with the impact of tax reform, Wind Catcher and other such things. But because of the impacts of tax reform, we do anticipate, as we talked about earlier in the call in the question-and-answer period, that FFO to debt to come in 200 basis points to 300 basis points over the next year or so. So, we anticipate consuming that cushion that you might see there otherwise. And I'll let Nick comment on the strategic component. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Yeah. So, we are in the middle of what I would call an M&A transaction without a premium. It's called the Wind Catcher. And so when we look at the strength of the balance sheet, certainly we'll be looking at the financing needs for Wind Catcher and that's a $4.5 billion transaction. So, that's where our thoughts are at this point. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Got you. Thanks so much, guys, appreciate it. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Next is the line of Ali Agha with SunTrust. Please go ahead. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Good morning, Ali. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thank you. Good morning. Nick, to clarify, as you're looking at the four states for approval in Wind Catcher, is it fair to say just given where we are that Oklahoma probably is the most challenged of the four? And related to that, could you theoretically complete the project if the other three states say yes and Oklahoma was to say no? Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Yes. So, on the first point, I would agree with you. Oklahoma has been the most challenging. And really, with the ALJ order there, it made even more of a challenge for the commissioners to really take a look at it from a positive standpoint. But I really believe they will at the end of the day and \u2013 because they obviously look at much broader issues. And so, with that said, I think as far as Wind Catcher is concerned, we intend on this project being for those four states and certainly the FERC customers. There's some FERC customers too that are involved. And if one were to fall out, we're really \u2013 as I said, I mean, I think we're at a good place in terms of the transition of getting this thing across the finish line. And at this point, we really aren't entertaining the notion of going forward with the project without one of the jurisdictions. I really don't see that happening. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: I see. Second question, Brian, wanted to clarify if I heard you right, you were mentioning that when you're looking at your transmission earnings for 2018, you're now thinking they will come in about $0.04 to $0.05 better than what you had indicated to us back at EEI. Is there anything offsetting that? Or in the context of the year, should we see that as a positive cushion that may, if things play out, cause you to move to the right or above your midpoint of your range? Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: That's a good question, Ali. It's really early in the year. And in a company as big as ours, we're going to have pluses and minuses across the year as things go on. So, we wouldn't anticipate any change at this point to what our guidance is. That's just one area that is up versus what we had anticipated. There are others that are down, and we'll lay those out to you as we go through the year on a quarterly basis. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. And last question, can you also remind us relative to the rate increase that you had assumed in your 2018 guidance, how much of that is currently locked in? Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: So, we have about 75% of it's currently locked in. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: 75%. Got it. Thank you. Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Okay. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Thank you, Ali. Operator : Next, we go to a line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Good morning, Paul. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Good morning. How are you? Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Just fine. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Just sort of quickly follow up here on Wind Catcher. Why is it that the \u2013 what are the key issues, I guess, sort of maybe stopping the OCC staff and others from coming on board? Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Your guess is as good as mine. I think, obviously, the ALJ looked at it from a procedural basis it seemed like to me. But we're pretty convinced we did file under the right provisions under Oklahoma law. But obviously, we'll continue with discussions with certainly the Oklahoma staff. And I think \u2013 I really do believe we put provisions in place with the industrials that should benefit that discussion with them. Obviously, to have that kind of company of the customers certainly would help from a policy side and from a staff side to really take a hard look at this. So, the verdict's still out on that and we'll continue those discussions. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. And then, in Oklahoma, there's this tax issue on Wind. I guess we expect it's intertwined with school funding and there was something that passed the House yesterday. And I was just wondering how would that work with respect to the settlement or with respect to the project, or does it have any impact. Can you give us sort of a sense about that? Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Well, it won't have any impact on the project. And it got poured out of the legislature yesterday. So, we don't see that happening. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : I mean, I thought it passed the House is what I just saw. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: No. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : The provision for the tax credit, I thought it was removed. But we can talk about it later. But what you're saying is you don't see any activity on that whatsoever, is what you're...? Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: No. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. So if something like that did happen, though, since it's been sort of debated and what have you, and the school funding issue, in terms of the settlement, how would that \u2013 would that be something that you guys would absorb or would that be something that \u2013 how would that be treated if there was subsequently some sort of impact on wind generation in Oklahoma as a result of something that the state legislature may or may not do in the future? Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Yes. So, there is that risk, but not likely. And the state tax credit wasn't assumed in the Wind Catcher economics, to begin with. So if something were to occur, it wouldn't have any effect. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. So, I got you. Okay. I think maybe that's what was in there. Maybe that's what I'm confused about. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Yeah. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. Great. And that's it. I really appreciate it. Thanks so much, Nick. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Sure thing, Paul. Operator : Next, we go to the line of Christopher Turnure with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Good morning, Christopher. Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Good morning, guys. I just wanted to get your latest thoughts on the potential for grid modernization spend in Ohio. Previously, I think you've talked about $500 million of incremental potential versus your current plan if you get the green light there. But the Commission has been going through exploring the process generically for the whole state and I'm curious to hear your thoughts. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Yes. So, the $500 million was for the entire system, because you know when we presented that EEI. If we were able to get \u2013 move forward with grid modernization in those jurisdictions, there was an incremental $500 million. Certainly, Ohio, the order sort of sets up the tone to really have that discussion because the more we move in the technological front and the more we move into optimization efficiencies around the grid, we'll be able to have those kinds of discussions. And I think yesterday's order of the Ohio Commission was the first step in that process. And I think it bodes well for Ohio and, certainly, we'll use that pattern in the rest of our system as well. So right now, there's nothing incremental on the $500 million. That was a Distribution Investment Rider and those kinds of things. Those issues were already in place. So, we'll obviously continue to have that dialog. Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And then, you mentioned I think towards 2018 year-end the gap between the SEET earnings test in Ohio and the actual earned ROE calculation narrowing. Can you quantify potentially the impact on earnings that that alone would have in 2019? Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Brian. Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Yeah. So, we anticipate it ultimately being around 10% and that's factored into what it is we've guided you to. There's no incremental change to that. Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Fair enough. Thanks, guys. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Yes. Thanks. Sure. Operator : And next, we go to the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Good morning, Michael. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Good morning, Nick. Thank you for taking my questions. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Yeah. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Looking at the cash flow sides in the appendix, the three-year forecast, and this isn't new information. But just curious, you all talk about needing more equity in 2020, but your cash flow actually gets a lot better in 2020, I mean, by like $1 billion if you just use cash from ops minus cash from investing activities. Are you being overly conservative when thinking about 2020? Is the equity really something that might need to come a little bit earlier? It's not a big amount, but like you're pretty cash negative for the next two years and then it gets a lot better. Or is this all just kind of prepping for Wind Catcher? Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: What you see on slide 25 really doesn't include Wind Catcher. And what we're looking at is what happens to our FFO to debt over time and trying to time, like you've seen others do, any equity needs with when they're actually needed and not take the dilutive effect of that sooner than we need to. So, we are going to let our FFO to debt metric deteriorate maybe 200 basis points to 300 basis points, get down into that Baa1 range. And we anticipate needing to bolster that a little bit, but not before the 2020 timeframe. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. And can I ask, what's in that slide? What's your assumption in there for the return of the excess ADFIT, the billion dollars? And the only reason I asked that is one of your neighbors in Louisiana and Arkansas is under a much faster \u2013 and I think one of my colleagues asked this earlier, but their timeline for returning the excess ADIFT is actually a really quick one, like one to three years. I'm just trying to think about what you've assumed or embedded in your guidance on cash flow for that. Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Just assume 7 to 10 years. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. So if it's quicker than that of the return of the excess ADFIT, that would negatively weigh on cash and might either bring forward the equity need or raise the equity need? Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: It's a change in cash flows. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. Okay. Finally, Nick, just kind of you mentioned about the West Virginia rate case filing. How are you thinking about what structural changes in West Virginia you might ask for, and whether you do it in the case filing or whether you do it in some legislative effort? Just it's a state with traditional historical test years, little bit of lag. Just trying to think about how you're thinking big picture there. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Yeah. We haven't supposed any structural changes in West Virginia. And I think, probably, all that West Virginia has been through and going through now from an economic standpoint, we really are focused on ensuring that our rate cases are filed very efficient. They certainly are focused on making sure that we're doing the right things by what we believe in terms of service quality to our customers in West Virginia. I think we probably ought to stick to that approach in West Virginia for the time being. And so, we haven't presupposed any structural changes. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: And when we think about the next seven or eight months, eight or nine months in 2018, how are you thinking about where else kind of sizable general rate case filings may occur? Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Well, really, the only ones would be West Virginia and Oklahoma. Everything else has really flushed itself out this quarter. And so, we're pretty clean going forward from a regulatory standpoint. Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: And of course, Mike, we'll have our usual formula (57:01) base rate filings in places like transmission and Ohio and other places. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. Thank you. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: I would say, on your previous question too, we had Virginia recently in the quarter, they also dismissed a case that would have been for two wind power projects. And so, as Virginia thinks differently than West Virginia, the more we see that from a supply perspective, that's going to be an important data point for us as we go in for these cases, how to deal with that. And so, that would probably be the extent of the \u2013 your structural question just brought up that issue in my mind of how resources are being seen differently in the two jurisdictions and of APCo, and we'll have to try to drive some consistency there. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. Thank you, Nick. Thanks, Brian. Much appreciate it, guys. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Thank you. Bette Jo Rozsa - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: And operator, we have time for one more question. Operator : Very good. It's the line of Angie Storozynski with Macquarie. Please go ahead. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Good morning, Angie. Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Good morning. So, I surprising, had a question about Wind Catcher. So, we've seen a number of renegotiations of wind equipment contracts by utilities, by different developers and OEMs \u2013 with OEMs, seemed willing. So, now that you have these caps on the cost of the projects and then you have the performance guarantees, couldn't you just go back to GE and say, okay, well, this is the reality we're facing, as such we need to actually get a cut on the equipment cost and also maybe you can provide us with a performance guarantee for the wind turbine. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Yeah. Brian. Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: So, Angie, whether it's Invenergy, GE or Quanta, all of our partners have skin in the game on this and they are being very proactive in how they're helping us manage the risk of things like caps relative to the cost of equipment, relative to tax impacts they might have, relative to other increases and decreases in their costs. And it's very much of a partnership rather than a traditional supplier relationship. So, they are working very proactively with us on all those issues. Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Okay. So, basically, the true risk is more on the timing of the construction of the transmission line. I mean if all of the other factors are really, in a sense, mitigated right, the cost of construction of the wind farm, the operating more NCF (59:54) of the wind farms, it's really the transmission line that is more of a risky part of the project? Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: It's all the things that you would think in a project. It's cost and schedule. And so, we have some of the cost mitigated through the partnerships that we have with our suppliers and they're also helping us to mitigate the schedule component of it as well. So, it's what you would expect in a project of this size and scope. We need to bring it in at cost, on budget, and on schedule, and we have experienced partners who are working with us to help us do that. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: And we've mitigated pieces of the risk too, because we're acquiring the plant at commercial operation. So, Invenergy is obviously doing their work associated with that. It's been well thought out. Going to your earlier point though, we obviously are paying particular attention to the generation interconnection or you call it transmission, that piece of it to ensure, from a supplier perspective, we're in good shape. We've had conversations with certainly their executive leadership about the importance of the arrangement we have in place. And I think in terms of routing, that work continues in earnest and alternatives are considered in earnest. So when you look at the construction side and the risk being taken, we're in really good shape. Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Okay. And the last question is \u2013 so you mentioned that now under the new tax regime, you won't be paying taxes for longer \u2013 cash taxes. And so, what happens with the PTCs and accelerated depreciation generated by this project? Maybe you've said that, but are you using a tax equity investor or are actually considering using that? Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: So, right now, we don't anticipate needing one, but we are monitoring very closely our tax appetite with our ability to use the PTCs as we take on a project the size of Wind Catcher and trying to make sure those things match up. That's something that's contemplated in the settlements that we're talking about. And to the degree that we're not able to use them on the same time, there will be an ability to defer the tax asset and earn some recovery on it. Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Thank you. Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Thank you. Bette Jo Rozsa - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Thank you, everyone, for joining us on today's call. And as always, the IR team will be available to answer any additional questions you may have.

We will take your questions following their remarks. I will now turn the call over to Nick. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Thanks, Bette Jo. Good morning, everyone, and welcome again to AEP's second quarter 2018 earnings call. We just completed a very healthy second quarter financially primarily due to weather that continued strong economy in the regions of the country that we serve and further resolution of rate making activities. And, of course, while not complete yet, further approvals occurring \u2013 have occurred regarding Wind Catcher that I'll cover later. The weather has been a significant story for the quarter. In a nutshell, second quarter was bipolar with no spring. As further proof that we did not have a spring this year, get this, it's almost like a brainteaser, the second quarter 2018 was the fourth coldest second quarter and the second warmest second quarter in the AEP system in nearly 50 years, because winter went well into April and summer came early in May. So, we benefited from that from both angles. Additionally, regarding the economy in the service territory, the AEP service territory economy and load performance continues to be as strong as it has been in years. Brian will be covering the weather and economic information in more detail later. With that said, we are reaffirming our guidance for the year of $3.75 per share to $3.95 per share and our 5% to 7% growth rate, and as we have said previously, this base plan does not include Wind Catcher. We are also today giving our first signal of 2021 capital budgets assuming no Wind Catcher to reinforce that our investment thesis as a foundational benchmark is and has been our continued guidance that reflects a long-term 5% to 7% growth rate. Getting to the financials for the quarter, we had strong earnings for the second quarter 2018 with a $1.07 per share GAAP and a $1.01 per share operating versus $0.76 a share GAAP and $0.75 a share operating, respectively, in 2017. So, overall, a great quarter. This brings year-to-date earnings on a GAAP and operating basis to $2 per share and $1.97 per share respectively versus year-to-date 2017 earnings of $1.97 GAAP and $1.72 per share operating. So, overall, a strong quarter and a strong year so far. Concerning the regulatory update, I'm sure many on this call want to hear about our thoughts on Wind Catcher. First, I am pleased with the Arkansas, Louisiana and FERC approvals we have achieved thus far. The focus now is almost entirely on Texas and Oklahoma to complete the regulatory approvals necessary to continue towards financing and construction. We heard both commissions register their concerns about appropriate customer protection related issues, landowner considerations in Oklahoma, needed time to review to \u2013 and render thoughtful decisions, and employment-related information benefiting each state. Most of these issues were also considered in the other state jurisdictions as well and these values were recognized in the various state approvals as well as settlements with the parties. AEP, PSO and SWEPCO, from the very beginning, have worked extensively to evaluate the risks of the project to our shareholders and our customers to deliver the important benefits of lower customer bills, valuable hedges on future energy process, and diversity of supply, while achieving substantial economic benefits to the states involved with this project. Chair Walker and the other commissioners in Texas asked us to review our customer protections in relation to other outcomes in a previous case involving Xcel SPS and had questions regarding employment from a Texas perspective supporting the project. We responded with a letter detailing side-by-side comparisons of not only the customer protection mechanisms with the previous SPS order, but also the additional hold harmless provision items that are guaranteed from the Arkansas, Louisiana and Oklahoma settlement and outcomes. As any other state jurisdictions, we discussed the substantial employment and economic development benefits of this project as well. These provisions go well beyond any assurances provided for other types of generation such as natural gas. Additionally, our letter indicated that in response to concerns in Oklahoma and Texas regarding the timing required to review the case by the commissioners, we negotiated with our supplier partners a further four-week time delay until the end of August to accommodate further consideration. The letter indicates our position on the deal parameters in response to commission concerns as well as indications of the necessary timing for a decision. I just want to be clear, this letter is meant to be supportive and responsive to commission concerns, but it is necessary because we at AEP are bound by externalities that we have limited or no control to drive the need for a decision to move forward, namely, time to construct the project, to deal with right of way land owners in as flexible fashion as possible to minimize potential condemnations, and to obtain full value of the PTCs to meet our customer guarantees and produce substantial benefits to our customers. This project started with a degree of excitement, primarily driven by our view from a strategic sense of what we can do to minimize what we call percentage of pocket book impacting our customers. We recognize that if we can spend capital to reduce customers' bills, it's a win-win that will not only define the utility of the future but ensure that we remain relevant to our customers. We are not bound by the coal lobby, the natural gas lobby or the renewables lobby. We are committed to a diverse energy portfolio that provides inherent risk management benefits to our customers. And in the case of Oklahoma, as the State of Texas has done with the CRES build out, the importance of this project is to ensure that all resources, including natural gas and renewables, indigenous to the state can produce diversity of supply and economic development benefits for the states that we are proud to serve. We have another hearing before the Texas Commission tomorrow and we stand ready to answer any questions that the commissioners may have and Oklahoma is contemplating its order as we speak. AEP believes, through multiple negotiations and commission feedback received in these states, we have struck a balance between our shareholder, our customer and the state interest impacted by this important project. And we look forward to an ultimate resolution by the end of August. Because football season is on us, I'm using a football analogy. We're deep in the red zone with time running out, third down with two plays to go, needing a touchdown with both plays already called, they're called Texas and Oklahoma. Get your beer and chicken wings for an exciting month ahead. From a shareholder perspective, there have been questions regarding the time limit for a decision and the risk that the company is willing to take on the Wind Catcher project. Certainly, there are parameters that can be dealt with around the edges, but the deal structure and timing are embodied in the letter to Chair Walker and was also sent to the Oklahoma Commission. We need some consistency in the approach and communications to both of these commissions to bring the decision making to a common view. We will certainly live with the outcome that emerges from both the Oklahoma and Texas commissions and we will know, we gave it our best shot with this very unique and ingenious project regardless of outcome. Certainly, we would like Wind Catcher to be approved and move forward, but to reiterate, the foundation of this company remains solid and our growth plans continue to support a 5% to 7% growth rate trajectory regardless. Our investors can count on the constant earnings and dividend growth that they have come to expect from a premium regulated utility. Brian will introduce our 2021 capital plan that further demonstrates our commitment to this growth rate. We at AEP, nor others, can predict what these two commissions will do to answer the question of whether AEP can move forward with Wind Catcher. But we'll know soon, we'll know soon by the end of August. And as Bob Dylan said, the answer my friend is blowing in the wind. Now, let's move to the equalizer chart. So, as we go through the various states, overall, our regulated operations ROE is approximately 10% versus 9.5% last quarter. Overall, we generally project the ROE to be around that 10% range, given our geographic diversity. Some companies will be up, some will be down, but as we demonstrated by our historical performance, we are generally in that 9.5% to 10% range. Furthermore, as we noted on the slides, we certainly have five states, five rate cases that we recently completed and one in process which will help some of the underperforming companies. So, I guess, as we go through these individual companies, looking at AEP Ohio, the ROE for AEP Ohio at the end of the second quarter 2018 was 13.8%. Keep in mind that includes some legacy items that are included from previous activities associated with the deregulation that occurred before, those roll out now primarily by the end of the year with a small portion going into next year. So, we show this, the 13.8% overall, with those legacy items, but the actual return on equity is 12.1% for Ohio. Moving to APCo, the APCo ROE at the end of 2018 was 9.7% and APCo's improvement is primarily due to weather. West Virginia is earning in the high 7% range and that's why we have a rate case that's been filed for a rate increase of $115 million with rates effective in March of 2019 in that state. Of course, Virginia is still \u2013 we have established tri-annual rate reviews, AEP's first review for APCo Virginia will be in 2020 and it will cover the 2017-2019 timeframe. Moving to Kentucky, the ROE for Kentucky at the end of the second quarter 2018 was 8.7%. Their rate case is complete, helping drive the turnaround along with better than normal weather conditions for the first half of the year. We expect to earn near the authorized return by the end of the year in Kentucky and, of course, their continued long-term strategic plan is around economic development in that region and certainly our president there has had a lot of success in moving that process forward. So, we expect big things there. I&M achieved their ROE of 11.9% at the end of the second quarter 2018. I&M had a positive start to 2018, primarily driven by strong sales in all segments, favorable weather, disciplined OEM spending, and favorable one-time true-ups associated with regulatory items. So, I&M continues to spend capital, of course, at nuclear station and in distribution and transmission. So \u2013 and certainly their base rates went into effect in both the Michigan and Indiana jurisdictions as a result of the last rate cases. PSO, the ROE for PSO at the end of the second quarter was 6.5%. PSOs earned ROE has been slightly boosted by positive weather, but we still are challenged based on regulatory lag in that state. So, we'll be following another rate case in Oklahoma in the third quarter of 2018 to help address this regulatory lag and other matters. As far as SWEPCO is concerned, the ROE of SWEPCO at the end of the second quarter was 6.8%. The primary reason for the increase is improved weather over the last year. Results also reflect a full quarter of rate relief implemented late last year, last year in May in our Louisiana and Texas jurisdictions. And of course, the ROE continues to be burdened by the overall \u2013 by the Arkansas \u2013 what was the Arkansas share of the Turk plant, the 88 megawatts in Turk, and we continue to look for a home for that. AEP Texas, the ROE there is \u2013 for the second quarter, was 9.5%. While earnings have grown year-over-year, the reason for the declining ROE is due to timing of annual T cost filings as we continue to make significant transmission investments along with some timing related to O&M spend. So, still a very good opportunity there in AEP Texas. AEP Transmission Holdco, the ROE there is at 11.2%. It's lower than first quarter ROE as a result of the 12-month rolling income calculation. So, the second quarter 2018 had a smaller true-up reflecting the new forward formula rates that are now in the process of being implemented. So, that's the \u2013 overall, things are going pretty well from a ROE perspective. We continue to work on and seen the results of the five rate cases that we had filed last year and, of course, we have one going on now and one pending. So, we'll continue with that approach to ensure that we continue to manage around that 10%. So, second quarter and year-to-date have moved along positively, and the third quarter will be definitive for Wind Catcher. AEP will continue with a firm foundation that provides excellent value for our shareholders and our customers. So, I'll turn it over to Brian. Brian? Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Thank you, Nick, and good morning, everyone. I'll take us through the second quarter and year-to-date financial results, provide some insight on load in the economy, review our balance sheet and liquidity, and provide detail on our 2021 base case capital expenditures and equity needs. Let's begin on slide 6 which shows that operating earnings for the second quarter were $1.01 per share or $498 million compared to $0.75 per share or $370 million in 2017. Most of this year-over-year growth came from weather and the recovery of incremental investment to serve our customers. Looking at the drivers by segment, earnings for the Vertically Integrated Utilities were $0.56 per share, up $0.31. Weather was a large driver in this quarter with most of the $0.12 increase driven by warmer than normal temperatures in the late spring. Rate changes were also favorable due to the recovery of incremental investment across multiple jurisdictions and formula rate true-ups. The box for this segment was other smaller impacts. The Transmission & Distribution Utility segment earned $0.23 per share comparable to last year. As anticipated, AEP Transmission Holdco segment was unfavorable to the second quarter last year due to the minimal formula rate true up this year compared to the larger one in the second quarter of 2017. This was expected due to the change in methodology to fully forward-looking test years. This impact was partially offset by increased investment which has grown by $1.7 billion since last June. Generation & Marketing produced earnings of $0.05 per share, up $0.01 from last year, and Corporate and Other was down $0.01 due to higher interest. Let's turn to slide 7 and review our year-to-date results. Operating earnings through June were $1.97 per share or $972 million, compared to $1.72 per share or $845 million in 2017. Our regulated segments experienced growth for the year and, as expected, our competitive Generation & Marketing business was down due to last year's asset sales. Let's look at the earnings drivers by segment. Operating earnings for the Vertically Integrated Utilities were $1.03 per share, up $0.34 with the single largest driver being weather which added $0.24. Successful implementation of rate changes added another $0.14. Other favorable items included higher transmission revenues and normalized load. Offsetting these drivers were anticipated in decreases in our wholesale load as well as increased O&M and depreciation expenses. Through June, the Transmission & Distribution Utilities segment earned $0.49 per share, up $0.02 from last year. Favorable drivers included higher rate changes, normalized load and weather, which were partially offset by higher depreciation. The AEP Transmission Holdco segment contributed $0.42 per share, up $0.01 from last year. This growth in earnings reflected our return on incremental rate base and small non-recurring items which were mostly offset by the larger prior year formula rate true-up. Generation & Marketing produced earnings of $0.13 per share, down $0.05 from last year, again, mostly due to the sale of the assets. Finally, Corporate and Other was down $0.07 per share from last year due to higher interest and tax expenses and a prior-year investment gain. Overall, we are pleased with our results and confident in reaffirming our annual operating earnings guidance. Now, let's turn to slide 8 for an update on normalized load growth. The load story has been positive through the first half of 2018. Starting in the lower-right chart, our normalized retail sales increased by 2% for the quarter and were up 1.7% year-to-date, both of which are above expectations for the year. In both comparisons, we experienced normalized load growth across all three retail classes. Moving clockwise, industrial sales increased by 3% for the quarter and grew by 2.8% compared to the first half of last year. Industrial sales have been strong for over a year now with growth spread across most industries and operating companies. The sectors that posted the strongest growth in this quarter were all energy-related which is consistent with rising oil prices. In the upper-left chart normalized residential sales were up 2.1% for the quarter and 1.7% for the year. The chart shows consistent improvement in residential sales over the past year. Once again, growth was spread across nearly every operating company. Through June, customer accounts were up 0.5% compared to last year which is the strongest we've experienced since 2015. Weather-normalized usage was also up 1.7% this quarter and 1.2% year-to-date which correlates with the recent improvement in household incomes, which I'll discuss in more detail in the next slide. Finally, in the upper-right chart, commercial sales increased 0.7% in the second quarter and increased 0.6% through June. The growth in commercial sales was not as strong in other classes, but still positive. Now, let's move on to slide 9 and review the status of our regional economies. As shown in the upper left chart, GDP growth in AEP service territory exceeded the U.S. by 0.10% for the second quarter. In fact, the economy in AEP service territory has been growing at a faster pace than the U.S. since the second quarter of 2017. The upper right chart shows the gap in unemployment growth is narrowing between AEP service territory and the U.S. While U.S. job growth has been stable over the past year, AEP's job growth has continued to improve. For the quarter, job growth in AEP's territory was 1.1% with higher growth in our western territory. Another key indicator for measuring the health of the labor market is the unemployment rate. While the U.S. unemployment rate is the lowest it has been since the early 2000s, unemployment in AEP service territory is currently at its record low and is expected to fall further. One key driver of the tightening labor market has been changing demographics. As more baby boomers retire, businesses are looking to fill those positions from the available labor force. In some industries, businesses are struggling to find qualified labor. As the competition for labor has increased, wages have finally started to rise. The bottom chart on this page shows growth in personal income. Through the first half of 2018, income growth within AEP service territory has exceeded the U.S. For the quarter, AEP customer incomes were 4.6% higher than last year. The increase of income is a key driver for the higher residential usage this year. Overall, higher energy prices and incomes and a relatively healthy global economy have combined to create a positive environment for sales through the first half of 2018. However, tightening labor markets, higher inflation and escalating trade tensions are items with potential headwinds for the second half. Now, let's turn to slide 10 and review the company's capitalization and liquidity. Our debt to total capital ratio increased 0.2% during the quarter to 56.8%. Our FFO to debt ratio was solidly in the Baa1 range at 19.3% and our net liquidity stood at about $1.4 billion supported by our revolving credit facility. Our Qualified Pension Funding improved to 103% and our OPEB funding improved to 134%. For both plans, the funded status improved due to rising interest rates, driving a decrease in liabilities that more than offset asset losses. Now, let's turn to slide 11 and review some detail about 2021 CapEx and capital needs. As Nick mentioned and as we've talked about before, AEP has a solid organic growth plan that supports our 5% to 7% growth rate. In particular, we have robust Transmission & Distribution capital expenditure opportunities for the foreseeable future, exclusive of Wind Catcher. To demonstrate this confidence, we are introducing our 2021 plan, which includes $6.3 billion of capital expenditures, of which, 100% is allocated to our regulated businesses in contracted renewables and 75% is allocated to wires. In the appendix of our presentation on page 34, we show the pinwheel detail for where the capital will be spent. Similar to 2020, an incremental $400 million of equity above our DRIP (23:11) is required to support that spend and maintain our capital metrics. Let's try and wrap this up on slide 12, so we can get to your questions. We will obtain clarity on the Wind Catcher project and continue working with regulators to provide the best solution for customers regarding tax reform. Our base plan is robust and supports our 5% to 7% growth rate even before the addition of Wind Catcher. Our year-to-date performance and the stability of our regulated business model give us the confidence to reaffirm our operating earnings guidance range of $3.75 to $3.95 per share. With that, I will turn the call over to the operator for your questions. Operator : Our first question is from the line of Julien Dumoulin. Please go ahead. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Good morning, Julien. Claire Zeng - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : : Hi. Good morning. This is Claire (24:13) for Julien. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Hello, Claire (24:14). Claire Zeng - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : : Hey, good morning. Good morning, team. Thanks for taking my question. My first question is recognizing that you guys will continue to work on regulatory approvals for Wind Catcher. Can you give a little more color for what other configuration or what other projects you could replace it with that would still take advantage of the one PTC (24:34) and the other PPA contracting structures as well. Just curious about any options there? Thank you. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Yeah. So, Claire (24:43), we continue to look at other opportunities where we have the renewables projects in Ohio, for example. We obviously continue that process. There will be other opportunities, but tax reform is certainly \u2013 has certainly changed some of the economics of some of these projects, particularly with lower capacity factors. So, we'll continue to look for opportunities to replace it. But remember, Wind Catcher was incremental to our base plan. So \u2013 and our base plan obviously supports the 5% to 7% growth rate in the investment in transmission and other areas in our regulated companies. So, with Wind Catcher, obviously, we'll continue to look at not only options. If Wind Catcher were not to happen, there'll still be opportunities for those kinds of resources to be applied through our resource plans in those particular states, so \u2013 but obviously, don't want to miss the opportunity for Wind Catcher because it's a great way to deal with the resource plans in all of those states at one time rather than independently with perhaps less efficient projects. So, we'll continue to take a look at it. Claire Zeng - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. That's really helpful. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Yeah. Claire Zeng - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : And my second question is \u2013 this is a little early, I think. For your CapEx update, can you give a little more color as to why you're doing it before November and potentially any color around more than just the 75% of wires, how you're increasing above your 2020 run rate? Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Yeah. So, let me answer the first one, Claire (26:29). We keep getting questions about how solid our go-forward plan is and what's the ability to keep investing it organically in our own businesses and we wanted to provide some clarity to that to show that we have plenty of runway to invest organically in our own system, primarily in the wires side of the business with some regulated and contracted renewables as well. So, people are asking, how long can you keep doing that for? And we wanted to provide some clarity. It's out there and we have plenty of runway to keep doing that and felt that the disclosure at this time might be helpful to people as they think about our stock. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: There seem to be some confusion about whether Wind Catcher was required for us to continue with our 5% to 7% long-term growth rate. The answer to that is no, it's not required to do that. Our base plan is built around 5% to 7% and Wind Catcher was incremental. We just wanted to make sure that that was abundantly clear and that people weren't looking across the cliff and expecting something different regardless of the outcome. Now, if we get it, that's great. But if we don't, well, okay, we'll move forward with our plan. Claire Zeng - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got it. That's helpful. I will drop out of the queue. Thanks so much. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Thanks. Operator : We have a question from Ali Agha. Please go ahead. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Good morning, Ali. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thank you, good morning. Good morning. First up, on Wind Catcher, Nick, to be clear, if either Texas or Oklahoma does not approve, can the project still go forward or do you need both of those approvals for this project to happen? Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Yeah. My going-in assumption is we need both of those approvals, because these are regulated jurisdictions and that's where the needs are. And so, our \u2013 certainly, our strong preferences for that project is sized based upon the wind farm that's in existence with the transmission line and to do something different than that would be suboptimal so, we're really focused on making sure that all of the jurisdictions approve it. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. And then, secondly, we've seen it now a few times. The sort of, what I would call, the drop dead date keeps getting shifted back. Now, you're telling us its end of August. So, in reality, when you look at the physical aspect of having it all built by the end of 2020, when exactly do you need to have this started? And, I guess, related to that, I'm sure you've been observing your stock has been under a fair amount of pressure while this uncertainty is out there. So, at what point do you make the call that \u2013 the base plan is so strong that we are maybe better off getting this uncertainty off the table and walk away here? Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Yeah, Ali. Already \u2013 we've already started with right of way. We've also done other construction-related activities because we don't have time. And so, your question is a very fair question, though, from an investor standpoint. We cannot afford to continue to allow this thing to languish given construction has started, the company is incurring expenses associated with it, our supply contracts. And I think it's probably known now that the target dates for ordering long lead time equipment and that kind of thing through these major contracts was around that August 6 timeframe, and we were able to negotiate and look at the project plans and do a deep dive in terms of what we could possibly do. And that's where the end of August came from. So \u2013 and in deference to the commissions \u2013 and both commissions, certainly, it appeared Chairman Murphy wanted to take more time, and Chairman Walker wanted to take more time, wished they had more time. Well, we tried to accommodate that by the additional time necessary to get past \u2013 I know there's a lot going on with election season and all kinds of things occurring. So, we're saying the end of August and that's where we're at. And for us to go beyond that is going to be extremely difficult with major commitments of these large capital items and that's just not going to happen without the approvals necessary. So \u2013 and it's not because we're trying to be \u2013 just trying to make sure the commissions are pushed in a very hard fashion. That's not what we're trying to do; it's that we're getting pushed. And it's unfortunate that we didn't have several years to evaluate this project, but the PTC is the 100% value. The PTC, we're trying to secure for the customer benefits and we've got to be able to finish the project in time to enable that to happen. I mean, it's a 60% off-sale, and if you don't want to take advantage of it, then just tell us. And I think that's basically what I've been saying to the commissions. We've offered this opportunity and it is a real, distinct and positive opportunity, but we need an answer and we need an answer by the end of August and certainly, from the \u2013 you bring up the elements of risk as well from a deal parameter perspective. We've been in negotiations with parties in all of these states and you're seeing the culmination of multiple sets of negotiations with varied parties and I think we've round up with the best balance we possibly could. So, I'm hopeful that the commissions will look at that and look at the track record and look at what we're trying to do and keep in mind we're spending money to get an answer to help customers. And so, we're fine with doing that because it's a really great opportunity in our opinion and we're intent on trying to provide as much benefit as we can to our customers and that's what we're focused on. So, I hope that answers the question. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Yes. No, I really appreciate that. Brian, one quick one for you. Can you just remind us of the rate increases that you had budgeted for 2018 in your guidance, how much are now locked in for you? Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: So, we were calling for a little bit over $300 million and we're about 80-or-so percent locked in. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Got it. Thank you. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Thank you. Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Thanks. Operator : We have a question from Steve Fleishman. Please go ahead. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Hey, Steve. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Hi, good morning. Couple of questions. Hi, Nick. So I guess, first just to clarify, the 5% to 7% growth rate \u2013 I think officially you've only given after 2019 but should we interpret that with this capital plan, it would extend through this 2021? Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Yeah. So, we've given that \u2013 we've given the detail around it through 2020. Now, we're giving an incremental year, but we see that 5% to 7% growth rate as far as we can see. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Great. Okay. And then, secondly, on Wind Catcher. So, one -there's a reasonable chance that one outcome could be approval with conditions. So, that then leads to another process of do conditions work or not? So, when you're giving this kind of end of August deadline, is that, you just need to make a go/no-go call by then or... Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Yeah. That's right. That's right, Steve. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: And it also means \u2013 and you're exactly right on that the deal parameters. We saw the sense of urgency. So, when we sent the letter into the commission, it was really responsive because really the discussion had been around 103% on the cost gap, while SPS was 102.5%, so we changed it to a 102.5%. I mean \u2013 and it's those things that Chairman Walker was bringing up. Okay, we said, we were going to match up the SPS, then we had the hold harmless provisions. It went even beyond. And I think that \u2013 and that was really responsive to her and her concerns and there are other commissioners' as well, and of course, the Oklahoma Commissioner's too. So, we put our best foot forward to say, this is the parameters of what a deal would look like. And I would say that \u2013 and I had mentioned this earlier in my comments, and I guess it was on purpose \u2013 but there is \u2013 you can play around with the edges, but the main parameters of the deal have been discussed for, really, for a year now. And with multiple parties and those provisions are pretty well-defined. So, for us to take on more risk beyond those parameters is not likely to happen either. So, I guess, I'm just saying, we sort of cut to the chase. And we cut to the chase based on the responses of the \u2013 what the commissioners were telling us and we put our best foot forward. So, it's \u2013 so our best foot forward is there from a parameter perspective. Our best foot forward is there from a timing perspective. And what I've said all along, we need an answer. And back to Ali's question of, we've had pressure on our stock. Well, because no one knows exactly where we're taking this and I'm just \u2013 guess I'm just reinforcing to you that we're about to take this to a closing, one way or another. Because we've got to get on with other decisions to be made relative to enhancing our shareholders value and that's what we're going to do. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. And then, I guess one other question in that light. So, if you go back about, I think, 6, 12 months, you had talked about concern about the Oklahoma regulatory environment and I don't think you were that happy with the rate order. Early this year and then we'll see what happens with Wind Catcher, but just is that still kind of an issue that's in play based on the outcome here? Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: I think, actually \u2013 I think we've made a lot of progress from an Oklahoma standpoint just because of the dialogue that we've been having relative to the Wind Catcher case. And the dialogue that we've had post-rate case environments and pre-rate case environments. I think the issues are becoming more known from an Oklahoma perspective. And I think we've done a really good job of trying to do the best we possibly can for Oklahoma customers. And I think that's starting to get recognized and I really believe that we have the real potential of being on an upward trajectory as it relates to PSO because of \u2013 and I can tell you that there has been a lot of discussion post-rate cases and that kind of thing, but the kind of discussions we've had relative to Wind Catcher and really the stretch that we've put in here to try to do the best we can for Oklahoma customers is not going unrecognized. And so \u2013 and as I mentioned earlier, there will be another rate case filing in the third quarter in Texas and in Oklahoma. And that will be \u2013 I think that will be sort of a new beginning and one where we can really look at the issues in Oklahoma. I think there's a better understanding of the issues and I think we have some great commissioners there that really understand what the issues are. So, we're hopeful that we can make progress there. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. Thank you. Operator : We have a question from Paul Patterson. Please go ahead. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Hey Paul. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Hi. How are you doing? Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Just right. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Just procedurally, what should we expect, I guess \u2013 what procedurally is expected to happen on Thursday in Texas? I know you guys are \u2013 have lengthened the period for decision making, but I'm just wondering what \u2013 is it possible to get a decision on Thursday? Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Yeah, I don't know the answer to that. I think there's probably, in my mind, a couple of options. One is that the commission does decide to vote on the arrangement based on the input that we provided. The other option, probably could be more likely, would be that \u2013 Chairman Walker had talked about coming up with a list of questions and we responded to the ones we knew of. There may be other questions. So, there could be questions answered and then there's two weeks, I think, two weeks from then, is another commission hearing. So, whether we're on the docket or not, I don't know, but there is opportunities now that we've given to the end of August for that kind of thing to occur. So, that's up to the commission. But that's sort of the way that \u2013 the two alternatives that I see. I'd rather have them approve it at (41:25) Thursday. That'd be great. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Yeah, get some closure here. But... Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Yeah. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : And then, also \u2013 and just to clarify on the Ali Agha's question. There is really, I guess, no sort of Wind Catcher light or \u2013 I mean, basically, it's kind of you guys might do other things, obviously, you're always looking for things and other opportunities, but it sounds like, essentially, it's kind of \u2013 this deal is kind of \u2013 it's kind of a pretty much not really given to any significant modification, if this doesn't have \u2013 if there's a rejection or something like that, we shouldn't think of there being a sort of Wind Catcher light opportunity per se with respect to this project, is that correct? Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: That's correct. I think you could see, I mean, obviously, with the integrated resource plans that we followed, you may see smaller projects develop in some fashion but they could be renewables, may not be renewables. So, you really \u2013 but you won't see another Wind Catcher-like project because that one has \u2013 that one's very unique in its scope and scale and the benefits provided. And so, it's \u2013 you're probably moving to either less efficient type of opportunities and there certainly will continue to develop those kinds of options. But keep in mind, you should look at AEP as a 5% to 7% foundational growth stock with all these little incremental opportunities. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Awesome. Thanks so much. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Yes. Operator : We have a question from Angie Storozynski. Please go ahead. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Hey, Angie. How are you? Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Hi. How are you? Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Good. Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: So, I have a bigger picture question. So, I mean, the utilities \u2013 electricity utilities (43:26) industry is clearly evolving and I'm trying to have some lessons learned from what have happened in Europe. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Yes. Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: And I'm asking this because about 50% of your CapEx plan is transmission spending through 2021 and yet we have seen it in Europe, that transmission CapEx or transmission investments have been falling because utilities are choosing instead to go with distributed generation, sometimes backed by batteries. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Right. Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: And we're hearing the same types of ideas now coming up from Midwestern utilities. And so, my question is, one, do you think that you need to somehow diversify your growth plan? And two, was the Wind Catcher basically an attempt to become less dependent on the \u2013 on transmission spending or was it some somewhat completely independent? Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: It's a big question. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Angie, you should be involved with our strategy sessions because there's no question that this industry is changing dramatically and we recognize that at some point in time transmission will essentially saturate in some fashion, but that horizon is really a decade out. Because in the U.S., which is \u2013 I really talk a lot to the people at RWE Energy, Ineo, (44:53) other areas of Europe as well. And they're much more compartmentalized, but they're also, from a renewables perspective, the renewables are starting to slow down somewhat, at least large scale renewables. But in the U.S., that's still developing. And what we have to think about, though \u2013 and you're exactly right \u2013 as you bridge from the transmission-related investment, we see the incoming growth strategy around the innovation on the Distribution side. So, in the past, if you think about the way we've been investing, a huge amount of what we invested 5, 10 years ago was generation-related, then it became transmission-related. Now, you're seeing the continued development of transmission. And then, eventually, that will saturate but the growing part of it now is the distribution investment at the operating companies focused on bringing about the \u2013 effectuating the new technologies and development associated with either distributor resources, Big Data analytics, all the optimization activities going on. Those are clearly opportunities for us in the future. And that's why we're so focused on the customer and focused on making sure that that we are able to deliver those types of technologies where we're part of \u2013 we're the only U.S. utility that's part of an international consortium that does, essentially, a shark tank around the world. And I just got back from California where there were 2,000 start-ups that were evaluated, and it was called down to a list of 15. We're doing pilots with four of them, at least, at this point, and that's where the future is starting to develop. So, you're exactly right. And the way we see it is bending the O&M curve is a big part of what we're doing, because, obviously, with optimization, efficiencies, digital experiences, all those types of things in order (47:04) to that benefit, but the capitalization will continue to be transmissioned and then you'll see an emerging distribution component of it as well. So, as far as the eye can see, we're in a great shape from an investment standpoint because of that transition. Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Okay. That's all I have. Thank you. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Thank you. Operator : We have a question from Praful Mehta. Please go ahead. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks so much. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Hey, Praful. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi guys. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: How are you doing? Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Good. So, thanks for all the color on Wind Catcher. I guess \u2013 and you're reiterating the 5% to 7% growth. I guess, my question is, if Wind Catcher does go through, is the right way to think about it is that Wind Catcher will be all incremental growth to the 5% to 7% or will there be some capital allocation limitation when you say the 5% to 7% doesn't all add up with incremental Wind Catcher, but it's somewhere in between? How should we think about that kind of mix if you did get Wind Catcher? Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: So, think of it as incremental. What we've announced to-date, some of that could be pushed out in time, but still within the 5% to 7% growth rate. Does that make sense? Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. But there is a little bit of room of something getting pushed out just to kind of fit the Wind Catcher CapEx in there, is that right? Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Absolutely. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Got you. All right. And then, given the strong quarter and the weather help I guess in Q2, is there any reason why kind of guidance is maintained right now at the same level? Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Yeah. So, you know what a big swing for us the third quarter is and there are big items that will be ins and outs. I think Nick talked about some of the expenses that we're having with Wind Catcher as we go forward in time. It doesn't make sense for us to change the guidance at this point. The way we see it, we're still inside that range that we've identified, and if there's any change to that, we'd likely be making that after the third quarter. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: And there are things that, that we \u2013 we usually use weather as an opportunity to move O&M. So, you could see some O&M move that was in 2019 to 2018 (49:13) or that kind of thing, we typically do that on a regular basis, because we do want to show that certainty and consistency around 5% to 7% in our earnings guidance. Now, you can only do that to a certain extent, right? So, if you do wind up with the rest of the year or like the first part of the year, then who knows how much you can absolutely \u2013 that you can do? But our view is really that credibility around the guidance that we put out in making sure that we can deliver on that regardless of what's going on with weather as we demonstrated last year, and then continue that as we go forward. So, we'll \u2013 and as Brian said, typically, we wait for third quarter to determine what the future holds in terms of guidance. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Got you. That's super helpful color. And then, finally, just now that you'll soon have some form of decision on Wind Catcher and tax reform kind of is done and \u2013 or at least mostly known in terms of what to play out the scenarios are, is there any strategic review that we should be thinking about that you guys are looking at in terms of your business mix or just anything that needs to be cleaned up internally? Or do you think, currently, the kind of combination of businesses or utilities you have is the right fit and there's nothing really to be done on the strategic side? Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Yeah. We've already done it. We already done sort of a major housecleaning. So, we're a pretty pristine stock and when you \u2013 now, that being said, we're always looking at ways to optimize our portfolio and \u2013 but you also have to look at the uses, right? So, we have a lot of sources, we have a lot of uses. And so \u2013 and certainly our balance sheet is strong, so we can do a lot of things. But obviously, they're all centered upon ensuring that we are able to deliver on the guidance and the growth rates that we've laid out, and that's why we show \u2013 you can \u2013 and this sort of comes and goes. I mean, you can have a jurisdiction or a state jurisdiction that says, okay, it's suffering and maybe we should do something. Well, it takes a little time to really figure out, is that a \u2013 just a systemic problem or do we need to do something about it? But that's really the way we look at it. I mean, it is portfolio management, but its smart portfolio management around the delivery expectations around our growth rate and our guidance. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Got you. Thanks so much. Super helpful. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Yes. Bette Jo Rozsa - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: And operator, we can \u2013 we have time for one more question. Operator : Okay. We'll go to the line of Anthony Crowdell. Please go ahead. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Good morning, Anthony. Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC : Hey. Good morning. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Morning. Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC : Hey, Nick, I'll direct it to you to give Brian a little break from doing all the talking. But just quickly, any agreement that you reach or the detail that you reached in Texas or Oklahoma, but is there a most favored nation that hold harmless guarantee will apply to the other two jurisdictions? Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Yeah. So, all of the jurisdictions have a hold harmless provision, so \u2013 and that's really the key part of it. I mean, every adjustment we make is not just an adjustment in that jurisdiction, it's adjustment across the board. So, that's why we have to be particularly careful from a risk perspective and that's why we've laid out in the letter what our expectation is. And then, FERC customers are obviously treated differently because of their own arrangements, but that's really the way it works. Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC : Is that the biggest hurdle, you believe, for the Oklahoma and Texas commissions? Is this hold harmless or are there other details that are what's delaying it in those two states? Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Well, I think, certainly, election season in Oklahoma is pretty distracting. And also, you have some parties in the states, like the Attorney General in Oklahoma, that they did a settlement \u2013 they call it a settlement deal, I don't know what it is. But with the staff that had provisions that were \u2013 they were way off base. So, a lot of discussion about that. And I think there's just a lot of confusion out there and sometimes you focus so much on the margins of what could happen to this and could happen to that, it's almost like finishing up a contract versus looking at the amazing benefits across the board that are out there. So, you're getting hung up in a lot of that kind of dialogue. And then, in Texas, you've got the industrials and others that now, the \u2013 (54:38) at least the attorney for the industrials that \u2013 using different gas forecast and all that kind of stuff and it sort of confuses the parties that are listening. So, when you get past all of that, and you get just to the facts, then I think we'll be in much better shape. Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC : Great. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: (55:00) Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC : Too bad your family wasn't selling Chevys in other parts of SWEPCO. It was probably one of the easier states to Louisiana. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Yeah. My dad used to be a used car salesman and sold Chevys in Louisiana, so... Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC : Maybe you should have rethought about Texas or Oklahoma, but thanks for taking my question. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Yeah. Yeah, thanks. Bette Jo Rozsa - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Okay. Well, thank you everyone, for joining us on today's call.

We will take your questions following their remarks. I will now turn the call over to Nick. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Okay. Thanks, Bette Jo. Good morning, everyone, and welcome again to AEP's third quarter 2018 earnings call. We just completed another financially strong quarter given positive weather results, continued economic growth, albeit moderated in most sectors of the economy, and continued resolution of regulatory related matters. The headlines for this quarter are not only that our board decided to raise the quarterly dividend by 8.1% to $0.67 a share earlier this week, we're also adjusting our 2018 guidance range upward from $3.75 to $3.95 per share to $3.88 to $3.98 per share. The economy in our service territory continues to grow mainly in oil and gas-related industries, with others such as chemical industries, primary metals, et cetera, are tempering because of tariffs and a strengthening U.S. dollar. Brian will cover that in more detail, but overall, AEP continues to deliver on its commitment of providing steady, consistent dividend growth commensurate with the long-term earnings growth expectation of 5% to 7%. As for the specifics for the quarter and the year-to-date, GAAP and operating earnings for third quarter 2018 came in at $1.17 per share and $1.26 per share, respectively, versus third quarter 2017 GAAP and operating earnings of $1.11 and $1.10 per share, respectively. This brings 2018 year-to-date GAAP and operating earnings to $3.17 per share and $3.23 per share, respectively, versus 2017 GAAP, and operating earnings of $3.07 per share and $2.82 per share, respectively. The difference between GAAP and operating for the quarter and for year-to-date 2018 are primarily due to an impairment taken related to the Racine Hydroelectric Plant, severance charges taken in response to announced plant closures, and economic hedging activities. This has been another very positive quarter financially and operationally that should bode well for ending the year in a positive fashion. Because of our belief that we are and continue to be on a firm 5% to 7% earnings trajectory buoyed by a strong base plan into the future, our board was very comfortable increasing the dividend by 8.1%, well within our 60% to 70% targeted payout ratio. Moving to the regulatory activity, at this point, the notable rate case activity really includes Oklahoma and APCo West Virginia. In late September, we filed another base case in Oklahoma at PSO, our third try to correct the chronic under earning situation in Oklahoma. This case has a requested net increase of $68 million with an ROE of 10.3%. We have proposed a performance-based rate mechanism that adjusts for certain customer satisfaction and quality of service metrics with the intent of reducing the regulatory lag while ensuring a positive customer experience. The proposed procedural schedule has now been set that provides for interim rates subject to refund going into effect in April of 2019. We are certainly hoping for a better outcome based upon the operational performance of PSO over the years, a financially healthy PSO would be well deserved. Regarding the West Virginia case that was filed back in early May, we received staff and other intervener testimony that while disappointing regarding adjustments such as a lower ROE, exclusion of certain known reasonable expenses after the test year and lower depreciation rates, we still believe there is an opportunity to enter into constructive settlement discussions to achieve a more reasonable outcome. Procedural schedules have been set in this case with an expected order in late February, with rates going into effect in March 2019. So now, I'll move to the equalizer chart. I'm going to hold off on a discussion of the premier regulated energy company until a little bit later. But as we look at the equalizer chart, I call it that because it sort of looks like it with the balls of different sizes of the companies, overall, we're seeing a 10.1% ROE. We generally project the ROE for our regulated segments combined to be at or near the 10% range. Given our geographic diversity, some companies will be up and others down. But as we have demonstrated by our historical performance, we're generally in that 9.5% to 10% range. We currently have six rate cases either recently completed or in process, and I talked about a couple of those that are in process, which will help some of the underperforming companies. I'll remind you, the ROEs are not weather normalized, so generally, across these companies, weather benefited the results. It's interesting to note though, when you look at the size of the bubbles and how they're changing with the passage of time, our Transco is now the second largest operating utility of AEP. And as you look at the diversity of the service territory, these balls are becoming more or less the same size. Six of them in the various jurisdictions are approximately the same size, so it bodes well for the diversity of the area. And then, as well, as sort of separated out APCo into West Virginia, Virginia. So, if you look at the jurisdictions, with the exception of PSO in Kentucky, they're around that $2.1 billion, $2.2 billion of average equity. So really, a good diverse footprint. But obviously, AEP Transco continues to grow considerably, and we'll be talking more about that at EEI as well. Regarding AEP Ohio, same thing we talked about last time. You have a green bubble and a gray bubble. And actually, the gray one is the one to really look at here. The green includes some global settlement items such as the RSR payments, the fuel, the PIR, and the 2014 SEET refund. So, it shows a return on equity of 14.1%. But the actual ROE for AEP Ohio is 12.5%. So, most of these legacy items will roll off by the end of the year with a small portion going into next year. APCo, the ROE for APCo at the end of third quarter was 9.9%. APCo's improvement ROE over second quarter of 2018 is primarily attributable to weather. APCo West Virginia, as I mentioned earlier, we filed a rate case there. And in Virginia, we still have the tri-annual rate reviews, and APCo's Virginia first tri-annual review will be in 2020, and will cover the 2017 to 2019 period. So, continuing to make progress with that. Kentucky, the ROE for Kentucky is continuing to grow. It's up to 9.2%. The January 2018 rate case is complete, helping drive the turnaround of the ROE. The change in rates during the year, along with better than expected weather, contributed to that as well. And also, the economic development activity, we had a two-prong approach. Obviously, the rate-making aspects in Kentucky, but the second part was associated with economic development. And we continue to do very well in terms of having construction jobs, permanent jobs being created in our service territory in that region. It's called our Appalachian Sky process, but it continues to advance. Obviously, it helps when the denominator grows as well from a kilowatt-hour perspective. I&M achieved an ROE of 12% at the end of third quarter 2018, and it continues to perform well in 2018, primarily driven by strong sales in all segments, favorable weather, disciplined OEM spending, and favorable one-time true-ups associated with the regulatory items. I&M is continuing its capital investment program in the nuclear distribution and transmission business units, with positive regulatory structures in place for all programs. So, really doing well from an I&M perspective. PSO, I talked earlier about PSO, it's now at 7.7% versus 6.5% at the end of second quarter. So weather is really reflected in there. We still have the considerable regulatory lag. And also, as you know, we filed an application for rate-making there in Oklahoma. So, more to come on that. SWEPCO, the ROE for SWEPCO at the end of third quarter was 7.4%, and the primary reason for the increase in ROE, which was at 6.8%, is weather. And the results also reflect a full quarter of rate relief implemented last year in May in our Louisiana and Texas jurisdictions, and also the 88 megawatts of Turk that was originally attributable to Arkansas is the issue around the ROE for SWEPCO. So, we'll continue to monitor that situation. AEP Texas, the ROE for AEP Texas at the end of third quarter 2018 was 8.8% versus 9.5% at the end of the second quarter. And while earnings have grown year-over-year, the reason for the declining ROE is primarily due to the timing of not only the annual filings that we make relative to capital investments, but also we have a lot of intensive capital investments going on in that territory. So, lag has become somewhat of a factor there, but we fully intend on catching up with the construction activity out there. AEP Transmission Holdco. The ROE for AEP Transmission at the end of third quarter was 10.4%, and that obviously reflects the ROE being lower mainly due to the reclassification of certain Transmission assets in July and August. And in addition, the East Transco's equity percentage of total capital is higher than filed (00:11:18) due to the recent changes in equity percent cap. So, it drives a higher equity balance, but unchanged revenues. So, we continue to do very well from the Transmission perspective and continue to invest heavily in that area as well. So, that ends that part of it. And so in a couple of weeks, I will have been the CEO of this company for seven years, working with a management team and a board that takes great pride in our track record of providing our shareholders consistent earnings and dividend growth, while de-risking the company and taking advantage of our industry-leading businesses such as Transmission. There has been a lot of talk externally that post-Wind Catcher, we would be tracking toward the lower end of the 5% to 7% growth rate. Frankly, I don't know where that comes from, and I just want to reiterate our 5% to 7% growth rate was not predicated on Wind Catcher and remains unchanged. That is exactly why our board approved an 8.1% dividend increase. As a premium regulated utility, we like to keep our dividend well within the 60% to 70% range. And as you can see, the adjustment puts us firmly in that range at 65%. And additionally, we're always trying to do better. So, I guess I'm left with \u2013 and last night, I was thinking about this \u2013 what sets AEP apart from our peers in the industry? Well, first of all, there's no overhang of large, intensive, risky capital projects. We just don't have that going on. Strong financials that support a robust capital and operating plan; we have thousands of smaller capital projects that are well within our control to execute and get recovery of. There's focus on deployment of capital and process efficiencies to bend the OEM curve, and we'll be talking about some of those examples of what we're doing at EEI. Diversity in our operating companies, which I mentioned earlier, with the regions of the country and diversity in customer makeup, we're about a third-third-third, industrial, commercial, industrial; and diversity in capital deployed in the various business units to mitigate risk. So, we have the optionality that others may not have; largest transmission provider by far. And you can see the continued, and we'll talk about that at EEI, the continued growth of Transmission with over half of our capital budget deployed on this business with a long runway ahead of us. And growing distribution companies with infrastructure replacement, resiliency, and revitalization through technology, that's going to be a continued growing wedge of the capital that we can deploy. And then, also, selective contracted renewables based upon credit quality, contract terms, and financial construction risk minimization. We have a real opportunity to invest as we see fit, but it also fits within the general framework of our overall capital strategy around the regulated T&D business. But we can be selective around contracted renewables, and we do that. And then finally, the culture of innovation and ingenuity, get things done through operational excellence and disciplined execution. That's what we've done year in and year out. You can look at the dividends in the last seven years, the way they've moved, you can look at the earnings, and it shows the consistency of this company. So, as we move into the rest of the year and into next year with more detail at EEI to confirm our strong position going forward, I want to leave you all with one of my wife's favorites. She played play this 45 single, some of you may not know what a 45 is, but it is a single that happens to be on the ballot for this year's Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Induction, Chaka Khan, and the lyrics from I Feel for You that says, baby, baby, when I look at you, I get a warm feeling inside. There's something about the things you do that keeps me satisfied. I feel that way about AEP. I bet you never \u2013 I bet Chaka Khan never thought this would be used in an earnings call, but AEP's clear intent over the years has been to be that dependable year in and year out investment that keeps our investors and customers satisfied, a premium regulated utility. More to come at EEI. Brian? Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Thank you, Nick, and good morning, everyone. I will take us through the third quarter and year-to-date financial results, provide some insight on loading the (00:15:31) economy, review our balance sheet and liquidity, and finish with a preview of what we will present at the EEI Conference. Let's begin on slide 6, which shows that operating earnings for the third quarter were $1.26 per share or $619 million compared to $1.10 per share or $543 million in 2017. Most of this year-over-year growth came from weather and recovery of incremental investment to serve our customers. Looking at the drivers by segment, earnings for Vertically Integrated Utilities were $0.71 per share, up $0.13. Rate changes were favorable by $0.09 per share. Weather was also a large driver this quarter with the $0.08 increase driven by warmer-than-normal temperatures this summer compared to cooler-than-normal temperatures last summer. These were partially offset by higher O&M of $0.06 per share. Reductions in wholesale load and a reduction in the non-service component of pension costs offset one another. The Transmission & Distribution Utilities segment earned $0.30 per share, up $0.01 from last year, primarily due to recovered incremental investment in Texas. The AEP Transmission Holdco segment was comparable to the third quarter of last year due to prior-period accounting adjustments which offset earnings from increased investment. Net plant grew by $1.6 billion or 26% since last September. Generation & Marketing and Corporate and Other were each up $0.01 from last year. Let's turn to slide 7 and review our year-to-date results. Operating earnings through September were $3.23 per share or $1.6 billion compared to $2.82 per share or $1.4 billion in 2017. Our regulated segments experienced growth for the year and, as expected, our competitive Generation & Marketing business was down due to last year's asset sales. Looking at the drivers by segment, operating earnings for Vertically Integrated Utilities were $1.74 per share, up $0.47, with the single largest driver being weather which added $0.32. The dramatic change in weather year-over-year was the largest swing in over 40 years. Successful implementation of rate changes added another $0.23. Other favorable items included higher transmission revenues and normalized load, as well as lower non-service pension costs and taxes. Offsetting these drivers were anticipated decreases in wholesale load, as well as increased O&M and depreciation expenses. Through September, the Transmission & Distribution utility segment earned $0.78 per share, up $0.02 from last year. Favorable drivers included higher rate changes, weather and normalized load, which were partially offset by higher depreciation. The AEP Transmission Holdco segment contributed $0.57 per share, up $0.01 from last year. This growth in earnings reflected our return on incremental rate base, which was mostly offset by minimal formula rate true-ups this year compared to the larger one in 2017. This was expected due to the change in methodology to forward-looking test years last year. Generation & Marketing produced earnings of $0.21 per share, down $0.04 from last year mostly due to the sale of assets. Finally, Corporate and Other was down $0.05 per share from last year due to higher interest expense and prior year investment gains. We are pleased with our results and are confident in raising and narrowing our 2018 annual operating earnings guidance range to $3.88 per share to $3.98 per share. Now, let's turn to slide 8 for an update on normalized load growth. Starting in the lower right chart, normalized retail sales increase by three-tenths of a percent for the quarter and were up 1.2% year-to-date. Even though the growth moderated in the third quarter, the year-to-date load performance is still 1% above expectations for the year. In fact, every operating company experienced normalized load growth in retail sales this year with the exception of Kentucky Power. Moving clockwise, industrial sales increased by 2.4% for the quarter and were up 2.6% year-to-date. Industrial sales growth has been strong for over a year now. However, the mix of growth across industrial sectors has started to shift. Through the first half of the year, growth was balanced across most industries and operating companies. In the third quarter, growth was dominated by the oil and gas sectors, while the remaining sectors moderated. The shift in industrial sales growth was driven by higher energy prices, the impact of metals, tariffs and a stronger dollar. In the upper left chart, normalized residential sales declined by 0.8% for the quarter but remained up 0.7% for the year. For the year to date comparison, normalized usage per customer was 0.2% higher than last year. Finally in the upper right chart, commercial sales decrease by 0.5% in the third quarter, but are up 0.2% for the year. Commercial sales were up in the T&D's utility segment, but down in Vertically Integrated Utilities. Now, let's move to Slide 9 and review the status of our regional economies. As shown in the upper left chart, GDP growth in AEP's service territory was 2.6% for the quarter, which is 0.4% below the U.S. Within the last six months, the U.S. economy has eclipsed that of AEP's service territory. The upper right chart shows the gap in employment growth is narrowing between AEP's service territory in the U.S. While the U.S. has experienced stable job growth over the past year, the job market within AEP's footprint has continued to improve. For the quarter, job growth in AEP's territory was 1.2% with higher growth in the west. The sectors that added the most jobs this quarter were professional and business services, education and health services, and leisure and hospitality. The final chart at the bottom shows that income growth within AEP's footprint has not kept pace with the U.S. in recent months. For the quarter, personal income growth for AEP was 1.5% below the U.S. Income growth is the key driver for residential and commercial sales growth. Overall, 2018 has been a strong year for the economy and AEP service territory. The boost to incomes from tax reform and a robust job market created momentum through the first nine months of the year and will cause our load to finish above forecast for 2018. Now, let's move on to slide 10 and review the company's capitalization and liquidity. Our debt to total capital ratio remained flat during the quarter at 56.8%. Our FFO to debt ratio was solidly in the Baa1 range at 19.2%, and our net liquidity stood at about $2.3 billion, supported by our revolving credit facility. Net liquidity increased from the prior quarter due to less commercial paper outstanding and recent proceeds from a long-term debt issuance. Last week, we amended and upsized AEP's core revolving credit facility from $3 billion to $4 billion, and extended it by one year to June 2022. The increase in size supports our robust capital program. Our Qualified Pension Funding improved to 104%, and our OPEB funding improved to 135%. For both plans, the funded status improved to a rising discount rate that led to a decrease in liabilities, which more than offset flat asset returns, benefit payments and other administrative costs. Let's try and wrap this up on slide 11 and get to your questions. The strong results we have delivered year-to-date and our confidence in our plan for the remainder of the year allow us to raise and narrow the operating earnings guidance range to $3.88 per share to $3.98 per share. Our message at EEI will be that we are a premium regulated utility delivering 5% to 7% earnings growth and dividends growing in line with earnings. Our plan has line of sight transparency to growth, and has greatly reduced regulatory and execution risk. We will provide detailed drivers for earnings by segment and updates to our capital expenditure and financing plans. We look forward to seeing many of you in San Francisco in a couple of weeks. With that, I will turn the call over to the operator for your questions. Operator : Thank you. And our first question will come from the line of Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good morning, and thanks for taking my questions. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Good morning, Stephen. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: So, Nick, I love the Chaka Khan reference. And I'm going to throw... Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: (00:24:24) in the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame this year. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: ...another reference out there from Chaka Khan, Tell Me Something Good. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: So, I guess, the wind investment opportunity in your geographies appear to be very good. And I was just curious at a high level, sort of how should we think about the evolution of the potential for additional wind opportunities that might be smaller than Wind Catcher but still very large? What kind of steps or what kind of cadence should we think about in terms of incremental wind opportunities? Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Yeah. So, actually, that's probably one of the lessons learned from Wind Catcher, being so intensive and the transmission being pretty intensive as well. We're looking at obviously, smaller segments, smaller wind farms with smaller transmission, multiple areas. We've already started that process. We're also, in parallel with that, doing \u2013 really refocusing our integration resource plans and evolve into various jurisdictions that support that approach. Most of it, you're going to find \u2013 we'll show more about that at EEI. But basically, it's showing renewables. But we also have to be mindful of the political situation and \u2013 in each of our state jurisdictions and the resources that they're looking for. So, you're going to see resource plans that develop around wind resources, solar resources, perhaps some storage, but also some natural gas. So you'll continue to see that kind of development. And as I said, it will be smaller capacity segments focused on various jurisdictions. And we've already started that process. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: That's great. That makes sense. And then just switching over to transmission, just want to make sure I was clear. Given the FERC announcement last week, I guess I didn't see any significant impacts to you all from the FERC activity on transmission, but just wanted to make sure I wasn't missing a nuance or how you all thought about that. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: No. You're not missing anything. The settlement that was done in the east is pretty consistent with the range that came out of those cases. And I really believe even, there's some discussion of incentives. Incentives are being dealt with the same fashion. The only one we get is the RTO incentive. So, I really believe that discussion, while still initial, I still think it will be supportive of transmission investments. So, we see no change. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: That's awesome. That's all I have. Thank you. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Okay. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Praful Mehta with Citigroup. Your line is open. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Good morning, Praful. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi, guys. Morning. Thanks so much for taking my question. So, I guess, maybe we start with the transmission side and CapEx on the transmission side. Given the support that you probably get with the ROEs, and clearly, there has been some change on the leadership at FERC side, but just wanted to understand what do you see in terms of the opportunity set on the transmission side. You've clearly had a huge impact on that opportunity, but is there incremental opportunity you see there and how do you see that progressing? Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Well, certainly, transmission \u2013 I mean, we're already tracking over $3 billion a year in capital investment in transmission. And certainly, with Transource and other opportunities out there, you may see other projects come into play that are incremental. But obviously, we want to be very mindful of where we're investing. We have plant retirements that are occurring, they will encourage more transmission investment. So, we're going to continue to push the organization, the Transmission organization to do as much as we possibly can around capital deployment. So, there's always opportunities. And also, it has to be in the context of \u2013 the distribution side is growing as well. And certainly, we want to make sure that we're doing the right thing there, too. But as far as transmission is concerned, as I said, really no end in sight in terms of our ability to invest in transmission. And actually, the reasons for transmission investment continue to change all the time. We're seeing further retirements. Obviously, some of those are ours. But also, with \u2013 I think there's no doubt, even when you think about the climate change aspects, the ESG activity, all those types of things that are occurring is going to continue to push for clean energy resources, and that means transmission as well. We have a lot of resources that are attached and that we enable through transmission, and that will continue to grow. So we'll have more discussion on that at EEI as well. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Got you. That's great color, and we'd love to hear a little bit more in terms of how to quantify that opportunity set as well at EEI, I'm sure. So, we'll come to that. And then, I guess, secondly, in terms of contracted renewables, just wanted to get a sense for how that is going. You're seeing a number of players continue to invest in renewables. The returns probably continue to get competitive. Where do you see that opportunity set on the unregulated renewable investment side? Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Yes. So we look at that a little differently than others perhaps because we are accentuated by transmission and because \u2013 largest transmission by far, that's where a lot of our investment goes, but also the regulated operating companies continue to grow as well. We can afford to be very selective about these projects. There's a lot of projects out there. Some of them have shorter duration, 5, 10 years. That's not what we're really interested in. When we look at our tenure of these contracts, we're looking for long-term contracts with creditworthy counterparties, particularly utilities, which we've done across the country. We're in 32 states now. And also, the actual development and construction risk versus financial risk, we're mostly in the financial risk category at this point in time, and that's pretty meaningful in terms of mitigation risk. So, I would say, we're fully prepared to go as deep as we want to go in that, but we don't have a requirement to be out there everywhere trying to soak up every deal regardless of what it may mean from a risk profile perspective. So, Chuck, is \u2013 I think, is it $750 million of the $1 billion that we had allocated before? And we'll have more on that at EEI as well. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: All right. Great. Really appreciate it, guys. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Good morning, Steve. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Hey. Good morning. Still getting over the Chaka Khan. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Another person wanted me (00:32:09) to use Backstreet Boys, and I couldn't get there. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Yeah. Okay. The Ohio tax order yesterday seemed to be relatively flexible. Just \u2013 I think you had already resolved, but could you just give any thoughts on your color on that? Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Yeah. It's very much in line with what we had anticipated. So, like so many of the other orders \u2013 and we have some detail on this in the appendix of the release \u2013 it's going very smoothly wherever we've had these occasions. And the range of flowbacks that we have, have also been very reasonable. When we talked to you early in the year, we kind of assumed flowbacks happening very quickly. But I think just about everywhere we've been, the range is 2 to like 18 years, with most of it being in the 10- to 15-year range. It's been very \u2013 and people are being reasonable and Ohio's order was just another instance of that. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. And then just in terms of the EEI disclosures on the CapEx and the financing plan, that will be out for the kind of four- to five-year period, not just for 2019, right? Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: The CapEx plan will be out for five years, and I think the financing plan, we're going to go out three. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. And then just on the dividend, which was great, just in terms of from here, we should probably assume that now that you're at the midpoint of your payout range, you'll kind of grow it in line with earnings growth from here. Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Yeah, that's correct. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. Great. Thank you. Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Yeah. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good morning, guys. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Good morning, Jonathan. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah, Nick. Well, Nick, I'm recovering from learning that I'm one of the only people on my team that knows what a 45 is. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Yeah, yeah. I know. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: I was a (00:34:12) little sad this morning. Could I just \u2013 back to sort of where Stephen (00:34:18) was going, you talked about needing to kind of revise IRPs in the states before you can kind of come with the sort of post-Wind Catcher, smaller footprint, smaller transmission type deals. What's the timeframe for that? Is this something you see playing out? Yeah, well, we'll have some more clarity in the next couple of quarters or is it going to go deeper into 2019 before you really flush (00:34:44) that out? Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: No, you'll see more clarity soon. And I just want to make clear to you that we already have resource plans filed in the jurisdictions that have renewables in them. I think you're going to see more definition and more focus around what the alternatives are, and also being respectful to what the individual states want to see. Those will start coming out as early as December, and then they'll continue to flow out during 2019. So, you're going to see several first passes here probably within the first quarter of 2019 and toward the end of this year. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Can you give us a sense of where you'll start in terms of \u2013 was there an order to how these are teed up from a regulatory schedule standpoint? Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Yeah. Each day is different, but I think the first one to come up is... Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Arkansas. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: ...Arkansas and then Louisiana. And obviously, they were supportive of Wind Catcher, so there's some real opportunity there to really fashion it to what they're looking for. But each one is different from a scheduling perspective, and each one of them have different views of what resources are applied. And so, we're going to have to make sure that it's mapped toward that. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. But we're not talking about a sort of IRP do-over type thing (00:36:16)? Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: No, no, no. I think it's more of a more refinement, but also there's things we know today that we didn't know even before Wind Catcher. And certainly, gas forecast will change and those types of things, and the way we present things is likely to change as well to where we're being much more of a partner with our commissions and the states in terms of what they're looking for. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, great. Thank you. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Yeah. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Good morning, Julien. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey, good morning. Can you hear me? Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Yeah, I hear you fine. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Excellent. Hey, thank you. So I wanted to go back a little bit to some of the updates expected here at EEI as you think about CapEx and kind of reconcile that with the cash flows. Obviously, you've had a few updates through the course of the year. Can you give us a little bit of a sense or maybe a little bit of a preview on how you're thinking about cash flows given some of the updates year-to-date on tax reform and some of the excess \u2013 refunds, if you think about that? I know you have a little table there and even in the latest deck here. Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Yeah, Julien. So we showed at last year's EEI for 2020 meeting, an incremental about $400 million in equity over the dividend reinvestment program. If we were to show another year, I'd anticipate showing another need just like that in 2021. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got it. Okay. And that is inclusive of the latest tax reform refunds, et cetera, that you've been able to secure for this year, right? Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: That's correct. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got it. Okay. Excellent. Then secondly, turning over to Oklahoma here, obviously, you filed a PSO case and you've talked a little bit about some of the levers you might have over time as you think about that situation and your ownership or not. Is there a potential where you split it apart, Transmission versus Distribution, when you think about ownership and the different jurisdictions here? I mean, maybe can you talk a little bit to the jurisdictional issues, too, just as you think about your desire to be involved in Oklahoma? Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Yeah. So, well, first of all, I certainly am looking toward a positive outcome in Oklahoma. I think there's some confusion. We have the Oklahoma Transco and certainly PSO, they're two separate utilities. But, at the same time, I think it'd be somewhat difficult to think of them independently because certainly, PSO and Transco is \u2013 Transco is new transmission, but it's transmission that's within the PSO customer side of things, and it's not all that way. And I think there's a lot of confusion even from maybe the commission perspective and others from what I've read from the investment analysts' reports. The Transco at PSO, it is an Oklahoma Transco, but it invests in transmission based on what SPP requirements are and in terms of what the customer load requirements are for PSO. Only the cost in the Transco that go to Oklahoma customers are actually ascribed to Oklahoma customers. And there's this view that we can short change PSO because we get higher ROEs in the Oklahoma Transco. Well, that is really very, very small. I mean, if you were to take the Oklahoma Transco along with PSO and look at the rate structures associated with that, the impact of the Transco is really only like 28 basis points. So \u2013 and I think some people think that we can have 6.5% ROE at PSO, and we're getting 10.5% to 11% in Transco that, okay, that's fine overall, but it's not because the rate base is much bigger from a PSO perspective and only incremental transmission is in the Transco. And when you account for that, it's not like we're taking earnings and soften them off to the corporate parent. It's that the investment made in the Transco in earnest of (00:41:04) the benefit of AEP shareholders, but also, the PSO returns and investment made within PSO that's also regulated goes to the AEP shareholders as well, any earnings and returns associated with that. So, this notion that we can average it out and everything's fine doesn't make sense. And so I think we've got to get sort of past that. As far as PSO's future is concerned, we obviously have been \u2013 and we've said time and time again that we can't have a chronic under-recovery for years and years because obviously, our shareholders are expecting investments to be made in places where we can get very positive returns. In the other state jurisdictions, that's possible. Even in Kentucky, it's come up considerably. PSO in Oklahoma remains that single situation that we have that really needs to be corrected. And I think we presented a very positive case to say that, okay, we're to provide great quality service to our customers and we're committed to that. But obviously, on the other side, we need to be able to invest and invest and get a decent recovery for it. And that's what performance-based rate-making does for you also in terms of bringing that investment closer to \u2013 the recovery closer to when the investment's made. That's a natural occurrence. And I say, I think, we've got to get that message across in all of these rate filings. But it'd be hard to separate the two and do something different, and I really don't want to go there at this point. I want to get through this case. And then we look at the situation of the tax basis and leakage and everything else associated with issues of sales, and do we actually have a use for that. So, \u2013 and you're going to see more at EEI. I think there's one of the slides about sources and uses that sort of gives our thinking in terms of what we're looking at. So, I'd rather reserve a lot of that discussion for EEI, but also, as far as PSO is concerned, reserve that discussion to later, certainly after the rate case. And keep in mind, too, that we have a second corporate headquarters there in Oklahoma. Tulsa has about 618 employees there that are not PSO employees. They're AEP corporate employees. And so, that would also have to be managed in the context of whatever the disposition of PSO would be going forward. So, there's a lot of things to think about from that perspective, but I really don't want to go there until we fully understand what our role is in Oklahoma. And I think the commission is going to make a definite statement on that this time around. (00:44:31) that. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got it. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Yeah. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Actually... Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: (00:44:34) answer than what you probably asked for, but (00:44:37). Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Indeed. Quick follow-up on the renewables piece just real quickly. How do you see the approval process and demonstration of need for the RFP filing in Ohio? Specifically, how do you think about this given potential changes in PUCO and the wider gubernatorial change? Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Yeah. So, I would suspect \u2013 we're following what the framework has been set up to get these approvals for the renewables. And certainly, a change in administration could have an impact, but I think the path is already set. It really is up to the Commission now. We've gone out for bid, we've done what we need to do, and that's at least for 400 megawatts. There's still 500 megawatts to go, and that's probably wind-related resources. So, we still have an opportunity to continue to progress along that path. And I don't really see an impact in terms of \u2013 or a change in the thought process of the Commission itself. But we've got credible projects out there. We presented a filing that did not have us participating in those two projects of BPA, but given the use of our balance sheet, certainly, there was a factor that we applied to it that included provisions from our financial perspective to ensure that we remain neutral from a capital structure standpoint. So \u2013 and we made that decision and we'll make that decision on any future PPAs. And whether we're actually investing or not investing, I think that goes to \u2013 it goes to the capital discipline that we have of our threshold of returns and risk associated with any capital investment we make. So, I think we manage it pretty well from that perspective. So, we'll wait and see what the Commission thinks about the two that have been filed. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Excellent. Thank you very much. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Yeah. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Good morning, Greg. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Thanks. Good morning. You're in my era with Chaka Khan, for sure. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Yeah. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : And so... Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Unfortunately, we're all in the same era or just about. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Yeah. Well, they don't make any good music anymore, do they? Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Yeah. No, they don't. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Not as good as the old days. But the question on the dividend that Steve asked, I just want to be clear because I had asked this question of you guys maybe a year or two ago. You've moved your balance sheet into a really pristine position. And you've indicated to Steve that sort of this 8% move was not indicative of a desire to consistently grow the dividend a nudge ahead of the earnings guidance. So, as you think about that, is it one and done for any good reason other than \u2013 or, I mean, could you theoretically... Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Yeah. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : ...continue to grow it at 8% and be in a strong balance sheet position, or is the cash flow profile, as you move out three, four, five years, in a place where you sort of meet at a place where you really would be penny-wise, pound-foolish to nudge ahead of the earnings growth? Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Yeah. I wouldn't \u2013 well, I would say it a little differently. I mean, obviously, we've been consistent about the message that our dividends grow commensurate with our earnings. And I think we got \u2013 and we really also feel very strongly that a regulated utility should be in a healthy range within that 60% to 70%. And it started to wag a little bit, and we really felt like some of it was catch-up but also, some of it was confidence. And I think as the board looks at the dividend policy in the future, we're going to continue to focus on what the earnings profile of the company looks like going forward, and we'll be very transparent about that at EEI, and give you some sense of where the dividend will go as well. Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Greg, we had previously announced guidance for 2019 for operating earnings of $4 to $4.20 per share. And that move that the board made earlier this week puts our dividend payout ratio squarely in the middle of what we previously announced of 60% to 70%, and the move that they made puts it exactly at 65%. And I think as Nick said, that's just the board in expressing its confidence in our ability to grow earnings over time. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : So, I get that, guys. I guess what I'm asking is a little bit more nuanced perhaps in that given how strong the balance sheet is and how good you've been in terms of being stewards of that balance sheet. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Yeah. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : If you continue to raise it a notch faster than the midpoint of your earnings growth target, you might be at the higher end of the payout ratio target in several years, but you'd still be comfortably in your credit metric profile. So, is that outside of the realm of possible? Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: I think our policy has been from a board perspective, and this comes from the board obviously, that we'll grow commensurate with earnings. Now, okay, so \u2013 and you also have to look at the use of capital. We have plenty of places to put capital, and I think there's probably going to be more definition around that because Brian has just mentioned that we'll be showing five years of capital going forward. That will give you some insight in terms of what the earnings capability of the company is going forward. And then you can take from that earnings where the dividend policy will be. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Great. Okay. And one last question, and perhaps you'll (00:51:09) until we get to San Francisco but when we look out five years from now, is your generation fleet, based on your plans, going to be substantially incrementally decarbonized from where it is today? Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Yeah. Actually, I think we get \u2013 as far as coal-fired generation, we're in the 30-something-percent range. We've already gone from 65% to I think it's 51%, and it's going to go even further because we've already announced closures of Oklaunion and Conesville. And as you move forward, you're going to see continued activity in that regard, but also, at the same time, our fleet itself is continuing to grow from a clean energy perspective that's added on to it as well. So, that's really what we're looking at in the future. So, as we transform our generation fleet, we're going to be in the range of 36% coal \u2013 at least down 36% from a coal perspective, up 2% on natural gas, no change on nuclear, up 29% on solar and hydro, wind, and then energy efficiency up 5%. So, you're seeing a very different view of what really is changing from a generation fleet to resources. And those resources include transmission, and they also include the efficiencies within the grid itself that have yet to really been \u2013 you haven't seen that capital picture yet. So, it's going to continue to change dramatically. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : That's \u2013 even without Wind Catcher, that's impressive. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Yeah. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Thanks. I look forward to seeing you, guys. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Yes. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Turnure with JP Morgan. Your line is open. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Morning, Christopher. Christopher Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Good morning, guys. Could you talk a little bit about the O&M trajectory year-to-date versus your original plan, and any of the drivers that might be underlying that? Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Yeah. So we're going to be up a little bit as we were out with the weather being what it's come in at. Last year, we significantly throttled back O&M in the fourth quarter. This year, given where we've gotten ahead with weather, we've been able to move some things into 2018 from 2019. And so, between shifting employee-related expenses, some things we've taken on forestry, we're going to be up versus what we had previously announced at EEI for last year. Christopher Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And can you give us a sense as to how much of that differential versus your original plan was due to pulling forward O&M from 2019? Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: A relatively small portion, less than $0.10 per share. Christopher Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And then my second question is as you look out over the next five years and think about your tax appetite and level of just cash taxes in general, kind of how you think about that? And does that position you well versus your competitors for renewable projects, and position you well even within any regulated renewable projects that you'd like to do in terms of the costs that you can offer your customers? Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Yeah. So, we do have tax appetite for both the regulated side of the business and the competitive side of the business. And we anticipate utilizing that tax appetite to the point where we anticipate having a cash effective tax rate on a federal basis of about 5% for the foreseeable future Christopher Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Great. Thank you. Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Your line is open. Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Good morning, Paul. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Good morning. How are you? How are you doing? Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Just fine. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Really, just sort of one question here that I have left, and that is the ROE case in New England. I was wondering how you guys were looking at that in the context of the FERC ROE settlement that you guys came up with. And just any thoughts you have about the, I guess it's kind of a proposal, but whatever they're \u2013 what they're proposing in New England which seems to be a new policy in general? And just how you see that in the context of what you guys settled on? Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: So, Paul, when we take that methodology and apply it to our facts, we come up with an ROE that is very, very similar to what we settled at. One of the other benefits that we got from the settlement was the opportunity to increase our equity layer from 50% to 55%. And so, even though the ROE is right on top of where we would calculate it given the New England transmission owners' orders, we think we end up even better than that given the increase in the equity layer. And then, of course, on top of that, we had, as Nick was talking about earlier, the incentive for being in an RTO. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : So, when you look at it, just to make sure I understand, you see your base ROE \u2013 you think that the new proposed numbers apply to your situation, would have come in pretty close to where you are... Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Yeah. We're in great (00:56:52) there. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : ...where you settled on? Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Yes. Very similar. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. Awesome. Thanks so much. Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Okay. Thanks, Paul. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes \u2013 thank you. And that will be from the line of Ali Agha with SunTrust. Your line is open. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thank you. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Almost missed you, Ali. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Yes. Good morning. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Yeah. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: One thing I wanted to clarify, Brian. Back on the second quarter call, you had laid out your 2021 CapEx. And now, if I'm hearing you right, at EEI, you will lay out a five-year look. So presumably, that gets us to 2023. One, I wanted to confirm that. And then secondly, should we also expect that your transmission earnings outlook, which currently is out till 2020, that you'll also extend that out to 2023 as well? Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Nope. We're going to add a year to that. So, let me confirm that we are going to show five years of CapEx, and we'll show an additional year on the transmission outlook. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: I got you. Okay. And then secondly, Nick, you talk about having your sort of blended portfolio ROE somewhere in the 10% range, which is obviously where you're tracking right now. But in actuality, I just wanted to confirm, when you look at what your authorized ROEs are across your jurisdictions and you compare that to the 10.1% LTM ROE that you're running, is there any regulatory lag in the system? And some of it may just be fictional and historical, but just to get a sense of the difference in authorized and actual earned. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Yeah. There is a regulatory lag, but also there's \u2013 and we sort of position our cases where they need to be done. In some cases, I mean like AEP Texas, it's a lower ROE because we're investing heavily, but it's a really good recovery mechanism in Texas. The same is true with the transmission. And then, we have the formula based rates in various jurisdictions, and Arkansas has formula-based rates now, and certainly, we're trying to get that at PSO to bring that more concurrent. But there is regulatory lag in there, and we're trying to minimize that as much as possible to bring up the effect of ROEs. That's a critical component of what we're working with our regulators on. And as far as looking into the future, you're going to have AEP Ohio, that portion dropped off. So the legacy parts of AEP Ohio, the RSR and the PIR and all that kind of stuff, that's going to drop off. But at the same time, we expect other jurisdictions to be picking up. So, \u2013 including PSO. And so, that's part of it as well. So, it's probably more convoluted than -you can't look at each one of them deterministically because we invest differently in each company at different times, and timing has a lot to do with it, and the O&M spend for various activities. But generally speaking across the board, we always try to get to that 10%. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: I got you. Last question, I also want to just clarify, at EEI, in addition to extending the time period, did I hear you folks right that given the opportunities that you're seeing, whether it's renewables or transmission, et cetera, that there's also an opportunity and expectation that the absolute amounts of investment also likely goes up as well? Just clarifying if I heard that right. Nicholas K. Akins - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: So we're going to talk about that at EEI. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. But that was not what you had signaled in your comments currently? Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: We're going to \u2013 we'll give you the full update at EEI, Ali. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: I got you. Okay. Thank you. Brian X. Tierney - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And, speakers, I'd like to turn it back over to you for any closing comments. Bette Jo Rozsa - American Electric Power Co., Inc.: I'll take that. Thank you for joining us on today's call, everyone. And as always, the IR team will be available to answer any additional questions you may have. Cynthia, would you please give the replay information? Operator : Thank you.

At this time, all lines are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would like to now turn the conference over to our host Managing Director of Investor Relations, Bette Jo Rozsa. Please go ahead. Bette Jo Rozsa : Thank you, Salina. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the fourth quarter 2018 earnings call for American Electric Power. Thank you for taking the time to join us today. Our earnings release, presentation slides, and related financial information are available on our website at aep.com. Today, we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors. Our presentation also includes references to non-GAAP financial information. Please refer to the reconciliation of the applicable GAAP measures provided in the appendix of today's presentation. Joining me this morning for opening remarks are Nick Akins, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Tierney, our Chief Financial Officer. We will take your questions following their remarks. I will now turn the call over to Nick. Nicholas Akins : Okay. Thanks, Bette Jo. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for AEP's Fourth Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. As we move into the New Year and look back at 2018, we are pleased to report solid earnings for the quarter and for the year. Favorable weather continued into the fourth quarter, with the economy remaining healthy albeit tempered later in the year by the negative impacts of trade tariffs issues and the strong dollar. With that said, 2018 was the strongest normalized load growth since 2011. We continue to see customer counts pick up and load growth continue, and primarily the oil and gas sectors and residential sales growth as well. Overall good, but we'll keep a close watch on the sector growth in the economy and the customer load growth makeup. As you all no, we earlier, during third quarter 2018, revised our guidance for operating earnings from $3.75 to $3.95 per share to $3.88 to $3.98 per share and came in for the year solidly in the upper end of the revised guidance at $3.95 per share. We're very pleased with how our employees continue to work to provide a better customer experience while being dependably consistent to our shareholders on delivering these results. 2018 was clearly has been a great year, but I am even more pleased with the track record over the last 8 years of what we have achieved. Brian and I and the rest of the team take this very personally and see this as one of the hallmarks of the emerging brand of AEP. So let's take a look at the actual numbers for 2018, starting with the financial performance for the fourth quarter. We came in with GAAP earnings of $0.74 per share versus $0.81 per share in 2017 and operating earnings of $0.72 per share versus $0.85 per share in 2017. This brought the year-to-date 2018 total GAAP earnings to $3.90 per share versus $3.89 per share in 2017 and year-to-date 2018 total operating earnings to $3.95 per share versus $3.68 per share in 2017. The difference between GAAP and operating earnings primarily being generation plant-related impairments and tax adjustments. We also concluded rate cases in five states as a pretty heavy year from that perspective, Indiana, Michigan, Kentucky, Oklahoma and Texas. AEP also filed rate cases in two states, West Virginia and Oklahoma, which will conclude earlier this year. Tax reform-related activities were also major regulatory undertakings in the AEP state jurisdiction as well. All are proceeding well in order to generally ranging from primarily excess unprotected ADIT refunds being amortized over various periods or applied against depreciation or various riders [ph]. Almost all of the states have concluded orders reflecting these adjustments, and we did not expect any additional impacts during 2019. Moreover, even with the headwinds described earlier in an increasing interest rate environment, AEP continues to outperform the S&P 500 Electric Utilities Index and the S&P 500 over the 1 year, 3 year and 5 year periods. Again, as I said last year at this time, the very definition of a premium regulated utility. So great performance in the past, but the recognition of one of this year's Rock Hall of Fame inductees Janet Jackson and the title of one of hers songs What Have You Done for Me Lately, let's talk about what we see in 2019. AEP's operating earnings per share guidance range for 2019 is $4 to $4.20 per share. As we had said during EEI financial last November and continue to say with the capital plan, we've outlined for the next 5 years, including $6.5 billion in 2019, our focus on disciplined capital allocation among our businesses and additional opportunities to grow renewables beyond our financial plan, we have been very disappointed to not ultimately be in the upper range of our 5% to 7% growth rate. Additionally, I will reiterate the regulated renewables opportunities represented by the various integrated resource plans filed in our state jurisdictions are not included in our capital forecast of upside potential certainly exist. We also continue to work to bend the O&M curve through efficiencies, process automation and digitization as well as implement technologies to drive efficiencies while improving the customer experience. Regarding the renewables opportunities, we have filed integrated resource plans and RFPs with all of the SWEPCO and PSO state jurisdictions representing up to 2,200 megawatts of wind resources. On March 1, Vizard's [ph] new focused on ownership of these facilities primarily due to factors such as balance sheet optimization, scalability opportunities, deliverability and various other risks versus of the use of PPAs. We will file the results of the RFP process in August, and each state regulatory circumstance will determine the path forward. Our view is that all construction will be completed by the end of 2021, thereby taking advantage of the 80% PTC value and contribute to earnings starting in 2022. The Ohio 400-megawatt solar review process continues, which is part of the 900 megawatts renewables contemplated for AEP Ohio. Hearings are continuing this week and the next week regarding the question of need for these facilities really focused on a strict definition based on capacity or other broader stated issues regarding renewables, job creation, state economic development which governor DeWine is very interested in and others. It is interesting to note low-income customer support us in this case because of the accessibility of renewable resources that would not otherwise be available. This position goes directly to the message that utilities are inherently equipped to derive the scale to reduce costs and the ability to provide universal access to these types of resources and technologies. After the hearings, we will continue to push this process forward to resolve this important question for Ohio. As far as rate cases are concerned, we contemplate - we completed a heavy load of rate cases in 2018 as, I mentioned earlier, in the 5 states, and we await the finalization of the already filed West Virginia and Oklahoma rate cases soon this year. We will also be filing rate cases in Arkansas and Texas as soon as well. Regarding the West Virginia rate case, we have already filed a settlement agreement among the major parties including the staff that is effective in March, so we should be in order soon from the commission. Regarding Oklahoma, as you all know, this is our third try to receive a positive outcome in Oklahoma where we have been locally underachieving from a financial viewpoint while providing excellent customer satisfaction operational performance. Interveners and staff testimony has been filed, and we believe our tenor of where we stand at this point is even keeled with some bright spots of at least recognizing law perhaps has concerned with the concept of performance-based ratemaking for various reasons, there may be options for distribution riders or forward test years that could alleviate the pressure of regulatory lag. The ROEs filed by the parties were slightly higher than the proposals from last case we went through but are still among the lowest in the nation. As Oklahoma really open for business and economic development has renewed Oklahoma government expresses, we'll find out. We're always open to settlement discussions with the parties to resolve these different issues, and we have a long way to go. And in no doubt we'll come down to the Oklahoma Corporation Commission making the ultimate call. I would ask them as our referee to make the right call and not be like the NEC championship game. This is important from the perspective of the integrity of the regulatory process in Oklahoma, the help of PSO and its stability to invest in the state and from an economic development standpoint that concerns the significant AEP presence, not PSO, but AEP of over 600 employees centralized in Tulsa. We expect interim rates in Oklahoma to be in place in April and an order from the commission soon thereafter. So now I'll turn it over to the equalizer chart and talk about some of the state actions here. Overall, the regulated operations ROE is currently 9.7% versus 10.1% last quarter. I'll remind you that we generally project the ROE for our regulated segments combined to be in the 9.5% to 10% range. The primary reason for the slight decline from quarter four versus quarter three was the increase in O&M in fourth quarter this year versus the lower spend as we had very tempered weather last year and in the fourth quarter. So some adjustments were made there. As far as AEP Ohio is concerned, the ROE for AEP Ohio at the end of the fourth quarter 2018 was 14.5%. The primary driver is obviously continue to be some of the adjustments that were made previously, the RSR, the fuel, the PIR, those kinds of adjustments that are going to roll off by the end of - some will roll off by the end of last year and some will roll off toward the middle part this year. We expect to see the ROEs come closer to the authorized range as we go forward. APCo. The ROE for APCo at the end of the fourth quarter 2018 was 9.4% compared to 9.9% at the end of third quarter. APCo's changing ROE from third quarter is primarily attributable to higher storm restoration expense during the fourth quarter and a tax true-up. And again, I will remind you there's a settlement agreement that will become effective in March 2019. In Virginia, APCo's first triangle review is in 2020 and will cover the 2017 and 2019 periods. For the first triangle case for rate adjustment clauses in the period December 2018 to November 2020, the Virginia corporation issuing authorized the 9.42% ROE, which will be the reference going into the period to determine whether APCo's Virginia earnings for the 3-year period or within the allowed range. The proved ROE for West Virginia is 9.75% right now. In Kentucky, the ROE for Kentucky at the end of the fourth quarter was 9% compared to 9.2% at the end of third quarter. Kentucky Power continued to perform well in 2018 from a 5.1% ROE at the end of 2017 to the 9.0% ROE at the end of 2018. So great progress in Kentucky. I&M. The ROE in I&M at the end of the fourth quarter was 11.4% versus 12% in the third quarter. I&M posted strong results in 2018 primarily driven by favorable weather. This was O&M spending and onetime true-ups associated with the regulatory items. Favorable rate reviews in both Indiana and Michigan also contributed to the strong year. And then as far as PSO is concerned, the ROE we've talked about previously is 6.9% versus 7.7% at the end of third quarter. PSO's ROE continues to improve over last year, which was 5.92%, but was slightly down in the fourth quarter mainly due to unfavorable normalized retail margins. However, the ROE continues to be challenged, primarily because of ongoing regulatory lag, and as you know, we have a rate case filed there to resolve some of those issues. SWEPCO, their ROE at the end of fourth quarter was 6.5% versus 7.4% at the end of third quarter. Primary reason for the decrease in the ROE is the impact of the most recent Texas rate case. The company recorded $31 million in December 2017 that related back to an implementation date of May 2017. SWEPCO's ROE continues to be affected by the Arkansas share of the FERC [ph] plant. It's not in retail rates. This impacts ROE by about 135 basis points. SWEPCO also had contracts expire with certain wholesale customers during the period as well, so that has an effect. We plan to file an Arkansas base rate case this year, so we'll continue with that to try to address the SWEPCO's issues. AEP Texas at the end of the fourth quarter was 8.5% versus 8.8% at the end of the third quarter. While earnings have grown year-over-year, the reason for the declining ROE is due to lag associated with the timing of annual filings as we continue to make significant capital investments along with some timing-related O&M spend. Favorable regulatory treatment has allowed us to file annual DCRF and Biennial T [ph] cost annual filings, but the fast growth in rate base and associated property taxes and depreciation has made lag and more significant factor, so we continue to invest heavily down there. AEP Transmission Holdco, the ROE for Transmission at the end of fourth quarter was 10% versus 10.4% in third quarter, and it's primarily lower in the third quarter due to differences between actual taxes and equity balances versus projected taxes and equity balances filed in our former rate revenue applications. This difference will be recognized in our June 2019 formulate rate true-up. So all in all, still within the range we have talked about previously, the 9.5% to 10% we expect to continue in that range, and we also expect continual improvement in the ones that are hanging a little bit lower. So as we move forward into 2019, we intend on building upon a tremendous track record of delivering earnings well within our guidance range, and in fact, in the last 6 years have exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range each and every year. Borrowing the words from another of this year's Rock Hall of Fame inductees, Dep Leopard, from the song Hysteria, our consistency and quality of delivering positive financial and operational results is such a magical hysteria. When you get that feeling, better start believing, but AEP is, in fact, the premium regulated utility. I have two scores to settle real quickly, Nods I hope you're having a great day. And And Scott, I need more cowbell. Brian? Brian Tierney : Thank you, Nick, and good morning, everyone. I'll take us through the fourth quarter and year-to-date financial results, focusing primarily on year-to-date, provide some insight on loading the economy, review our balance sheet, liquidity and pensions and finish with a review of our outlook for 2019. Let's begin on Slide 7, which shows that operating earnings for the fourth quarter were $0.72 per share or $354 million compared to $0.85 per share or $420 million in 2017. Most of this year-over-year borrowings was expected and came from higher O&M as we reduced spending in 2017 in response to that year's unfavorable weather. All the detail by segment is shown in the boxes on the chart, but the change in the regulated businesses was driven by higher O&M and decreased load, more than offsetting a return on incremental investment to serve our customers. The generation of marketing segment produced operating earnings of $0.07 per share, up $0.02 from last year due to higher energy margins and favorable income taxes. Corporate and Other was down $0.10 due to higher O&M interest and income tax expenses. Turning to Slide 8, we will review the year-to-date comparison in more detail. Our annual operating earnings for 2018 was $3.95 per share or $1.9 billion compared to $3.68 per share or $1.8 billion in 2017. This difference can primarily be attributed to favorable weather and recovery of incremental investment, partially offset by higher O&M as we reduced spending in 2017. Our regulated segments experienced growth for the year. And as expected, our competitive generation of marketing business was down due to last year's asset sales. Looking at the earning drivers by segment. Operating earnings for Vertically Integrated Utilities were $2 per share, up $0.36, with the single largest driver being weather, which added $0.33. Looking at total degree days. 2018 was the highest in the last 30 years while 2017 ranked 29th. Successful implementation of rate changes add another $0.26. Other favorable items included higher transmission revenues in AFUDC as well as lower non-service pension costs and income taxes. Offsetting these items were anticipated decreases in wholesale load and lower normalized retail margins as well as increased O&M and depreciation expenses. The transmission and distribution utilities segment from $1.05 per share, up $0.04 from last year. Favorable drivers included higher rate changes, normalized load and weather as well as lower non-service pension costs. These were partially offset by higher depreciation. The AEP Transmission Holdco segment contributed $0.75 per share, up $0.03 over 2017. This growth reflected the return on incremental rate base, which was mostly offset by prior period accounting adjustments and minimal formula rate true-ups this year compared to the larger one in 2017. Net plant grew by $1.4 billion or 21% since December of 2017. The generation of marketing segment produced earnings of $0.29 per share, down $0.01 from last year, due to the sale of assets and mostly offset by favorable income taxes. Finally, Corporate and Other was down $0.15 per share from last year due to the prior year investment gains and higher interest, O&M and income tax expenses. We are pleased with our results for 2018. As Nick said, we landed in the upper end of updated earnings guidance range. Now let's turn to Slide 9 for an update on normalized load growth. Starting in the lower right chart, normalized retail sales decreased by seven-tenths of a percent for the quarter but ended the year up eight-tenths of a percent compared to 2017. Even with the modest load performance over the last half of 2018, normalized load growth for the year was the strongest AEP has experienced since 2011. Every operating company experienced normalized growth in retail sales in 2018 with the exception of Kentucky Power. Moving clockwise, industrial sales increased by three-tenths of a percent for the quarter and ended the year 2% higher than 2017. The growth in industrial sales moderated in the fourth quarter and was driven by increases in the oil and gas sectors. Industrial sales, excluding oil and gas, experienced a slight contraction in the quarter. This was driven by a more restrictive U.S. trade policy, a weaker global economy, a stronger dollar and lower energy prices. In the upper left chart, normalized residential sales increased by two-tenths of a percent for the quarter and ended the year up six-tenths of a percent over 2017. Growth in residential sales was mostly due to customer count growth while normalized usage was down half a percent for the quarter. For the year, residential customer counts increased by six-tenths of a percent, which is twice the growth experienced in 2017. Finally, in the upper right chart, commercial sales decreased by 2.8% in the fourth quarter and ended the year down half a percent from 2017. Commercial sales were down across all our operating companies for the quarter and the year. The estimates for load growth presented on this chart differ slightly from what we showed at the EEI conference in fall due to the fact that we now have actual numbers for the full year of 2018 rather than the estimates we have at that time. Our actual load estimate for 2019 has not changed. Now let's turn to Slide 10 and review the status of our regional economies. As shown in the upper left chart, GDP growth in AEP service territory was 2.8% for the quarter, which is three-tenths of a percent below the U.S. The U.S. economy has eclipsed that of AEP service territory since the tariffs went into effect in the second quarter. As discussed on previous calls, AEP has a higher exposure to tariff given its higher concentration to export manufacturing. In fact, 38% of all U.S. exports originate in the 11 states served by regulated utilities. The upper right chart shows the gap between employment growth is narrowing between AEP service territory and the U.S. The U.S. has experienced stable job growth over the past 2 years, and the job market within AEP's footprint has continued to improve. For the quarter, job growth in AEP's territory was 1.3% with higher growth in the West. The unemployment rate for AEP's territory fell to 4.1% this quarter, which is the lowest level on record. The sectors that added the most job this quarter, the professional and business services, education and health services and leisure and hospitality. Final chart at the bottom shows the income growth within AEP's footprint has not kept pace with the U.S. in recent months. For the quarter, personal income growth for AEP was two-tenths of a percent below the U.S. Income growth is a key driver for residential and commercial sales growth. It is too early to know what the impact of the partial federal government shutdown will have in our economy. Federal government share of unemployment across our territory ranges between seven-tenths of a percent in Arkansas to 7.2% in Texas, with some portion of these numbers being unaffected military employees. The longer the shutdown lasts, the higher impact we would expect to see in residential commercial sales due to lower personal income and spending. Overall, 2018 was a strong year for the economy in AEP service territory. The boost to incomes from a robust job market and tax reform create a momentum earlier in the year that carried us through the headwinds of the tariffs, stronger dollar and higher interest rates. We expect economic growth to continue in 2019. Now let's move to Slide 11 and review the company's capitalization, liquidity and pensions. Our debt to total capital ratio increased slightly during the quarter to [57%]. Our FFO to debt ratio was solidly in the Baa1 range at 17.8% and our net liquidity stood at about $3.1 billion supported by our revolving credit facility. Our qualified pension funding decreased to 99%, and our OPEB funding decreased to 129%. A drop in yields increased the liabilities for both plans while at the same time falling equity prices attractive from asset returns. Our fixed income holdings provided a positive offset to the liability increases in equity losses. Investors have been asking if our pension expense estimates are increasing in 2019 due to market volatility rate in 2018. We are not seeing a meaningful change in our assumed pension expense. This is largely due to having what we believe are appropriately conservative assumptions regarding discount rate for liabilities and the expected rate of return for investments. We are also comfortable with our asset allocation. As we disclose at EEI, our assumed pension discount rate for 2018 was 3.65%, and for 2019, it's 4.3%. Our assumed asset rate of return has increased slightly by 25 basis points to 6.25%. Our target asset allocation is 25% equities, 60% fixed income and 15% alternatives. Our combined pension, OPEB, pretax expense was a credit of [$65] million in 2018, and we expect a credit of $59 million in 2019. Now let's wrap this up on Slide 12 and try to get to your questions. We begin 2019 with a solid track record. Our earnings were strong in 2018 as we continue to invest capital in our businesses. For 8 years now, we have maintained O&M discipline and kept spending net of assets in a tight range of between $2.8 billion and $3.1 billion. In addition, over time, we have grown our dividend with earnings and expect to be able to do so going forward. Last year, AEP's Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend by 8.1% on an annual basis. This increase, along with the midpoint of our 2019 earnings guidance range, brings our payout ratio to the middle of our [60%] to 70% targeted range. Looking ahead to 2019, we are reiterating our operating earnings guidance of $4 to $4.20 per share. We will finalize our pending rate cases and move forward with opportunities in the renewables space. We will continue our disciplined approach to allocating capital and are confident that there is significant runway in our capital programs to reaffirm our 5% to 7% operating earnings growth rate. With that, I will turn the call over to the operator for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Your line is open. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Good morning. Nicholas Akins : How are you doing? Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Good, congratulations. So let me go back to where you started the call a little bit. Certainly, we're impressed by the comment on being disappointed, but not being at the high end of that 5% to 7% range. Can you comment a little bit on what gives you that confidence today just given some of the movie [ph] business at the end of the year? But also, I just wanted to understand what your expectations are for moderating ROE in Ohio. I know we've been talking about it for a little bit. But basically, are you still talking about being at the higher end potentially despite having that moderation? And where the other pluses this year as you think about it? Nicholas Akins : Yes. So yes, we do expect the high end of that moderation. And also, as I look at the year going into it, certainly with the capital plan that we put out there, the consistency associated with that as well, the opportunities that exist in front of us, we continue to look at those opportunities. Certainly, the integrated resource plans are applied with the various states, what we're doing not only from that from a video [ph] and incur perspective. I think we have more tailwinds than headwinds. And when we look at the plan that we put forward, it's a solid plan. And as I've reiterated several times, it doesn't include some real opportunities out there for us to even achieve better results. So - and I don't - and really, I really think of that as sustainable results, not like up 1 year down, another year, that kind of thing. We pride ourselves on that element of consistency. And certainly, the capital plan demonstrates that, but also the opportunities ahead of us, they are more singular opportunities, more singles and doubles because, obviously, if we've gotten something like Wind Catcher, for example, front-end loaded, many of the integrated resource plan activities, but in this case, following these plans and the smaller projects that will come into play, and we'll see the continuing improvement. I think we have a great case for the utility and for - the AEP utilities to own use assets. And depending upon the outcome of that, certainly, I would suspect some positive movement from that perspective. So I feel good about it. I think I fell good about our culture of the organization. Our culture is around innovation, but it's also definitely around bending the O&M curve and addressing the issues in front of us. I mean, you look at the - for example, the weather last year in '17 versus last 2 years ago versus '18, very mild weather in '17. Earnings still came in where we really we're telling the market they would come in at. '18, it was ahead, still came in where we said it would be and, obviously, beat the midpoint. So we had some resiliency that's built in our organization, the culture of the organization that will address to those kinds of results. So I'm optimistic. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent. And you comment or perhaps elaborate rather on some new developments in Oklahoma, you alluded to several potential positives riders and other new mechanisms is I'll leave it abroad in Oklahoma, you helped improve your earned ROEs. What does that mean with respect to another rate case? Or do you think, largely, you can achieve some of these through the current rate case? I know it's still pending, but I just want to understand at least from a - more of a process perspective how you're thinking about it here. Nicholas Akins : Yes. Certainly, I don't want to presuppose the outcome. It'd be great if we got pretty considerable result in this rate case to get us back on an even footing. And certainly, Walmart, I guess, was one of the interveners that had - that's obviously performance-based ratemaking. I don't know about that. But certainly, looking forward, looking test years. So that'd be a great outcome to be able to look at forward-looking test years and as well some of the other - even - I think it was the Attorney General, maybe someone else, but was open to actually putting in an additional generation, additional distribution related rider activity. So - and I still have work to do with the industrials. They were probably the most negative from an intervener perspective. But I really believe when you look at the discussions and what was centered versus the last case and the previous case, there at least now is recognition of the issues that we have and there's no doubt that the issues that we're discussing are well known by the commissioners and certainly the interveners. So I'm hopeful that it can certainly move to a more positive outcome. What we're looking for, obviously, is progress, and we expect progress. And I think there has to be a clear message around that because we've languished since 2013 in Oklahoma, and that just has to change. And as a matter of fact, with the integrated resource plans we have filed in those various states, PSO in Oklahoma, obviously, is one of those, we just need a positive outcome rate case to make additional investments of that kind in the state. And obviously, the timing will work out to where we'll be able to make those kinds of decisions. And then I think it's pretty well known now that also, Oklahoma is like our second corporate headquarters to us. With over 600 people, they are that focus on primarily the Western properties but also some of the Eastern activities as well. Those are not PSO employees. They are AEP employees. So we should put AEP on top a building there so the Oklahoma knows that we do have a significant presence there. And I think that's important, and I think it's important to the livelihoods of the Tulsa area, but also I think it's important for this company to be able to have a central location like that, that we're able to operate out of at. So there's a lot of things in the context of all this that's probably becoming well known, and hopefully, will drive us to a better outcome. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent. Thank you. Best of luck. Nicholas Akins : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Nicholas Akins : Morning, Jonathan. Jonathan Arnold : Hi. Morning. Just to go back to your comments on the upper end of the - upper range of the 5% to 7%. Were those specific to 2019 guidance or they are more statement about your confidence in executing in that range over the 5-year plan? I wasn't quite clear when you set it at the outset. Brian Tierney : Yes. We said 5% to 7% growth rate -- long-term growth rate over the future periods. And obviously, when you're paying renewables, they're not going to be in place until 2022. From a financial standpoint, that's part of it. So it's -- I would say it's geared more toward the long-term, but the trajectory should hold true. And there'll be things that come in during '19. There'd be things that come in during '20 and '21 and in the future years. So I think we have real opportunities in each and every year. But obviously, we're positioning this as part of our 5% to 7% growth rate. Jonathan Arnold : Okay. So that upper range was going to be over the plan effectively? Brian Tierney : Yes, that's right. Jonathan Arnold : Yes. Great. And just the slowdown you saw in sales in the fourth quarter, can you give us a little more of a sense of why you remain confident keeping the 2019 sales estimate unchanged from EEI and maybe some color on what you're seeing early this year and what you're hearing from your customers? Nicholas Akins : Yes. Certainly, Brian can cover this in more detail, but the way I'll see it is we're seeing somewhat of a tempered economy because of the trade issues. And as Brian mentioned, we have a lot of companies in our territory that are -- and certainly trade has an impact. And once those shackles come off, we believe the economy will continue on its previous trajectory. And so it's certainly difficult. The tailwind, that's going to happen. But I think you're hearing some more promising dialogue from our national leaders. Let's hope that continues to be the case. But even then, I guess, probably, we look at customer counts. Customer counts is up considerably, so we're very happy with that. And the fundamentals, seeing this still being in place for the economy continued to roll along. From the world economy perspective, obviously, that would have an impact, but I think that's probably, again, tariff driven for many respects. Brian Tierney : Jon, a lot of the growth that we anticipate in 2019 is going to be driven by the industrial space, and particularly industrial space in the oil and gas sector. We see a lot of company proposed and company invested -- customer invested in expansions in that area, and they are close at hand. We expect a lot of those to come on in 2019. In the fourth quarter, oil and gas was up 5.6%. In the third quarter, it was up 7.7%, and we expect that expansion to continue in 2019. Jonathan Arnold : Brian, can you do the math for us, though? How much that wasn't oil and gas was down in 4Q? Brian Tierney : Yes. In fourth quarter, it was down six-tenths of a percent non-oil and gas industrial. And in the third quarter, non-oil and gas industrial was up six-tenths of a percent. Jonathan Arnold : Okay. And -- so obviously, your outlook is premised on an assumption with growth continues, you're talking about the plan, having building resilience in the company, talk to me a little bit about how resilient you think your plan is maybe if that view doesn't pan out. Brian Tierney : Yes. I think if you look at -- and Nick talked about it, the change that we had year-on-year, '17 to '18, in terms of weather and how we were able to adjust O&M in both years to be able to hit our numbers, I think that demonstrates that resilience. So whether it's weather, whether it's loan growth, whether it's tariff impact or whatever, we actively manage our rate throughout the year, putting the brakes on, or the accelerator on as the case may be to get work done, what we need to get done. So I think just the weather year-on-year demonstrates that resiliency. Nicholas Akins : And I think we're seeing sort of a -- if you put a microscope to it with the industrials impacted by the tariffs in particular, the commercials, particularly the supply to the major industrials and those kinds of establishments will have an impact. And I think we're probably seeing somewhat of an immediate impact there. And again, I think as the industrials start to pick back up, the commercials should start to come back as well. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Ali Agha of SunTrust. Your line is open. Ali Agha : First question, Nick or Brian, just reconfirming, when you talk about the 5% to 7% growth rate, what's the base of the change? Have you roll it forward? Or can you just remind us the base year for that? Brian Tierney : It's midpoint of 2018 guidance, so it's off 3 85. Ali Agha : Off 3 85, I got to you. Brian Tierney : Yes, yes\u2026 Ali Agha : Okay. And then the renewables that you talked about in Ohio and in other places, the potential, if you do get approvals for those, can you just remind us in aggregate what kind of incremental CapEx we'd be talking about [indiscernible]? Brian Tierney : Yes. So as for the renewables in Ohio that we've been talking about, it's not incremental CapEx, right? So the solar that we're talking about are PPAs, so that's not CapEx. For the competitive renewables, okay, so I'm not talking about Ohio, but I'm talking about Chuck's [ph] business, for the 5-year period, '19 forward, we anticipate spending about $2.2 billion over that 5-year period. Nicholas Akins : But the renewables associated with the regulated side of the integrated resource plans of PSO and SWEPCO, that would be additional capital requirements based upon really what the ownership percentage winds up being. Brian Tierney : And important to say, Nick, because we get these questions, the earnings associated with that are not reflected in our numbers today. Nicholas Akins : That's right. That's right. And as far as Ohio is concerned, we elected not to participate in the construction of the project. But at the end of the day, when we get approval, there is an added component to the plan going forward that really reinforces our cap structure at AEP Ohio and evaluates the risk associated with the long-term PPA of that sort into construction. So you'll still seeing the earnings impact of the Ohio solar as well. Ali Agh : I see. But just to be clear, the -- from a regulated rate base perspective, there's no incremental CapEx associated with the Ohio renewables? Did I\u2026 Nicholas Akins : No. And actually, when the bids come in in March, we'll have a better understanding of what the CapEx looks like. Brian Tierney : That's for the consumer protection plan. Nicholas Akins : Yes. Ali Agh : Okay. And the CapEx numbers that you have in the slide, no changes there since EEI. Is that correct? Brian Tierney : That's correct. Ali Agh : And my last question on Oklahoma, Nick, I mean, again, assuming that the outcome is suboptimal or not as good as you would like it to be, what's your latest thinking there? Does that still give you hope that you can keep pushing and then maybe get to that end result? Or how are you thinking about Oklahoma post this current rate case? Nicholas Akins : I think some of the positions taken by it in the interveners and others, there is some cause for hope that research recognition of the issues, but I'm not going to presuppose the outcome because I did that 2x before, and who knows what the outcome will be. Certainly, the issue should be very well known. I would say that just based on the response of the interveners, it's marginally better than what -- how they responded earlier. So I guess you can look at that as some positive, but we won't know until we get into the discussions with them or -- and go through this process. And really what matters is what in the Oklahoma commission comes up with in terms of running order, and they recognize the value that PSO provides to the state. And so that's what we're looking for. And if -- as I've said earlier, we will wait for those results and then we'll make determinations of what the next steps are. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon of KeyBanc. Paul Ridzon : Can you just clarify, when you say bend the O&M curve, is not decelerating O&M growth? Is that fattening or is it negative growth? Brian Tierney : Negative. Nicholas Akins : Yes, negative. We really -- by bending, we mean negative it. Paul Ridzon : Can you kind of give a percentage kind of to think about [over] the next few years? Brian Tierney : Yes. So we haven't said what that would be, Paul. If you look at our 2.8 to 3.1 that we've been in for about the last 8 years, we're looking to break through that and turn that negative, and we have plans to do that. It includes what we've done on lean activities, what we've done in process improvement. It includes automation, box. It includes partnering with third-party suppliers, like what we've done with an accounting and tax initiative with Accenture. And it's bringing all those things to build across the company that we're going to try and break through that $2.8 billion of non-spending that's not altered in past years. Paul Ridzon : And then just to clarify, the 5% to 7% does not include renewables at PSO or SWEPCO or Chuck's business, is that correct? Nicholas Akins : It includes the capital in Chuck's business, the $2.2 billion over the plan. It does not include the regulated renewables. It does not include Ohio. Paul Ridzon : And then any projects that could be impacted by the situation in FERC? Nicholas Akins : No, no. We don't see any projects impacted from that perspective because FERC obviously continues to advance transmission spending. And actually, the resource projects themselves, yes, we've moved to West transmission off of those. So I'm assuming it's on the transmission. Paul Ridzon : Yes. Nicholas Akins : We don't see any impacts there. Paul Ridzon : And finally, with the 2.8% reduction in commercial sales, is that just [clearly] volatility? Or is there something along the line there? Brian Tierney : We think it's clearly volatility. We don't see that continuing as a trend into 2019. Could have been associated with higher consumer interest costs in some demand side management that we across our system, but we don't see that as continuing into the new year. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Praful Mehta with Citigroup. Praful Mehta : So I just wanted to understand in Chuck's business, any exposure to PG&E or California Utilities that we should be aware or thinking about? Nicholas Akins : No. That is the right answer. Very fortunate in that regard. A lot of our optics are with our municipal co-ops and used customers. Praful Mehta : Okay, great. Dodged a bullet which is great. I guess just touching on the review, like strategic review that you've talked about in the past, and obviously, you've touched on Oklahoma already. But just on a strategic perspective, is there any view that we should be thinking about around any of the utilities? If they don't -- if you don't get the outcomes you're looking for, is that still on the table right now? Or is that too far out at least not a 2019 event? Nicholas Akins : I think -- and the way we look at it is every utility that we have, we wanted to grow and prosper. And to the extent that they can grow and prosper and have a proper regulatory treatment, it's a great outcome. I think a couple 3 years ago, I guess, 3 years, we're talking about Kentucky and Kentucky's turned around. We focused on 2 things, the regulatory relationship and the compact that we have there, but also our emphasis placed upon economic development in the state of Kentucky. And that picture has turned around markedly. For PSO, PSO is now in the radar screen and probably in the middle of the radar screen because we definitely want to be a part of the economic development picture of Oklahoma, and we definitely want to be able to move forward in a very positive way on investments that benefit the customer experience in that state. So the way you look at it is we have a set of assets. And if they perform well, fine. If they're electronically underperforming, then we have to take steps in some fashion to alleviate that situation for our shareholders. And really, the focus because many times, when you have an underachiever, a lot of effort goes into trying to reconcile the situation. And there are some that say that PSO doesn't have a revenue problem. It has a spending problem. And that is just so far from the truth. It's just incredible because we run 7 utilities, and we run those utilities in much the same fashion. And we know what it takes to provide the customer services required, and PSO has been at the top of the list in terms of its performance. And I really believe that if you're a residential customer, if you're an industrial customer, you should you really take a hard look at what's happening there in Oklahoma, and it could very well have an impact on not only the presence in the future, but also the customer experience itself, and we don't want that to happen. So as we get these assets, obviously, we'll continue to make steps to further optimize our portfolio based upon what we see. Praful Mehta : Okay. That's super helpful. And then -- and finally, you guys have been able to manage through different [indiscernible] years. It sounds like if you do have the shackles that are continuing to stay, let's say, from [Dallas] and other constraints from a macro perspective, and it doesn't work in your favor, is there any time that we should be worried about the '19 profile? Or do you think you have enough tools in the toolkit to manage to run those potentially macro challenges around the earnings for '19? Nicholas Akins : Yes, I think we're fine. We've had -- and if you look at [over] the last 2 years, 3 years, maybe even longer than that we've had perturbations of customer class going up and down and actually residential going down has more of an impact than commercial or industrial. And so the mix obviously has an impact because the margins are different based upon each customer class. But our service territory is very diverse, very -- certainly, every part of the economy is represented. And our customer mix is really pretty resilient in and of itself. So there's a lot of internal levers that continue to adjust for one another from that perspective. But at the same time, we will adjust when the economy is -- if the economy were to chronically be suffering, and we saw that on a continual success of a quarterly trend, then we would certainly make adjustments that were necessary to ensure that we remain financially healthy, and we intend on doing that. But I really believe we're in good shape in that respect. And we'll watch this next quarter and the quarter after, and hopefully, we'll see some progress in the federal government side. I think certainly immigration needs to get solved and the 2 parties need to get talking to one another again, and maybe that will warm them up and then they'll move to greater and better better things for the economy, but they've got to get going. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with ISI. Greg Gordon : So just two quick questions. One, just to be clear, you said the anchor for the 5% to 7% is 3 85 in '18? Brian Tierney : Yes. Nicholas Akins : Yes. Greg Gordon : Okay. So I mean, I guess this is just logically correct, but the high end of the guidance range for '19, which put -- would put you above 7%. You're not -- this is more a long-term target than an annual we're going to be tight inside the stance type of guidance? [indiscernible] Nicholas Akins : That's right. ROE is in the midpoint of the 5% to 7%. And then you look at the opportunities available to us in that 5% to 7% bandwidth, it's -- like I said, it's more tailwinds than headwinds. Greg Gordon : And then just one final question because there's just -- there's been some conversation about this. You continue to give us a financial forecast that even though the absolute level of leverage has come up since 2013, the FFO to that metric continues to be really resilient just around 18%. And you're still confident that through this forecast period, you can maintain -- there'll probably be no deterioration in your FFO to that metrics. Nicholas Akins : We haven't said that. We do anticipate that it will [decrease] over the time period, and we expect it to approach [to] 15% level during the term of the forecast. Greg Gordon : Okay, okay. Well, that's a higher number than other people have prognosticated anyway. So just wanted to make sure we understood what you thought the trend was. Nicholas Akins : We're very interested in the FFO to that percentage, and we intend to maintain our credit rating. Greg Gordon : Okay. So you think 15% is sort of regular trend down to over this forecast period? Brian Tierney : In that area, yes. A - Nicholas Akins Thanks, Greg. Bette Jo Rozsa : Operator, we have time for one more question. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Angieszka Storozynski of Macquarie. Angieszka Storozynski : I have a bigger picture question. So we are hearing about this precipitous drop in prices for solar power and that more and more senior customers are signing contract with PPA simply because they see it as a way to hedge against fatality in falling natural gas prices that also seem to be at places that are not below favorable solar power curves. So 2 questions. Do you see it as a risk to your vertically integrated utilities given that you do have conventional generation assets? And number two, is there a way to tap into this growth beyond that $2.2 billion that you're planning to spend on renewables on the commercial side? Nicholas Akins : I would say, first of all, we don't see a risk if we're doing it, and we are doing it. And I think we are in discussions with many customers about what their specific resource needs are. We're also looking at various technologies that enable that to happen in some of these large customers. So we really have an opportunity to engage in that discussion. But the other part of it, too, is you see solar, you see energy storage. Those types of applications continue to advance, and that -- and certainly on the transportation sector, you're making up whatever you're going to lose. You're going to make it up with channel growth -- sales channel growth, particularly associated with the advent of electric transportation. So there's real opportunities for us to engage in that, and I think AEP is in a very favorable situation of being able to focus on those types of issues as opposed to something that some calamity that's occurred and real intent of making sure we maintain our operational excellence so that we can focus on those particular types of activities. And certainly, that's happening not only on the regulated side. and obviously, we're having to work with the regulators to broaden the perspective there. For example, continuity of service is not just a distribution line going in the home. It's a distribution with energy storage throughout [indiscernible] outages and really drive toward continuity of service as opposed to just basic service. Certainly, what we're doing with smart cities, what we're doing with other applications and engaging customers in a very substantial sense, those are things that we see as the future, and we are not going to get left behind from that perspective. As a matter of fact, from a technology standpoint, we're at the forefront of these technologies across the gamut. So we have pilots running in every one of our operating companies on various aspects of these technologies, and we intend on that channel growth to occur.

The company is off to an excellent start for 2019. We are pleased to report solid earnings of $1.16 per share on a GAAP basis and $1.19 per share operating, which compares to $0.92 a share GAAP and $0.96 per share operating for the first quarter of 2018. The positive drivers were fully realized outcomes from a multitude of rate cases from 2017 to 2019, increased transmission margins from invested capital, and lower O&M, mostly timing in this case. The company continues to excel and our employees continue to deliver on the execution of our strategy of being the premium regulated utility. Overall, this was a great quarter for the company. There are a few topics we\u2019d like to cover before moving on to coverage of our financial performance. First regarding the Oklahoma rate case outcome, this was an important case. While we didn\u2019t get everything we hoped to achieve, we were successful in gaining our most important objectives : an improved ROE opportunity, riders for transmission and some distribution investments, and most of all, a much improved regulatory environment. The outcome of the case bodes well for our continued focus on renewables and hopefully natural gas at some point in the state. I will discuss the regulated wind RFP initiative later. We certain appreciate the constructive focus of the Oklahoma Corporation Commission, the staff and parties on this case. Our acquisition of the Sempra renewables portfolio is now finalized and we are moving forward with our renewables build-out according to plan. We have extended employment offers which have been accepted by many of the members of the previous Sempra team and we welcome them to the AEP family. We are excited about the acquisition of the existing operational projects, the additional developmental projects, and the Safe Harbor equipment that can provide additional value.  In addition to that effort, we have significant opportunities for renewables in our regulated businesses. PSO and Swepco issued an RFP for up to 2,200 megawatts of wind generation. We have completed the bid process and received many quality responses. We are in the process of negotiating terms with the preferred bidders and plan to file with the state commissions in July requesting approvals to proceed. This should allow time for approvals in 2020 and for commercial operations of the projects by the end of 2021. As a reminder, these projects are consistent with our integrated resource plans and they are currently not included in our capital and funding plans. Now to the Ohio Clear Air Fund legislation, the company is supportive to the Ohio House leadership\u2019s focus and efforts on addressing key energy policy issues that have plagued the state for years. In order for the legislation to benefit all Ohio customers, there are certain issues that must be addressed. First, an elimination of the renewable portfolio standard should be replaced with the opportunity for utilities to voluntarily develop economic renewable resources in the state. In addition, contracts entered into under the existing renewable portfolio standard must be grandfathered so as to not punish utilities who are compliant with Ohio law. Second in regard to energy efficiency, AEP is concerned about a rapid elimination of EE programs that have benefited our customers for many years. In lieu of immediate elimination of EE programs, previously approved plans should be phased out over the next several years. We look forward to working with lawmakers during the process to achieve a balanced energy bill that provides benefits to all Ohio customers. Turning to the equalizer chart on Slide 5, AEP\u2019s overall regulated operations ROE is currently 10.1% versus 9.7% last quarter, placing us at the upper end of our targeted range. The improvement in the first quarter of 2019 versus the fourth quarter of 2018 is due to rate case outcomes in several of our jurisdictions as well as timing effects of lower O&M and taxes.  Now let\u2019s take a look at the individual companies. The seat-adjusted ROE for AEP Ohio at the end of the first quarter was 13.2% versus 13.1% in the fourth quarter of 2018. This year, we will only be showing the seat-adjusted ROE since the legacy items are rolling off throughout the year. We expect to end 2019 in the 13% range. Appalachian Power\u2019s ROE at the end of the first quarter was 9.5%, comparable to last quarter. APCo received an order from West Virginia at the end of February approving their settlement, which includes a $44 million rate base increase with a 9.75% ROE, effective March 6 of this year.  The ROE for Kentucky Power at the end of the first quarter was 8.6% compared to 9% at the end of 2018. The slight decline was primarily due to lower sales and usage driven by weather and an unfavorable tax adjustment.  I&M\u2019s performance remains strong at 12.8% versus 11.4% at the end of 2018. I&M\u2019s positive performance is driven by the favorable rate reviews that occurred mid-2018 as well as continued discipline managing O&M expenses. The ROE for PSO improved to 8% versus 6.9% at the end of 2018. This primarily reflects the implementation of the 2017 base rate case, better weather, and the absence of Wind Catcher expenses. PSO received an order on its base case settlement in March 2019 approving a $46 million increase and a 9.4% ROE. Rates went into effect in April of this year. Importantly, the order contained a provision for full transmission tracker and a partial distribution tracker. PSO is expected to approach its authorized ROE by the end of this year. The ROE for Swepco stands at 7.2% versus 6.5% at the end of 2018. This improvement is due to incremental rate relief and lower O&M expenses, also reflecting the absence of Wind Catcher expenses. We filed an Arkansas base rate case in February seeking a $46 million rate increase based on a requested 10.5% ROE. Swepco\u2019s ROE continues to be affected by the Arkansas share of the Turk plant that is not in rates. This impacts ROE by 135 basis points.  The ROE for AEP Texas at the end of the first quarter was 7.6% versus 8.5% at the end of 2018. The expected decline in ROE is due to lag associated with the timing of annul filings and our base rate review that we plan to file with the PUCT on May 1 of this year. Continued high level of investments and timing of our planned comprehensive rate review will continue to impact the ROE in this year. The ROE for AEP transmission holdco at the end of the first quarter was 9.9%, comparable to last quarter. The under-recovery of expenses that occurred in 2018 will be trued up this June. AEP transmission holdco is projected to achieve an ROE of approximately 10% by year end. We are off to a great start in 2019, so let\u2019s go through the financial results for the quarter, provide some insight on load and the economy, and finish with a review of our balance sheet and liquidity. Looking at Slide 6, which shows that operating earnings for the first quarter were $1.19 per share or $585 million, compared to $0.96 per share or $473 million in 2018. Looking at the earnings drivers by segment, operating earnings for vertically integrated utilities were $0.63 per share, up $0.16. Favorable drivers included higher rate changes due to recovery of incremental investment, AFUDC and transmission revenue, as well as lower O&M. Income taxes were also a driver for the quarter but will not be for the year due to timing. Partially offsetting these favorable items were lower normalized load, unfavorable weather compared to last year, and increased depreciation expense.  The transmission and distribution utilities segment earned $0.32 per share, up $0.07 from last year primarily driven by the reversal of the regulatory provision in Ohio. Other favorable drivers included higher transmission revenue and rate changes. Partially offsetting these favorable items were higher depreciation, O&M, and unfavorable weather. The AEP transmission holdco segment continued to grow, contributing $0.25 per share, an improvement of $0.04 over last year. This growth reflected the return on incremental rate base. Net plant increased by $1.4 billion or 19% since March of last year.  Generation and marketing produced earnings of $0.09 per share, up a penny from last year. Increases in retail and wholesale margins were offset by lower generation sales due to plant retirements and outages.  Finally, corporate and other was down $0.05 per share from last year primarily driven by unfavorable income tax adjustments and other consolidating tax items that will reverse by year end, other variance related to higher interest expense and lower O&M. Overall, we experienced a solid quarter and are confident in reaffirming our annual operating earnings guidance.  Now let\u2019s turn to Slide 7. Before we dig into the detail for the quarter, let me highlight some minor changes to the slide. You may have noticed that our growth estimates for the 2019 forecast of commercial and industrial sales have changed from what we presented in the last earnings release, while total and residential sales remain unchanged. This is due to a reclassification between the commercial and industrial classes. There were no customer, tariff or revenue impacts, just geography and presentations between the two classes. For ease of use, we have adjusted the prior quarters to reflect the new classifications. Now let\u2019s look at the quarterly detail. Starting in the lower right chart, normalized retail sales decreased by three-tenths of a percent for the quarter compared to 2018. It is worth mentioning that retail sales were down at all of the vertically integrated utilities while each of the T&D utilities experienced modest growth in the quarter. Moving clockwise, industrial sales decreased by four-tenths of a percent for the quarter. Sales in the industrial class have been slowing in recent quarters as the impact of a strong dollar and a more restrictive trade policy have challenged export manufacturers within AEP\u2019s footprint.  During last year\u2019s first quarter earnings call, we reported widespread growth across all operating companies in every one of the top 10 industrial sectors. Now a year later, industrial sales grew only in our western operating companies and Ohio, and in only six of the top 10 industrial sectors. The majority of this came from the oil and gas sectors. I\u2019ll provide more color on our industrial sales on the next slide. In the upper left chart, normalized residential sales increased by nine-tenths of a percent compared with the first quarter of 2018. The growth in residential sales was partially due to customer count growth which increased by half a percent, while the rest came from growth in normalized usage. Incomes grew faster than inflation for the quarter, which provided our customers with more disposable income. I\u2019ll provide more detail on the economy later in the presentation. Finally in the upper right chart, commercial sales decreased by 1.7%. Commercial sales were down across all operating companies. The tightening labor market and rising interest rates have limited this sector\u2019s growth in recent quarter.  Turning to Slide 8, I want to provide a little more color with respect to our industrial sales. The chart shows the disparity in sales between the oil and gas sectors and all other industrial sectors. The oil and gas sector load, shown in blue, mirrors the pattern in oil prices over time as expected. For the quarter, industrial sales in the oil and gas sectors increased by 5.1% while the rest of our industrial sales, shown in red, declined by 2.2%. We expect the growth in oil and gas to continue through 2019 as prices recover. In addition, our economic development team has identified a number of new oil and gas projects that are expected to come online throughout the year. Now focusing on the red bars, you see the non-oil and gas industrials experienced robust growth in 2018 until the trade policy changes were announced at the end of the first quarter. Since then, a noticeable deceleration has occurred. Most of this slowdown can be traced back to export industries such as chemical manufacturing, which is down 9% for the quarter. As discussed on previous calls, AEP has a higher exposure to trade policy given the higher concentration of export manufacturers located within the service territory. Now let\u2019s turn to Slide 9 and review the status of our regional economies. As shown in the upper left chart, GDP growth in AEP\u2019s service territory was 2.9% for the quarter, which is a tenth of a percent above the U.S. Outside of Kentucky, GDP growth for every operating company was within two-tenths of a percent of the U.S. for the quarter.  The upper right chart shows that the gap in employment growth between AEP service territory in the U.S. did not change in the first quarter. Job growth in AEP\u2019s territory was still 1.3% with higher growth coming from the west, where most of the oil and gas activity is located. In fact, job growth in the natural resources and mining sector posted the strongest growth in the quarter at 4.3%. Other sectors that experienced robust job growth for the quarter include construction, professional and business services, education and health services, and leisure and hospitality. The final chart at the bottom shows that income growth within AEP\u2019s footprint improved in the first quarter while U.S. income growth moderated. For the quarter, personal incomes within AEP\u2019s service territory increased by 3.7%, which was half a percent below the U.S. As described earlier, income growth is a key driver for residential and commercial sales.  Now let\u2019s move on to Slide 10 and review the company\u2019s capitalization and liquidity. Our debt to total capital ratio increased eight-tenths of a percent during the quarter to 57.8%. Our FFO to debt ratio finished the quarter at 18.1%. We expect this ratio to decline over the year as we flow back ADIT to customers, but expect the number to remain in the Baa1 range. Our net liquidity stood at about $3.1 billion, supported by our revolving credit facility. Our qualified pension funding decreased to 98% and our OPEB funding moderately increased to 131%. A drop in yields increased the liabilities for both plans but strong equity returns helped to offset the liability increases. In March, AEP issued $805 million of mandatory convertible equity units. This issuance combines a three-year junior subordinated debt instrument with a three-year forward purchase contract for equity. This issuance de-risks our financing plan by providing required capital now and equity later when needed, and not sooner. It delays equity needs above our DRIP program until 2022. The issuance maintains our balance sheet strength, enhances our credit metrics, and allows us to invest growth capital for the benefit of our customers and for the recently closed renewables transaction. Let\u2019s try and wrap this up on Slide 11 so we can get to your questions. We will move forward with opportunities in the renewable space and continue to optimize our O&M spend. Our performance in the first quarter and the stability of our regulated business model gives us the confidence to re-affirm our operating earnings guidance range of $4 to $4.20 per share.  With that, I will turn the call over to the operator for your questions. Operator : [Operator instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Praful Mehta with Citigroup. Please go ahead. Praful Mehta : Thanks so much, hi guys. Brian Tierney : Good morning, Praful. Praful Mehta : Morning. Maybe just the details on the mandatory convert in \u201922, what are the terms in terms of what price at which you expect the forward to convert into equity? Brian Tierney : It was priced at $82.98, and the company gets the benefit of the first 20% of upside, so to almost $100 per share, and we\u2019re locked in on the downside from that price. Praful Mehta : Got you, thank you. Then on the renewables side, wanted to understand a couple of things. Is there any exposure that the current renewable business has to California in terms of PG&E or Edison in terms of any PP exposure as counterparties, and also want to understand when you say move forward with renewable opportunities in the future, are you looking at incremental investments even in 2019 beyond the Sempra acquisition? Brian Tierney : A couple things there, Praful. We don\u2019t have any direct credit exposure to the California utilities on those. Most of those are direct third party consumers of that electricity, so we don\u2019t have that exposure that others do. In regards to the investment in the renewables portfolio, we had talked about a five-year spend of about $2.2 billion with certain projects, including the renewables portfolio from Sempra. We\u2019ve spent about $1.5 billion of that commitment, so we have roughly $700 million left, and we\u2019re looking at opportunities as they become available. We feel the Sempra transaction was at a very good value to the company considering both the existing projects and the developmental projects, and we were able--by making that acquisition early in the five-year period, we were able to solidify and de-risk that $2.2 billion forecast of spend. We\u2019re on our way to meeting the $2.2 billion commitment, and we\u2019re evaluating development projects with the portfolio and looking at other opportunities as well. Praful Mehta : Got you, but you don\u2019t expect to go above the 2.2, it will stay within that budget? Brian Tierney : That\u2019s our anticipation at this point, yes. Praful Mehta : Got you. Very helpful, thank you guys. Brian Tierney : Thanks Praful. Operator : The next question comes from Julien Dumoulin with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Julien Dumoulin : Hey, good morning everyone. Brian Tierney : Good morning Julien. Julien Dumoulin : Perhaps just to pick up where Praful left off, in terms of the incremental and the 2.2 versus the 1.5 commitment already, I understand that you have some inventory to assets that you acquired as part of that Sempra transaction. I\u2019d be curious, how do you think about leveraging that for further investments on the repowering side? When would you need to provide some updates, obviously just given the limited window remaining here from a Safe Harbor perspective, and then separately if you can clarify - obviously the 2.2 is over a five-year period. It would appear that at least from a timing perspective, you\u2019re ahead of what you\u2019d introduced from a ratable improvement in the EEI side last November, I would think. Brian Tierney : Yes, so Julien, I\u2019m going to ask Chuck Zebula, who runs that business and who you know, to address those questions. Chuck Zebula : Yes, good morning, Julien. There are opportunities that we\u2019re pursuing. As you know, we just closed on the transaction on Monday. We\u2019re actively working with our new team members. The status of the development projects, even as we have taken over this week, there is some positive news coming out of a township vote in Michigan on one of our projects. There\u2019s still additional due diligence. We realize that the time is ticking to reach 2020. We may reach the light of day on one or two of these by 2020, but I can\u2019t commit to that at this point in time. They can turn into \u201921 projects with some structuring and items we would need to do with other parties, but nonetheless there are opportunities here and they're relatively small bites as opposed to significant large projects, and that\u2019s why we think a lot of these could get done within the $700 million that Brian had talked about. Julien Dumoulin : Got it. Then in terms of timing for earnings? Chuck Zebula : Well in terms of timing, I think absolutely we\u2019ll be updating quarterly where we are in some of this stuff. It\u2019s a full push forward, so--but yes, as we pulled the transaction and the spend earlier, you\u2019ll see the earnings from those contributions here in \u201919 and beyond. Julien Dumoulin : Got it. Just to clarify this point, obviously you have a number of other RFPs out there on the Wind Catcher 2.0 structure. That\u2019s separate and distinct from any inventory to assets that you might have for repowering assets to meet the $2.2 billion bucket, right? Brian Tierney : That\u2019s correct, Julien, completely different efforts. Julien Dumoulin : Excellent. All right, I\u2019ll leave it there. Thank you. Brian Tierney : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ali Agha with SunTrust. Please go ahead. Ali Agha : Thank you, good morning. Brian Tierney : Good morning, Ali. Ali Agha : Brian, in the past you folks have talked about confidence level trending to the higher end or the upper half of the 5 to 7% range of earnings and growth that you\u2019ve targeted. Are we still looking at it from that perspective, and also to clarify, that was based on the existing budget? That was not assuming new incremental capex, the existing budget could trend you in the upper half of 5 to 7? Is that correct? Brian Tierney : That\u2019s right, Ali. I think the way Nick has phrased it before is this management team will be very disappointed if we\u2019re not in the upper end of that range. Ali Agha : Upper end of the range - got you. Okay. Then separately, these RFPs and other opportunities, primarily I guess in renewables, that you are working on, can you give us some sense of size? I mean, if these do come through and you\u2019ve pointed out these would be incremental to the base plan, but what kind of cumulative size are we looking at in terms of that opportunity? Brian Tierney : The regulated RFPs that we\u2019ve issued in the market are for up to 2,200 megawatts, and the reason that that\u2019s the number is that\u2019s consistent with what our IRPs in those jurisdictions would call for, for renewables, so a significant amount not dissimilar to what we were talking about in terms of generation with Wind Catcher. Ali Agha : And that would be owned by AEP [indiscernible] if that comes through? Brian Tierney : Yes. Ali Agha : Okay, and the timing around that again? Brian Tierney : We\u2019re shooting for the end of 2021. Ali Agha : Got you. Brian Tierney : Ali, to your point, that is--those plans are not in our capital and funding plans today, but we\u2019ll adjust those plans as we go forward and we firm up how much it is we\u2019re talking about and confirm that the timing is at the end of 2021. Ali Agha : I got you. Final question, Brian, on the transmission front, you put out a very strong growth outlook to 2021 very specifically. As you look out beyond that, at least through \u201923 since your capex budget goes out that many years, are you looking at a similar kind of growth over the \u201922, \u201923 period, or does it taper off? How are you looking at that transmission growth? Brian Tierney : No, we see our ability to continue to grow investment in that space for the foreseeable future. One of the things when you have the largest transmission system in the country, you have the largest aging transmission system in the country, so there\u2019s significant opportunity for us to continue to invest in our own assets, and then there\u2019s also significant developments that we need to do on cyber and security and other efforts, where we\u2019re just beginning to see the front end of that significant increase in spend. Ali Agha : Thank you. Brian Tierney : Thanks Ali. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Turner with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Christopher Turner : Good morning, Brian. I have another question on renewables here, just broadly speaking. I think you talked about the value of the development portfolio within the Sempra purchase, but if you step back and think about the decision to buy that versus build it and the decision to kind of go in more of a wind versus a solar direction here, what informed those decisions and how do you think about your strategic edge in owning these assets versus others? Brian Tierney : Christopher, Chuck and his team have been very selective in the assets that they\u2019ve looked at, looking for high quality contracted assets with credit-worthy counterparties, so they\u2019d been looking at that really on a project by project basis until this opportunity came along. What this opportunity brought with it was a lot of wind, some battery, contracted with high quality counterparties, but it also brought a team with it, and that team is something that we didn\u2019t organically have from a development standpoint. So we got not just a team, but also development projects in the pipeline that we wouldn\u2019t have had otherwise, so whether they\u2019re repowering or the new project that Chuck talked about with the municipal, it takes our business really to the next level. Not to say we\u2019re going to be the next NextEra, because I don\u2019t think that\u2019s our aspiration, but it firms up and de-risks our ability to put that $2.2 billion to work, like we talked about.  I think with Chuck\u2019s existing commercial team, their conservative approach to making sure that we get high quality assets combined with the new development team that we get from Sempra, I think we have a pretty strong organization to go forward and execute against the strategic plans that we\u2019ve laid out. Christopher Turner : Is it fair to think about the returns that you\u2019re going to get there long term as being pretty competitive with what you\u2019re earning at the T&D businesses and the generation businesses today on the utility side? Brian Tierney : Very much so. Christopher Turner : Okay. My second question is a follow-up to an earlier one on the long term EPS guidance. I wanted to make sure I was properly understanding here. You have a situation where you\u2019d be disappointed if you weren\u2019t at the high end of the 5 to 7% range, and just year-to-date you\u2019ve pulled forward that capex with the Sempra deal, you\u2019ve had a constructive settlement in Oklahoma that\u2019s going to allow you to earn a more fair return there, and you still have the potential for the RFP on the utility side with the renewables. Is there any timing shift within that 5 to 7% range that\u2019s occurred here, or is still back end weighted for the high end of that range? Brian Tierney : As we talk about this year, we believe we\u2019re on track to be inside that $4 to $4.20 range, which puts us in the mid-part of that range I think as we execute against some of these things, it\u2019s going to take time for them to cumulatively push us to the higher end of that range, so I\u2019d say no change on this year, and as we look forward to future years as we execute both regulated and some of these competitive opportunities, I think that\u2019s when we\u2019ll be expecting to be in the upper end of that range. Christopher Turner : Okay, that\u2019s fair. Thanks Brian. Brian Tierney : Thanks Christopher. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock. Please go ahead. Paul Patterson : Good morning. Brian Tierney : Good morning, Paul. Paul Patterson : On the significant excess, the seat reversal, can you tell us--I apologize, what triggered that, because it looks like it was a 2016 item that reversed. Could you--? Brian Tierney : Paul, it was a number of things. It was--2016 was the year that we had the global settlement in Ohio and there was some risk as to whether or not issues that were included in the global settlement would be included in the calculation of seat for that year. We believed they should have been excluded and that\u2019s the basis on which we filed our 2016 seat. We had a unanimous settlement saying that there was no significantly excess earnings in 2016 and did not get an order on that until this year. When we looked at that, we had significant risk around that, were uncomfortable at that point given the risks that existed in taking that to income, made the reserve at the time, and now with the positive order on the settlement are able to reverse that. Paul Patterson : Wow, they took that long for a settlement--for an order, excuse me. That\u2019s non-recurring, right? Brian Tierney : I want to be clear about that. It\u2019s included in GAAP earnings and we\u2019ve included it in ongoing earnings, but it\u2019s an item that will not repeat next year. Paul Patterson : Okay. Then with respect to the Ohio legislation, previously you guys, I think had concerns about AEP utility ratepayers paying for other companies\u2019 nuclear plants. How do you guys feel about HP6 as it currently stands? I mean, I know you raised a couple of the issues in your prepared remarks. I was just wondering if you could give a little more color on that. Brian Tierney : Yes, so we think if there\u2019s a full package where all of Ohio customers can benefit, then it\u2019s a worthy effort. If it\u2019s just a bailout for one company or another, it\u2019s not as beneficial to all Ohio customers, so there needs to be a full package of things that get addressed, and energy efficiency, the renewable portfolio standard, ability of utilities to invest in renewables going forward are all important things that need to be in the bill, and if they\u2019re not, it\u2019s not as beneficial for ratepayers in the state. Paul Patterson : Okay, I got you. Then with the energy efficiency, if those changes did take place, do you think that would have a meaningful impact on your retail sales growth? Brian Tierney : We do not. Paul Patterson : Okay, thanks so much. Brian Tierney : Thanks Paul. Operator : Next, we go to the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Michael Lapides : Hey guys. Brian, thanks for taking the question. Just curious, can you remind us what the sensitivity to changes in weather normalized demand are in terms of meeting not just current year guidance but your multi-year growth rate? I ask, and I know it\u2019s only one quarter, but some of the demand metrics on the commercial side seem pretty weak and that\u2019s obviously--you know, you get a lot of demand from industrial but it tends to be lower margin, but commercial and residential tends to be higher margin. Brian Tierney : We\u2019re trying to look up what those sensitivities are right now. We think that we\u2019re on track to get where we need to be for the year, even though we\u2019re slightly off for the first quarter. Again, we make more from places where we sell integrated utility products than just the T&D side, but for changes--you know, 5% change in res--I\u2019m sorry, half a percent change in residential is half a penny for T&D utilities. For vertically integrated utilities, it\u2019s 1.4%. Commercial again is about half that, half a percent change; for vertically integrated utilities, it is seven-tenths of a penny. For T&D utilities, it\u2019s a tenth of a penny, and for industrial sales half a percent change is the same as it is for commercial, seven-tenths of a penny for vertically integrated and a tenth of a penny for T&D utilities. Michael Lapides : Got it, thank you. One other question - just trying to think about Texas. What\u2019s driving the under-earning in Texas? I mean, Texas is a state where you\u2019ve got both transmission and distribution cost recovery riders, so just curious what\u2019s the biggest driver of the regulatory lag you\u2019re experiencing now? Brian Tierney : There\u2019s a couple things going on there, Michael. One is the fact that we are investing so much in the state that even with those very timely recoveries, we just can\u2019t keep up with the amount of capital that we\u2019re putting to work in the state. Second thing is as we go in for the base rate case this year, we need to suspend those short term trackers for the near term until we get everything caught up in the base rate case, and then we can put those trackers back in the space. That is going to cause a little bit of lag this year and next year as well. Michael Lapides : Got it, thanks Brian. Much appreciated. Brian Tierney : Thanks Michael. Operator : Next we go to the line of Andrew Weisel. Please go ahead. Andrew Weisel : Hey, good morning everybody. Congratulations on the PSO outcome. My question there is does this change your capex plan at all? With a transmission tracker, would you consider increasing capex at PSO, and would that drive an increase of the overall spending or would it be shifted away from other subsidiaries? I see the pie chart is unchanged, but just wondering how to think about that. Brian Tierney : What this means for us is that Oklahoma is open for business again, so we had previously, when we were under that prolonged period of under-earning at PSO, we had shifted capital to more welcoming jurisdictions that allowed us to have higher ROEs and that had trackers. Now that we have appropriate trackers in Public Service of Oklahoma, we\u2019re going to shift capital that had been shifted away from Oklahoma back into the state and have that benefit the ratepayers and customers in that state. It\u2019s not so much a huge increase, although it is, but we\u2019re shifting dollars back in that had been shifted out, and that\u2019s positive for PSO. Andrew Weisel : Makes a lot of sense. My other question is on Ohio wind. My understanding is you\u2019re able to own up to 450 megawatts out of the 500 planned. My question is for the portion signed through PPA, would you expect a debt equivalency cost mechanism? I know you have that for solar, but it\u2019s small. How do you think about that for wind PPAs? Brian Tierney : Yes, we would expect a debt equivalency on those as well. If our utilities balance sheets are being consumed to support PPAs, we need to be compensated for that, and the rating agencies ding us for those and we need to make sure that we\u2019re filling in the gap that we\u2019re getting dinged for by entering into those PPAs. We think debt equivalency is appropriate really on all renewable PPAs that we don\u2019t own. Andrew Weisel : Okay. I know there\u2019s not a lot of precedent - obviously Michigan just settled upon that. You used the word need twice in your answer there. Is that a nice to have, or a must have? Brian Tierney : How can I say this? It\u2019s appropriate to have them and it\u2019s inappropriate not to have them. Andrew Weisel : Fair enough. Thank you very much. Brian Tierney : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Angie Storozynski with Macquarie. Please go ahead. Angie Storozynski : Thank you. I wanted to go back to 2019 guidance. The Sempra acquisition came earlier than expected, and you mentioned that it would be earnings accretive this year. The Oklahoma rate case settlement was better than expected, so what\u2019s the negative offsets that you\u2019re still in the middle of the range? Brian Tierney : There\u2019s a couple things going on. In addition to the Sempra acquisition, there are also some financing costs associated with that, so we do expect gen and marketing to be ahead a couple pennies, we expect corporate and other to be a drag as we finance that. Our AEP transmission holdco, while improving, is not going to be as strong as what we thought it was going to be when we provided guidance due to some tracking items on O&M and due to our inability to get everything into the capital base that we thought we would be the end of last year. So like any year, there are things that are positive, there are things that are negative as we work our way through the year, and we still anticipate being in the midpoint of the guidance range. Angie Storozynski : Okay. The Swepco and PSO renewables, can we assume that all of these assets would be rate based? Brian Tierney : Yes, that\u2019s what the RFP asked for - build, operate, transfer two PSO and Swepco projects, and that\u2019s largely how people responded, and we would anticipate owning them and that\u2019s how we\u2019ll file with the commissions in July. Angie Storozynski : Okay, thank you. Brian Tierney : Thank you, Angie. Operator : As a reminder, if you do wish to ask a question, please press star, one. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Lonegan with Evercore. Please go ahead. Greg Gordon : Hi, it\u2019s Greg Gordon, how are you doing? Brian Tierney : Hey Greg. Greg Gordon : Just a follow-up on Paul Patterson\u2019s question on the reversal of the seat test issue. When you initially booked that in the first instance, was that also considered an operating item, so this is kind of equal opportunity - it was a drag in that year, and now that you reversed it, it\u2019s a help, but in all cases you\u2019re consistently applying that methodology? Brian Tierney : Absolutely, Greg. It was GAAP and operating in both periods. Greg Gordon : Okay, thank you. Just wanted to clarify that. The second thing, just as a follow-up to Angie\u2019s question, I just want to make sure that I\u2019m not getting the implication wrong when you said that you\u2019re going to be ahead in the renewables business but then you have the financing costs associated with financing Sempra. Is the implication that the Sempra transaction is not really accretive on an earning basis in \u201919, and if not so, what\u2019s the math there and how does that trend over time? Brian Tierney : No Greg, it will be accretive in \u201919, it will be accretive going forward. Remember the financing was larger than what was needed just for that one project, but it\u2019s an accretive project in the current period and in forward periods, inclusive of financing costs. Greg Gordon : Ah, I understand, but then part of that equity was allocated to just general corporate needs, and we have to think about it that way? Brian Tierney : That\u2019s correct. Greg Gordon : Okay, thank you. Brian Tierney : Thank you, Greg. Operator : We have no further questions in queue at this time. Bette Jo Roza : Okay, well thank you everyone for joining us on today\u2019s call. As always, the IR team will be available to answer any additional questions you may have. Ryan, would you please give the replay information? Operator : Certainly. Ladies and gentlemen, as you heard, this conference is available for replay.

[Operator Instructions]As a reminder, today's call is being recorded, and replay information will be given out at the conclusion of the conference. I will now turn the call over to your host, Bette Jo Rosa. Please go ahead. Bette Jo Rozsa : Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the second quarter 2019 earnings call for American Electric Power. Thank you for taking the time to join us today.Our earnings release, presentation slides and related financial information are available on our website, at aep.com. Today, we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors.Our presentation also includes references to non-GAAP financial information. Please refer to the reconciliation of the applicable GAAP measures provided in the appendix of today's presentation.Joining me this morning for our opening remarks are Nick Akins, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and Brian Tierney, our Chief Financial Officer. We will take your questions following their remarks.However, before I turn the call over to Nick, I would like to share with you that this will be my last earnings call here at AEP. After 39 years with the company, including 22 years in IR, I have decided to retire effective September 30.While I thoroughly enjoy my role here at AEP and interacting with all of you, there are other adventures I would like to explore and decided now is the right time. Nick and Brian have graciously invited me to come to EEI Fall Conference so that I can say goodbye to you, and I look forward to seeing you there.In the meantime, I'm leaving you all in very good hands with Darcy Reese, who most of you already know; and our new addition to IR, Tom Scott, who many of you will get to meet in the coming months.I will now turn the call over to Nick. Nick Akins : Thanks, Bette Jo. Before I get started with the earnings call, I would like to recognize Bette Jo for the wonderful job she's done representing this company and our investors. I am a CEO that's been trained by Bette Jo Rosa. I have the permanent bruises on my shins to prove it. I've looked to her for guidance, no pun intended, with the message of our company, and we will sorely miss her.She mentioned to me that she actually did our first earnings call and has done all of them since. 114 years of earnings call is a lot, just kidding. She's been with the company 39 years, and we have done earnings calls beginning in 2009. So again, Bette Jo, thank you.Now off to the second quarter. We are doing this a little differently this time. I'm deferring the actual discussion of the GAAP and operating financial performance to Brian's part of the presentation other than to say it was another steady-as-she-goes quarter with financial operating performance consistent with our expectations.So no surprise there. We continue to confirm our operating guidance for the year of $4 to $4.20 per share for the year and our long-term 5% to 7% growth rate.And of course, our Board earlier this year approved the second quarter dividend consistent with our financial plan, which Brian will also cover in more detail. While the financials for the quarter met our expectations, there were some important catalysts for future growth that developed during the quarter.I'll continue by covering those as well as other highlights and topics for the quarter that we believe you might all be interested in. First, we made several wind resource filings in Arkansas, Louisiana, Texas and Oklahoma and our SWEPCO and PSO operating companies consistent with our integrated resource plan expectations.SWEPCO and PSO are seeking regulatory approvals to acquire three wind generation facilities currently under development in North Central Oklahoma that total 1,485 megawatts. Hence, the name North Central Wind Initiatives. These projects are being developed by Invenergy and will be acquired on a fixed price turn-key basis at COD.If approved, 200 megawatts will be acquired by the end of 2020 with the balance being acquired at the end of 2021. This $2 billion regulated investment opportunity represents a unique win-win for customers and shareholders. The investment is expected to both lower customer rates and provide a long-term earnings opportunity for shareholders.Customer benefits total approximately $3 billion nominal cost net of costs over the 30-year life of the facilities. The investments produce near-term customer savings and positive customer benefits under a wide array of power natural gas and production sensitivities. We are seeking timely regulatory approvals in each estate in order to take advantage of the expiring federal PTC.The net value of the PTC is accrued to our customers total approximately at $1.4 billion and offset nearly 70% of the total capital investment over the first 10 years of the projects. The acquisition can be scaled subject to commercial limitations to align with individual state resource needs and approvals. We have the ability to take a minimum of 810 megawatts and then provide states the ability to take more megawatts should another state or states reject our applications.And we have designed enough flexibility into our applications to move forward under scenarios where only one, two, three, or four states approve. These highly efficient 44% capacity factor wind investments will serve to further diversify our generation fuel mix and act as a valuable fuel price hedge for our customers over the long-term.So, you might wonder why we didn't acquire for the full 2,200 megawatts that our SWEPCO and PSO integrated resource plans propose. Because these projects were competitively bid, we recognized the clear breakpoint between the winning three projects that happen to be Invenergy Projects who we had worked with in the past and others from a pricing perspective.We wanted to position the best projects first and clear winners from an end-of-money viewpoint so that our commissions could clearly recognize the value for our customers. We can always come in later to fill in the rest of the resource planning requirements with future bids. And we feel good about that from a risk perspective.By following the normal regulatory processes that exist with projects that clearly benefit our customers and with less risky multiple projects that are already being developed and utilization of existing SPP transmission capacity, we believe that these projects were set up for success.With our regulators, our customers, and our shareholders we learned a lot from the experience of Wind Catcher. And these filings prove that.Now onto the next hot issue, the Ohio House Bill 6 legislation. Governor DeWine earlier this week filed legislation that will provide support for the nuclear units in Ohio as well as support for the OVAC generating units. While the legislation phases out the RPS mandate after 2026, it still provides benefits for the recovery of existing renewable contracts until 2032 and provides additional support for solar projects that have already received siting approval including our 400 megawatts of proposed solar project, which can also collect from the same clean energy fund as the nuclear units.So, to reiterate, as far as AEP is concerned, we see positives from this legislation for us, namely recovery of OVAC that is collected on a statewide basis through 2030; secondly, recovery of our existing renewable contracts entered into to comply with previous legislation and approved by the PECO; the opportunity for AEP Ohio to enter into bilateral contracts with certain customers.This one is an important issue for AEP, as we have had specific requests from various customers for AEP Ohio to be the provider of renewable resources in addition to being the largest provider.And fourth, the ability for solar projects that have siting board approval to access the $20 million of the clean air funds, which includes the 400 megawatts of solar that we now have before the PECO. The access to these funds make these particular projects even more beneficial for customers.And as you recall, the request for these projects include a $6 million per year debt equivalency rider to maintain AEP Ohio's capital structure. And finally, the net impact of HB6 will provide headroom to our rate payers, which will enable potential additional distribution investments to improve the customer experience and grid reliability.AEP does believe in the importance of nuclear generation as a part of the portfolio of this country and the state of Ohio. We congratulate speaker householders, senate President Obhof, Governor DeWine, Lieutenant Governor Husted, and Chairman Randazzo along with many other members of the Ohio legislature and balancing the interest of the need for a balance portfolio, employment and economic development issues, and customer benefit.I also do not think we should view this as the end of energy policy activities in Ohio. From our perspective, HB247 that includes provisions for grid modernization and behind-the-meter technologies is important.This legislation would clarify the ability for AEP Ohio to continue to deliver emerging technologies to our customers that not only improve your customer experience but enhances grid resiliency and efficiency. This is a critical area to provide clarity regarding these types of investments that will define the future of the electric utility. HB247 will continue review in the house with hearings expected in September.And AEP believes this to be the companion bill that will complete a redefinition of Ohio energy policy. Another legislative session that just concluded was in Texas that provided some important wins for SWEPCO and AEP Texas.SWEPCO can now recover reasonable costs for deployment of advanced metering technologies while providing customer protections. AMI technology has been implemented in the ERCOT portion of Texas but not in the SWEPCO Texas jurisdiction. So, we are pleased that that can proceed.Also, new legislation allows SWEPCO to obtain approval for a rider from the PECT to recover the investment and power generation facilities outside of a rate case when the generation goes into operation with certain provisions being made for subsequent rate case timing and the size of the investment.Also affecting both SWEPCO and AEP Texas, the legislature passed Senate Bill 1938, a roper bill that clarifies rules regarding the investment in any new interconnected transmission facilities. Yesterday, we announced the purchase of 227 megawatts, 75% interest in the Santa Rita Wind Farm for approximately $356 million. This is just another example of our continued growth consistent with a capital plan for our contracted renewables business.We also could not be more pleased with the outcome of the purchase of the Sempra Wind assets. We are already seeing the prospects of this business continue to grow beyond the value of the original deal financial expectations.Not only are earnings so far from the business toward the upper end of our acquisition modeling, but the development projects are moving along nicely as well. AEP Clean Energy Resources is close to completing negotiations related to the construction of one of these development projects that uses the safe harbor equipment.This project, along with others amounting to 1,000 megawatts are in various stages of development. This business now has committed $1.5 billion of the $2.2 billion committed at EEI last November, so very good progress there.Brian will be discussing the economy in load in a few minutes in more detail, but I will say while we have seen areas of load decline, primarily tariff-related, we do expect better performance from our load growth in the second half of the year as a result of a number of new customers for expansions that will come on board primarily in the oil and gas area and data center load areas.The biggest economic headwind we have at this point is the impact of the trade war on the businesses in AEP's service territory. The increasing number of tariffs on goods beyond steel and aluminum have impacted export manufacturers in our service territory.Certainly, the trade wars have weakened the world economy and caused a strengthening U.S. dollar, which adds even more of a hurdle. Hopefully, all of this can get resolved during the election season, since a strong economy is one of President Trump's major reelection tenets.So, we will continue to monitor this closely as we move forward in finalizing our expectations for next year regarding load growth. Because the rate cases I&M, SWEPCO Arkansas and AEP Texas are in their initial stages, I'll cover them as we go through the equalizer chart. So, we'll go through that.Turning to that chart on page 5, AEP's overall regulated operations, ROE, is currently 9.7% versus 10.1% last quarter. The primary reason for the decrease in quarter two 2019 versus quarter one 2019 was the significantly unfavorable weather versus the year before and lower normalized load, mainly in our vertically integrated utilities.Looking at the individual companies, the ROE for AEP Ohio at the end of the second quarter was 12.2%. We expect to end 2019 in this 12.5% to 13% range as we continue to invest in the distribution's smart grid, partially offset by the legacy fuel carrying charges rolling off.The ROE for Appalachian Power at the end of the second quarter was 8.9% compared to 9.5% at the end of first-quarter 2019. APCO's change in ROE from the previous quarter is primarily attributable to stronger weather results in second-quarter 2018 versus this year. Lower normalized margins also contributed to lower ROE, but this was offset by the payable rate receding in West Virginia.The ROE for Kentucky power at the end of the second quarter 2019 was 7.6% compared to 8.6% at the end of first-quarter 2019. Kentucky's second-quarter ROE versus the first quarter was down primarily due to unfavorable weather and unfavorable transmission true-up. We are working on optimizing revenue and scrutinizing the OEM and capital to improve ROE by the end of the year.The ROE for I&M at the end of the second quarter was 11.1%. I&M's positive performance in the second quarter was primarily driven by timing of expenses and multiple one-time adjustments. I&M expects to end the year with an ROE around 10%, which is in-line with the authorized ROEs in Indiana and Michigan.I&M continues to successfully execute its capital programs in generation transmission and distribution and recently filed future-test, your rate cases in both Indiana and Michigan to seek timely recovery of the ongoing capital cost.In Indiana, I&M followed for a $94 million net increase with a 10.5% request at ROE. Intervener testimony is due in August. And hearings are anticipated in October with an expected effective date March 2020.In Michigan, I&M filed for a net increase of $52 million with a 10.5% ROE. Intervener testimony is due in October. And hearings will occur in November with a commission order expected in April of 2020. The ROE for PSO at the end of the second quarter was 8.4%. PSO received an order on its base case settlement in March 2019, which contained an important provision for a full transmission tracker and a partial distribution tracker.With the continued implementation of new base rates and tracker, we believe that PSO will earn its authorized ROE by the end of the year. The ROE for SWEPCO at the end of the second quarter was 5.9% versus 7.2% at the end of first-quarter 2019. The most recent 12-month ROE decreased primarily due to unfavorable weather, loss of normalized load margins, and the 2018 wholesale formula rate true-up.However, the PECT approved the company's TCRF settlement in July, which will produce approximately $11 million of additional annual revenue. Additionally, we filed in Arkansas an Arkansas base rate case in February 2019. SWEPCO's ROE continues to be affected by the Arkansas share of the Turk plant that is not in retail rates. And this impacts the ROE by about 125 basis points. SWEPCO filed in Arkansas for a net increase of $34 million, which is the $46 million minus $12 depreciation with 10.5% ROE.Arkansas Public Service Commission staff recommended a $20 million increased based upon a 9.5% ROE. The filing provides for SWEPCO's movement to an annual, formula-based rate review mechanism. Hearings are expected in October with new rates expected to go in effect in early 2020. The ROE for AEP Texas at the end of the second quarter was 8.5%. The reason for the increased ROE this quarter is primarily due to a one-time deferral of previously reported interest expense approved for recovery in the AEP Texas storm cost securitization financing order issued in June 2019.We expect the ROE to decline by year-end due to lag associated with the timing of annual filings and our base rate review filed with the PUCT on May 1, 2019. During a rate review year, there is a lag associated with these filings. Continued high levels of investment will continue to have an impact on the ROE in 2019. Regarding the rate review, we filed a net increase of $35 million with 10.5% ROE.Intervener testimony is due today, and hearings are set for August with an expected effective date in first quarter 2020. The ROE for AEP transmission holdco at the end of the second quarter 2019 was 10.6%. AEP transmission holdco quarter two ROE is higher than quarter one due to a favorable change in one-time events such as the prior year true-up in June. Regarding the FERC 206 filings in the AEP east and west territories, we have obtained settlement orders in both cases.In May, the FERC issued a settlement approval order for the east territory of AEP that includes a base ROE of 9.85%, effective January 1, 2018 with a total ROE of 10.35% including the 50 basis point RTO adder. The settlement includes a cap on the equity portion of the cap structure at 55%.In the west transmission area, the FERC issued an order at the end of June that includes a base ROE of 10%, effective back to the date of the first complaint. This is a total ROE of 10.5% including the 50 basis point RTO adder. There are no caps on the equity portion of the cap structure. And implementation of the new rates will occur in third quarter. Refunds for prior periods will be made part of the annual true-ups. And the parties agreed not to seek any change in the ROE prior to January 2021.So all-in-all, another great quarter, particularly with the headwinds of tariff-related economic conditions. The second quarter still met expectations financially but more importantly, the predicate has been set for some important growth opportunities. I would be remiss in not mentioning an evolving side of the earnings growth equation bending the OEM curve.In the face of operational challenges that the industry has recently faced, operational excellence is paramount as the foundation of AEP's ability to advance the creativity and innovation necessary to move our company forward in our transformation to be the premium utility of the future.Technology innovations through digitization and automation is absolutely required to get us there. There will be more to come in November EEI, but I just want to give you a couple of examples that we have implemented in this phase. One, we call the asset damage assessment tool, ADAT, that digitizes information to more effectively screen facility locates for underground facilities.We expect to be able to clear a request without sending crews for inspection as we do today, saving time and resources. And two, our breaker shot digital maintenance platform where digitized real-time information will improve efficiency, thereby allowing more preventative maintenance inspections of our over 7,500 generation related breakers to be brought in-house as opposed to more expensive outside contractors being used for the work.Just a couple of examples, but many others will continue to move the needle on reducing OEM and provide better service to our customers. These efforts remind me of a drummer that creates new rhythms that can only be grounded by the rudiments or fundamentals of drumming. A lot of practice to develop muscle memory and the creativity to develop new complicated rhythms that redefine the notion of operating rhythm.As an example, just listen to a famous drummer, Gavin Harrison, who played an unusual 7/4 time signature beat in Sound of Muzak, which M-U-Z-A-K, if you're looking it up by Porcupine Tree. A great sounding song but very difficult to learn and play. This is what AEP is in the process of doing now, focusing on the fundamentals of operational excellence to provide the muscle memory while establishing the culture of creativity and innovation necessary to define a new operating rhythm of technology deployment to bend the OEM curve and find new avenues for growth.So, while this quarter is another solid quarter, just know that we are feverishly in the background driving forward and providing future shareholder value and improving our customer's experience. Brian? Brian Tierney : Thank you, Nick and good morning, everyone. I will take us through the second quarter and year-to-date financial results, provide some insight on load in the economy, and finish with a review of our balance sheet and liquidity. Let's stop briefly on Slide 6, which shows the comparison of GAAP to operating earnings for the quarter and the year-to-date periods.GAAP earnings for the second quarter were $0.93 per share compared to $1.07 per share in 2018. GAAP earnings through June were $2.10 per share compared to $2 per share in 2018. There is a reconciliation of GAAP to operating earnings in the appendix. Let's go into the detail on Slide 7 and look at the drivers of quarterly operating earnings by segment.Operating earnings for the second quarter were $1 per share or $494 million compared to $1.01 per share or $498 million in 2018. Operating earnings for the vertically integrated utilities were $0.38 per share, down $0.18. Weather was the largest driver of the variants this quarter down $0.13 from last year, driven by the warmer than normal temperatures experienced in the spring of 2018.Normalized load was also unfavorable with decreases across all classes. We will talk more in detail about our normalized load and regional economies a little bit later. Rate changes helped offset these declines. You can see other smaller impacts for this segment listed on the slide.The transmission and distribution utility segment earned $0.27 per share, up $0.04 from last year. Favorable items included rate changes and recovery of increased transmission investment in ERCOT as well as favorable carrying charges and taxes. These favorable items were partially offset by higher depreciation and property taxes on the increased investment and higher O&M due to storms.The AEP transmission holdco segment continued to grow, contributing $0.31 per share, an improvement of $0.10 over last year. This growth reflected the return on incremental rate base as well as the impacts of the annual true-up and a favorable FERC settlement. Net plant increased by $1.4 billion or 19% since June of last year. Generation and marketing produced earnings of $0.06 per share, up $0.01 from last year, primarily driven by the growing renewables business and the repowering of Trent Mesa and Desert Sky as well as the acquisition of the Sempra Wind assets.Corporate and other was up $0.02 primarily due to the consolidating tax items that should levelize over the year and will partially offset by higher interest expense and a positive tax adjustment from last year that did not recur.Let's turn to Slide 8 and review our year-to-date results. Operating earnings through June were $2.19 per share or $1.1 billion, compared to $1.97 per share or $972 million in 2018. Looking at the earning drivers by segment, operating earnings for the vertically integrated utilities were $1.01 per share, down $0.02 with weather subtracting $0.15 compared to last year.Normalized load was also down for the year across all classes. And depreciation increased due to incremental investment. On the positive side, rate changes added $0.18 per share. Lower O&M added $0.06. And AFUDC and transmission revenue were each favorable by $0.02. Through June, the transmission and distribution utilities segment earned $0.58 per share, up $0.09 from last year influenced by the reversal of a regulatory provision in Ohio.Other favorable drivers included higher rate changes and transmission revenue as well as favorable carrying charges and taxes. Partially offsetting these favorable items were higher depreciation and property taxes from increased investment as well as higher O&M and unfavorable weather.The AEP transmission holdco segment contributed $0.57 per share, up $0.15 from last year. This growth in earnings reflected our return on incremental rate base as well as the impact of the annual true-up and a FERC settlement.Generation and marketing produced $0.14 per share, up $0.01 from last year. Increases in retail margins and the growth in the renewables business were offset by lower generation sales due to plant retirements and outages. Finally, corporate and other was down $0.01, primarily driven by higher interest expense in taxes, which were partially offset by lower O&M. Overall, we are pleased with our financial results and are confident in reaffirming our annual operating earnings guidance of $4 to $4.20 per share.Now let's turn to Slide 9 and update you on our load performance. Starting in the lower right chart, normalized retail sales decreased by 1.8% for the quarter compared to 2018. This decline is largely responsible for the 1% decrease in the year-to-date comparison. For both comparisons, normalized retail sales were down across all operating companies and retail classes. We now anticipate 2019 normalized sales to come in two-tenths of a percent below 2018.Moving clockwise, industrial sales decreased by 2.7% for the quarter, which brought the year-to-date comparison down to 1.5% below last year. Sales to the industrial class have been slowing in recent quarters as the impact of the strong dollar and more restrictive trade policy have challenged export manufacturers within AEP's footprint.For both the quarter and the year-to-date comparison, industrial sales were down across all operating companies with the exception of Public Service Company of Oklahoma, which benefited from increased oil and gas activity in 2019. I will provide more color on our industrial sales on the next slide.In the upper left chart, normalized residential sales decreased by 1.4%, compared to the second quarter of 2018. As described earlier, the weak second quarter performance erased the positive momentum from earlier this year, making the year-to-date comparison essentially flat. The decline in normalized usage for the quarter more than offset the four-tenths of a percent growth in customer accounts.Finally, in the upper right chart, commercial sales decreased by nine-tenths of a percent for the quarter and were down 1.3% year-to-date. For both comparisons, commercial sales were down across all operating companies. The tightening labor market and rising interest rates have limited this sector's growth in recent quarters.Turning to Slide 10, I'll provide more color with respect to our industrial sales growth. This chart shows the disparity in growth between the oil and gas sectors and all other industrial sectors. The oil and gas sector load shown in blue mirrors the pattern for oil prices. For the quarter, industrial sales in the oil and gas sectors increased by 2.8%. We expect growth in oil and gas to continue throughout 2019 based on a number of new projects identified to come online later this year, primarily in the mid and downstream part of the sector. Focusing on the red bars, the non-oil and gas industrials have struggled since the first tariffs were announced last year.For the quarter, industrial sales other than oil and gas declined by 4.6% compared to last year. Most of this slowdown can be tracked to the export industries such as chemicals manufacturing, which is down 14% for the quarter. Ironically, sales to the primary metals sector declined by 1% this quarter despite the tariffs on steel and aluminum. As discussed on previous calls, AEP has a higher exposure to trade policy given the higher concentration of export manufacturers located within the service territory.Despite these headwinds, we have a number of new industrial expansions, as I said earlier, largely focused on oil and gas. And we expect this to drive industrial sales into the positive territory for the full year. Now let's turn to Slide 11 and review the status of our regional economies. As shown in the upper left chart, GDP growth in AEP service territory was 1.8% for the quarter, which is eight-tenths of a percent below the U.S. The strongest growth for the quarter came from the AEP Texas service territory. All of our service territories experienced GDP growth with the exception of Kentucky.Moving to the upper right chart, you see that employment growth for the AEP service territory improved this quarter to 1% above last year, while U.S. growth moderated slightly in the second quarter. Throughout the AEP footprint, over 18,000 jobs were added in the second quarter with 37% of those coming from the education and healthcare sector.Other sectors that experienced strong growth and employment in the quarter included construction and natural resources and mining. Final chart at the bottom shows the income growth of AEP's footprint moderated slightly in the second quarter while U.S. income growth accelerated. For the quarter, personal incomes within AEP's service territory increased by 3.4%, which was seven-tenths of a percent below the U.S. Income growth is a key driver for residential and commercial sales.Now let's move on to Slide 11. I'm sorry. Let's move on to slide 12 and review the company's capitalization and liquidity. Our debt total capital ratio increased 1% during the quarter to 58.8%. Our FFO to debt ratio was solidly in the BAA1 range at 15.3%. And our net liquidity stood at about $2.6 billion supported by our revolving credit facility. Our qualified pension funding decreased approximately 2% to 96%. And our OPEB funding decreased approximately 1% to 130%. A drop in interest rates with the largest driver in the decreased funding status with strong equity and fixed income returns helped offset much of the liability increases.Let's try to wrap this up on Slide 13, so we can get to your questions. We have successfully achieved outcomes in all expected regulatory cases. And we will work with our regulators to obtain approval in the North Central Wind initiative benefiting our PSO and SWEPCO customers. Our year-to-date performance in the stability of our regulated business model gives us the confidence to reaffirm our operating earnings guidance range of $4 to $4.20 per share.With that, I will turn the call over to the operator for your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is Greg Gordon, Evercore. Please go ahead. Nick Akins : Good morning. Greg. Greg Gordon : Good morning. Bette Jo, like an institution is leaving its very \u2013 I'm happy for you but at the same time sad that we're going to miss you. Looking forward to seeing you. That's my question. That's it. Just kidding. No, my question is with regard\u2026 Nick Akins : Ask her if she's going to stay longer. Greg Gordon : My question is with regard just a little bit more thought perhaps on what's going on, on the demand side. I mean, clearly, on the industrial side, you've been upfront on saying that things are a little bit behind plan. And you point to the trade tensions and other factors. At the same time, it looks like the demand from the oil and gas sectors remain strong except, we're seeing signs of significant weakening and activity there in real-time. So how do you guys manage around the potential volatility in those areas in the economy if they wind up trending weaker than planned over the next several years? Brian Tierney : Greg, we've always, of course, monitored load and what's going on with that. And we've tried to adjust over time our O&M spend in response to how load is impacted either by trade tariffs, the dollar or things like weather. And we saw that impact this quarter as well. You mentioned seeing slowdown in oil and gas. We're kind of seeing the opposite of that. We're seeing uptick in oil and gas right now including expansions through the end of the year. And whereas previously, we've seen things really on the upstream side, we're now starting to see things on the mid and downstream side as the infrastructure comes in to fulfill what's been happening in the producing part of that industry.So, we're still seeing uptick in oil and gas and anticipate increases in that throughout the balance of the year. But we are subject as everyone else to what's happening with the general economy and weather. We've been very successful in responding to that over the last several years and anticipate doing the same going forward. Nick Akins : The interesting thing is, Greg, the oil prices remain at least relatively decent and like, I guess, natural gas prices continue to be relatively low. But there's a lot of oil field activity. But also, as Brian said, the infrastructure pipeline activity continues because there's a lot of production that can't \u2013 and that's why prices are so low in live territories. They just can't get the transmission capabilities.So, a lot of work continues in that regard. The other part is even our industrial base is pretty diversified. And it's unusual to see several of them line up. Eight out of 10, I believe the sectors are decreasing. And you can really point to the tariff activity. So, if that gets resolved, we should be in much better shape in our territory. That being said, there is expansion going on. Matter of fact, there was just an announcement in Corpus Christi of a large expansion there. It was announced a couple days ago.So, we continue to see the pipeline of activity. And I think we just need to get past these tariff issues so that people really understand and companies understand the rules of the game so they can make investments. So, we'll get there. But until then, we'll do what we've always done. No matter what's going on with all the fundamentals associated with our business, we pull the levers we need to make sure externally, we revive that consistent quality of earnings going forward. So, if the economy's adjusting, we have to adjust. Greg Gordon : Clear. Thank you. Nick Akins : Yes. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith, Bank of America. Please go ahead. Nick Akins : Good morning, Julien. Alex Morgan : Good morning. This is Alex calling in for Julien. Congratulations, by the way, Bette Jo. Bette Jo Rozsa : Thank you. Alex Morgan : I have two quick questions. And one is first on Ohio. I was wondering if you have looked into and could detail the impact of decoupling from the Ohio Bill 6. I know that this is something that First Energy is exploring. And I was wondering if this could potentially be a positive for you as well. Nick Akins : Well, we're already decoupled in Ohio. So, that really isn't an issue for us. Alex Morgan : Okay, great. And then my second question is plans for AMI in SWEPCO, if this could also be another positive for the company and if so, when we might anticipate future announcements about it. Nick Akins : Yes. I think it will be positive for SWEPCO. And certainly, we want to go about the process as quickly as possible to get AMI metering put in place as a predicate for many of the technologies that we're working with. So, it's important to do that. I think you're probably going to be seeing a focus on that very soon now that the whole installation is done. Alex Morgan : Okay. Thank you. And also including Arkansas and states like that rather than just Texas? Nick Akins : Well, certainly, we'll install AMI metering wherever we can install it. And I'd have to check, but I'm pretty sure we could do that in the other states already. We just haven't gotten to the point of moving that process ahead in those jurisdictions yet, but we're getting there. Alex Morgan : Okay. Thank you so much. Thanks for taking my questions. Nick Akins : We had recently installed some AMR meters in SWEPCO. And so, we're really managing through dealing with the replacement of those at the same time of putting in AMI metering. So, it's one of those areas where timing is going to be really important. And certainly, the regulatory process will be key in terms of the implementation. Alex Morgan : Okay. Thank you again. Nick Akins : Yes. Operator : Next question is Steve Fleishman, Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Nick Akins : Good morning, Steve. Steve Fleishman : Hey. Good morning. Bette Jo, congratulations. Definitely wish you the best. Bette Jo Rozsa : Thank you. Steve Fleishman : So just \u2013 this maybe \u2013 I don't know if you have this detail, but out of curiosity, when you talk about the strength in oil and gas, is there a big difference between the AEP east and AEP west businesses? Is it mainly in the west? Brian Tierney : Yes. Steve, yes. So we're seeing it in the west, particularly in Texas and Oklahoma. Steve Fleishman : Okay. How about the AEP east oil and gas? Is that down or flat or still up? Brian Tierney : It's still up. But it's not to the degree that the west part is. Steve Fleishman : Okay. And then maybe could you just talk about maybe a little more color on the regulatory approval process on North West \u2013 North Wind and just kind of timelines and the like? Nick Akins : Yes. So, I guess, the beauty of all this is it's using the standard integrated resource plan processes. And we'll go through the normal hearings, but we're expecting to have an outcome in about a year. The filings have just been made. And obviously, we'll go through the testimony and all that kind of stuff in the meantime. We'll try to move it as expeditiously as we can to take advantage of the PTCs. But we expect the procedural schedules to come out soon, but our expectation is it'll take about a year to get those approvals. Steve Fleishman : Okay. And do you just need to prove that \u2013 you don't need to prove need, you just need to prove this is least cost or in the public interest? Nick Akins : Well, yes. That's right. There is capacity needs and TSO. And then SWEPCO is looking at it from really a customer benefit perspective. Steve Fleishman : Got it. Okay. Thank you. Nick Akins : Yes. Really nothing unusual about these filings. And that's probably the good thing. We went after Wind Catcher because it was a unique opportunity. And we certainly wanted to be able to perform that project. But it was outside the regulatory process and all that stuff. And the risk involved of large transmission. So, this is a very different proposition within the framework of the existing processes. So, we feel good about it. Steve Fleishman : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Angie Storozynski, Macquarie. Please go ahead. Angie Storozynski : Thank you. Bette Jo, congratulations. So, two questions. You mentioned that the Sempra Wind portfolio, both the operating assets and the development pipeline are actually exceeding your expectations. That together with some of the cost-cutting, is that enough to keep you in the middle of your guidance range for this year? Nick Akins : Yes, we feel good about where we stand for the guidance of this year and with the additions there along with our optimization activities. But also, we have gone through several series of rate cases in previous years that continue to benefit us as well. So, I mean, obviously, there's a lot of issues to look at, a lot of areas where \u2013 every year we have positives and negatives. But all in all, it comes down to where we fully support the guidance that we give. And I don't see an issue there at all. Angie Storozynski : Okay. And the secondly, so you have those additional growth drivers like the AMI, CapEx, potentially rate case renewables and stuff on PSO. How should we think about those? Are those going to elongate the current growth rate for the company? I.e., there's going to be some production of, say, transmission spending or some other CapEx to basically keep the growth rate changed? Or is this incremental to the current growth rate? Nick Akins : Yes. So, we continue to look at what the future holds and still an obviously long-term growth rate of 5% to 7%. We'd be disappointed if it wasn't in the upper end of that because we expect to get approvals for these additional wind projects that we haven't included in our plan. We're watching the economy obviously. And you tell me what the timing is of getting the tariff issues resolved. But they'll probably get resolve before the election I would presume. If that's the case, then we should be in really good shape.And of course, every year that goes by \u2013 we're a large company. And fueling 5% to 7% growth is more and more of a challenge. But that's why we look at things like what is going on with our contractor renewables, the value of the Sempra deal, what's going on with the regulated additions, not just regulated additions in the Western territories but in the Eastern territories as well, particularly with the legislation.And keep in mind too I think it's really important to focus on what Ohio has just done. It's opened up the ability for us to work directly with customers on the AEP Ohio side where they wanted to because there's customers who have said, we want you to do our solar projects. We want you to do the resources for these facilities. And to this point, we've been unable to say that AEP Ohio could do that. Now we can.And so, I think that's going to fuel a further expansion from a renewables standpoint and from a resource standpoint, microgrids, and so forth. And watch this House Bill 247 because I think that's really important around what we do on the digitization, automation, the technologies at the distribution side. And I continue to view the distribution wedge, capital wedge of this company continuing to grow considerably as a result of that.The other thing too is transmission. We have to spend $2.5 billion just to keep the present average age. So, if you think about that, that's a foundation.And if we ever want to advance the age, which is pretty old at this point, we have to continue to invest in a large degree in transmission to make sure that our system remains reliable and resilient.So, there's so many opportunities. Well, another one I would point out is a pilot that we're doing in Virginia right now around broadband. We're doing sort of the midstream broadband that the others, AT&T and others are supportive of us doing because we're already putting in fiber for resiliency of the grid itself in terms of analytics.There's available capacity. We can bring the rural areas closer to the urban centers as well, allow broadband to exist in these communities that don't have it today. And that's another opportunity for us to continue to go. And then classification of the economy. So, I'm bullish about the growth opportunities of this business.The question on our minds is how we manage our balance sheet around FFO to debt and those kinds of metrics and be able to address all the capital opportunities we have. And of course, that may mean recycling assets, doing what we need to do to optimize the efficiency of the use of that balance sheet. So, there's still a lot of work for us to do. There really is good work. Angie Storozynski : Just one follow-up to the balance sheet management. You never mentioned how you're going to finance those rate-based renewables at SWEPCO and PSO. Is it fair to say that this update is coming only once the approvals are in, i.e., about 12 months from now? Brian Tierney : Absolutely, Angie. So, obviously, when we talked about this opportunity, it's not what we've laid out in our current financing plans. This would be incremental to it. And we would update that as we get approvals. But I think you've seen from us in the past really putting generally equal measures of debt and equity together to finance our capital plans and really fairly conservative management of our balance sheet. And I think you'll see that continuing going forward. Angie Storozynski : Great. Thank you. Brian Tierney : Thanks. Operator : Next question is from Ali Agha, SunTrust. Please go ahead. Ali Agha : Thank you. Good morning. Bette Jo, best wishes to you as well. Bette Jo Rozsa : Thank you. Ali Agha : First question, Nick or Brian, just wanted to clarify the growth outlook. I recall I think in the past when you've talked about your base plan. And that was before you announced the wind projects and renewable projects that you thought that your base plan could track you to the high end of the 5% to 7% growth rate. Is that still your expectation? And if you get these wind approvals, could that theoretically actually take you above the 5% to 7% growth rate? Nick Akins : Well, I've always said and I continue to say we believe it certainly will make 5% to 7% more robust. And we'd be disappointed if we weren't in the upper end. And we're going have to get through and determine what happens to the load going forward. We have the growth opportunities there.But if you have tempering aspects of load growth, I think it'd be probably good for us right now to stand padded at the 5% to 7% what we said previously that we expect to be and certainly would be disappointed if we weren't in the upper end of that 5% to 7%. Ali Agha : Okay. And then more near-term again, just to clarify. You've brought down your load expectations for this year from up 1% to now slightly down. Weather obviously has been a drag. Can you just remind us in the very short-term what are sort of the immediate offsets to think about that could help you this year? Is it all O&M? Or is that something that's actually gone better than perhaps budgeted to offset that? Brian Tierney : Yes, Ali. It's a couple things. One is O&M, the other one is we've had some positive rate outcomes that have outpaced our expectations for the year. Ali Agha : I see. Okay. And then lastly, just to also clarify, assuming that the entire $2 billion management is approved, would you consider that all incremental? Or is there an opportunity for you to standout some of the base CapEx and fit it in within the current CapEx profile? Brian Tierney : We've not made a determination on that yet, Ali. Ali Agha : Gotcha. Thank you. Nick Akins : Thanks. Operator : And next question is from the line of Michael Lapides, Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Michael Lapides : Hey, guys. Morning, guys. I got a longer-term question for you. When you look around across the jurisdictions, where do you lack regulatory mechanisms that you would like to see to get put in place? Which of the jurisdictions where you think your regulatory team has the most wood to chop? And how do you think that process plays out in those few jurisdictions? What's on your wish list? Nick Akins : Yes. I have a lot of wishes. But we have about 65, two-thirds to 70% of our rate recovery is through tracker-rider mechanisms. So, we're doing pretty well from that perspective. But there are things obviously I'd like to see because the utility business right now, we're needing to invest in the resiliency and the reliability of this grid and really refurbish the grid in a major way.And that tells me that it'd be great to have more forward-looking type of test years like we do in Indiana. The formula-based rate mechanisms are really good. But there's still some wet lagging. But they're better than waiting on rate cases and stuff. And I think it's important to have mechanisms in place where there are formula-based rates, where there are forward-test years. Those kinds of things need to be in place to allow us to continue to invest and not impact our balance sheet from an FFO to debt perspective.And keep in mind, AEP did not go out for additional equity or anything with tax reforms. So, certainly, it brought our credit metrics in to something that obviously, we need to watch, particularly as you're investing capital. And then with load decreasing and revenue having an impact associated with that, that's going to further impact the FFO to debt.So, we're watching that very closely, those metrics to preserve our balance sheet. And then that's obviously something we're going have to continue to work through. So, I don't know if you have anything to add, Brian. Brian Tierney : Michael, we don't have any jurisdictions where we have real concerns any longer. There's been a lot of progress that's been made in places like Oklahoma where we still have integrated utilities, and it's not just wires only. One of the initiatives that we're working on and taking a close look at from the terms of the risk of the customer and ourselves are the depreciation rates associated with our fossil generating stations and making sure that they're in line.So, that's an initiative that all of our vertically integrated utilities are looking at. We made some headway in that in regards to the Rockport generation depreciation in Indiana where we had an offset associated with the flowback of the deferred income taxes.We were able to shorten up the depreciation period and not impact customer rates by having that offset from the deferred income tax flowback. So, that's an initiative that we're working across the jurisdictions. But kind of a blessing, we don't have any that we would call trouble jurisdictions today.The jurisdictions are operating well. And our operating companies have strong relationships with the regulators and legislatures. And we're getting good outcomes like Nick described in Ohio. So, there's no sore point that we are overly concerned about but just some broad-based initiatives that we continue to work. Nick Akins : Yes. A lot of balls on our equalizer chart, it's either because of weather or that we continue to invest heavily in these jurisdictions. But it's clearly important for us. And you're seeing advancement of formula-based rate mechanisms. Arkansas, for example. We now have some significant riders in TSO in Oklahoma.And of course, the other riders in Indiana, Michigan, and so forth. And those are beneficial. But if I look at two things forward-looking for this industry, with the issues of cyber, physical security, refurbishment of the grid, ensuring that we maintain a reliable system going forward, it's imperative that we're able to invest and recover on a timely basis. And that tells me, formula-based rates, I'll take it. Forward-test years, even better. And we need to work that around the horn across all the jurisdictions. Michael Lapides : Got it, guys. Thank you. Very thorough answer. Much appreciated. Bette Jo Rozsa : Operator, we have time for one more call. Operator : Okay. And that question is from the line of Praful Mehta, Citi. Please go ahead. Nick Akins : Good morning Praful. Praful Mehta : Hi. Morning. And congratulations, Bette Jo. All the best. Bette Jo Rozsa : Thank you. Praful Mehta : So, maybe the first question on Slide 9, where you have the industrial growth and I know you've touched on this in the past. But just wanted to confirm, year-to-date down 1.5%. But your budget clearly is positive. So, you clearly see already things that are in place that would increase in load between now and year-end. Is that right, just to confirm? Brian Tierney : That's correct, Praful. And when we see expansions that are out a year or more than a year, we need to really weight those for probability of them coming in. We feel pretty confident about things as close in as six months. Praful Mehta : Yes. Exactly. That's what I would have got. So, thanks for confirming. And secondly, maybe on the credit point that you all made because you have all these opportunities for investment, and you will be conservative by the sounds of it on the financing side, just wanted to understand how the cash effective tax rate fits into that because it's helpful, on slide 34, you've indicated around a 5% cash tax rate. Is that something that you expect will stay around that level? Or you expect that to change? And would that put any pressure on the metrics over time? Brian Tierney : So, we do expect the cash tax rate to be around that 5.25% going forward. Clearly, the flowback of the deferred taxes is a big use of our cash these days. But remember, we had gone in with this strong balance sheet before tax reform thinking we were going become a big payor of taxes. And now that we're not a big payor of taxes, we're a big flow backer of deferred income tax.I don't think that's a word. But we are now flowing back significant amounts of deferred taxes. So, for this year, given the orders that we had, we had anticipated flowing back both protected and unprotected, about $267 million. We're now going to be flowing back about $330 million in 2019. Going forward, in the next three years, we anticipate that number being a lot closer to about $200 million. Praful Mehta : Gotcha. And that was a choice in terms of flowing back more this year given you have some room on the metrics? Brian Tierney : It was a choice by our regulators. Praful Mehta : Gotcha. All right. Well, thank you so much. Really appreciate the color. Brian Tierney : Thanks Praful. Bette Jo Rozsa : Thank you for joining us on today's call. And thank you all for the kind comments on the phone and all your emails. I'm a bit overwhelmed right now. And as always, the IR team will be available to answer any additional questions you may have. Kevin, would you please give the replay information? Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, if you wish to call the replay number, you will call 1800-475-6701 with the access code 469236. International calls may dial area code 320-365-3844. Those numbers again : 1800-475-6701 with the access code 469236. International callers, 320-365-3844 with the access code of 469236. Now that does conclude your conference.

At this point, all participant lines are in a listen-only mode. There will be an opportunity for your questions and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's call is being recorded.I'll turn the call now over to Ms. Darcy Reese. Please go ahead. Darcy Reese : Thank you, John. Good morning, everyone and welcome to the third quarter 2019 earnings call for American Electric Power. Thank you for taking the time to join us today. Our earnings release, presentation slides and related financial information are available on our website at aep.com.Today we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors. Our presentation also includes references to non-GAAP financial information. Please refer to the reconciliation of the applicable GAAP measures provided in the appendix of today's presentation.Joining me this morning for opening remarks are Nick Akins, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Tierney, our Chief Financial Officer. We will take your questions following their remarks.I will now turn the call over to Nick. Nick Akins : Okay. Thanks, Darcy, and welcome to the call, your first time in the call. I'm willing Bette Jo Rozsa is still listening even though she is in retirement, but thanks for everyone for joining AEP's third quarter earnings call. Brian will update you on the financials for the quarter and year-to-date a little later, but I'll summarize my view of the quarter as we go forward.First, we had a great quarter, supported by warm weather through September, previous positive regulatory outcomes that are now being reflected in our financial results, continued success in management or O&M expenses. And I have to say, load is making a comeback. After the lower load last quarter, it is good to see some improvement that generally remains flat to last year, but still positive from the second quarter. We're watching this trend closely during the fourth quarter and into next year.Given all of that, we are raising and narrowing our operating earnings guidance range for 2019 from $4 to $4.20 per share to $4.14 to $4.24 per share with a new midpoint of $4.19 per share. We're also reaffirming our 5% to 7% growth rate based upon our original guidance. Additionally, the AEP Board earlier this week authorized an increase of $0.03 per share from $0.67 to $0.70 a share, a 4.5% increase. This increase keeps us firmly in the middle of our targeted 60% to 70% payout range. And along with last year's increase of 8.1% averages to a 6.3% increase for the last two years, commensurate with our 5% to 7% earnings growth rate. We continue to expect the dividend to grow in line with our earnings and firmly within our targeted payout ratio.So let's step into a few highlight areas for the quarter. Regarding our North Central Wind projects, as you recall we had made filings for state approvals in Oklahoma, Louisiana, Arkansas and Texas on July 15 and during the third quarter, we requested FERC approval of this transaction as well. Also we would acquired three wind farms currently under development by Invenergy within service dates in 2020 and 2021 based upon requirements consistent with the integrated resource plans of both PSO and SWEPCO in the various jurisdictions. Finalized procedural schedules have been determined in all of the state jurisdictions at this point. The Oklahoma Corporation Commission has set the PSO schedule for hearings in January of 2020.Louisiana Public Service Commission, SWEPCO Louisiana hearings for March 2020, the Arkansas Public Service Commission has also set its scheduled for March 2020, and the Public Utility Commission of Texas has set the schedule for hearings in February of 2020. So we're currently working with the discovery process in each jurisdiction, and we're on track to receive final decisions by the summer of 2020. I'll remind everyone once again that these projects are not in our capital plan.Regarding regulated solar, HB 6 has cleared the path for credits to be applied to our existing solar request before the Ohio Commission. With this change, we have followed a temporary delay to provide additional clarity concerning project benefits to our customers, and we await a decision from the PUCO. While on the subject of Ohio, we are continuing our focus on HB 247 with hearings progressing well. This bill is important in regards to further grid modernization, technology deployment and behind-the-meter customer investment opportunities to improve the customer experience.There is no doubt our business is changing at the distribution level in regards to technology, grid modernization, distributed generation and further grid and customer rate optimization efficiency opportunities. HB 247 modifies Ohio's electric retail service to allow the company to include these provisions in electric security plans filed with the PUCO. This allows us to provide that continued obligation for our customers to improve the customer experience and be able to provide universal access to the benefits of the clean energy economy.Our contracted renewables, which have benefited from the recently acquired wind facilities, development opportunities and resources, continues to perform well. The projects are performing toward the upper end of acquisition assumptions and the development portfolio is making good progress as well. We have one project that we expect to place in service in 2020 using all the PTC safe harbor equipment and expect to release an announcement of a project, backed by long-term contract with an investment grade counterparty by the end of the year and there are others in the pipeline that look really good as well.Our Regulated Utilities continue to perform very well. I just want to take a moment to congratulate our employees at the Cook Nuclear Plant that once again received an Info Excellence Rating. We are very pleased with that outcome and this exemplifies our belief that operational excellence is the foundation for anything else that AEP wishes to achieve from a strategic perspective. We're in the midst of four major rate cases that I'll update you on.In Arkansas, we followed a settlement of that case and includes all the parties that contains a net $18 million increase or 9.45% ROE with a formula base rate process for five years, because we have not filed the rate case in Arkansas on approximately 10 years. It's important to note this order included no disallowances on the $1.2 billion of investments made on generation and environmental retrofits. The company requested a $34 million net increase. So, all in all a decent settlement to move forward with a new form of base rate mechanism. The settlement of rates Arkansas Public Service Commission approval with rates assumed to go in effect in January 2020.In Indiana, we filed a case in May of 2019 for a net increase of $94 million and 10.5% ROE with a 2020 forecasted test year. The rate case includes our Innovate Indiana program that supports the continued operation of Cook nuclear plant, new smart grid technologies, AMI meters, expansion of electric vehicle charging and support for renewable energy.Testimony by I&M and intervenors have already been filed and Indiana staff does not file testimony. We filed with testimony in September and hearings are currently ongoing. We expect an order on rates to go in effect by March 2020. In Michigan, I&M filed a base rate case in June requesting a net increase of $52 million and a 10.5% ROE with also a 2020 forecasted test year.The Michigan plant also includes support for the continued operation of Cook nuclear plant, and our commitment to distribution reliability through equipment upgrades tree trimming and AMI meters. Staff and intervenor testimony has been filed with staff recommending a 9.75% ROE with a $38 million revenue increase. We'll follow a vital testimony in November with hearings also being in November and expect the commission order in April of 2020.And lastly, regarding the AEP Texas rate case, we filed in May a base rate case review that included a net increase of $35 million and a requested ROE of 10.5% with a 2018 test year. The rate request includes increased charges to retail electric provider's reps for use of AEP, Texas D&D lines, along with refunds and credits associated with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.The PUC staff August and all this testimony with reductions in both the transmission and distribution revenue requirements based upon a 9.35% ROE removing various incentive and expenses incremental distribution forestry expenses and other tax and depreciation related adjustments.The hearings concluded in August. The case has been fully briefed and we AEP from the ALJs in mid-November. We will then follow exceptions and expect a ruling from the commission in the first quarter of 2020. Summaries of all of these cases are included in the earnings slide presentation.Now moving to the economy. This quarter has indicated some bright spots to consider. Many have talked about this economy being driven forward by the consumer, because of low unemployment and higher wages. We are seeing that as well in our service territory. While industrial overall is still down, but improved from last quarter residential and commercial are both more than expected. We have the lowest unemployment on record in our territory going back to 1,990 and wages are growing faster than inflation.And even in the industrial sectors, which have improved overall from last quarter. The oil and gas sector growth was the strongest we've seen since 2016. As you know our margins are higher on residential and commercial and industrial. So overall financial results are positive. So all-in-all I would say it's time for a return of optimism regarding the economy.So, now moving to the equalizer graph. The overall regulated operations ROE is currently 10.1%. It was 9.7% last quarter. We generally project the ROE for our regulated segments to be combined to be in the 9.5% to 10% range. We have a long track record of delivering these results and we expect that to continue. The reason for the increase in third quarter 2019 versus second quarter includes the effect of favorable weather this September.I'll also not bore you the size above for you the size of in the chart. It's interesting to note that AEP Transmission Holdco is now the second largest operating utility behind Appalachian power. So that's interesting to note and you have several of them to approximately the same size companies as well that follow on to that. So we're continuing to make quite a bit of progress. And it is interesting to note.Moving on to the sale on AEP, Ohio, the ROE for AEP Ohio at the end of the third quarter was 11.3% and we expect to end 2019, 11% as the legacy fuel and capacity charges the poor and the RSR as they recalled roll off and we continue to invest in the distribution of smart grid.APCo the ROE for APCo at the end of third quarter 2019 was 9%. APCo's change in ROE from second quarter 2019 is primarily due to favorable weather and rate proceedings when comparing third quarter 2019 with third quarter 2018, partially offset by lower normalized usage in third quarter 2019 versus third quarter 2018.West Virginia. As you recall the West Virginia new base rates in March 2019 which was a $44 million base rate increase based on 9.75% ROE. Virginia's first review is in 2020 and we'll cover the 2017 to 2019 periods and ROE of 9.42% will be used for tri-annual period review was 70 basis points bandwidth ranging from 8.72% to 10.12. So that will be coming up.As far as Kentucky Power is concerned, the ROE for Kentucky Power at the end of the third quarter was 7.8%. Kentucky's change in ROE from second quarter is primarily due to slightly favorable normalized usage weather and transmission revenues. We're working on optimizing revenue and scrutinizing the OEM and capital to improve ROE by the end of the year.With I&M, I&M at the end of the third quarter was 11.6%. I&M's positive performance through the third quarter of 2019 is primarily driven by timing of expenses, favorable financing of long-term debt, supportive regulatory environments and some onetime adjustments.I&M expects to end the year with an ROE around 10.5% which is higher than authorized ROEs in Indiana and Michigan primarily due to onetime adjustments. I&M continues to successfully execute, its capital programs in generation, transmission and distribution and recently followed future test year rate cases in Indiana and Michigan to only recover your ongoing capital costs.Regarding PSO, PSO ended the quarter with an ROE at 11.3%. PSO's increase in ROE was due primarily to summer weather and normalized usage. PSO received an order in our case settlement in March 2019, as you recall approving a $46 million increase and a 9.4% ROE. So we've seen a great turnaround in Oklahoma. And in fact Oklahoma is a broad spot from the economic process as well. Oklahoma continues to operate on all cylinders and continue to increase in terms of load.SWEPCO. SWEPCO the end of third quarter 2019 was 6.7%. The most recent 12-month ROE increased primarily due to favorable weather and favorable normalized load. We did as I mentioned follow the Arkansas base rate case and the settlements that are pending there and an ROE of 9.45% and cash structure of 52.1% debt and 47.9% equity.SWEPCO's ROE continues to be affected by the Arkansas share of the Stuart plant that is not in retail rates. As far as Texas is concerned, the ROE for AEP Texas at the end of the third quarter was 8.8%. The main driver for the increase in ROE is primarily due to favorable summer weather. We expect the ROE to decline by year-end due to lag associated with the timing of annual filings and the base rate review filed with the PUCT in May.Favorable regulatory treatment has allowed us to file annual DCRF and bi-annual filings and recover our costs on distribution and transmission related capital investments. But during a rate review year there is a lag associated with these filings. In addition continued high levels of investment and timing of our planned comprehensive rate review will continue to have the impact on ROE and AEP Texas in 2019.And then the ROE for AEP Transmission Holdco at the end of the third quarter was 11.4%. AEP's transmission Holdco, ROE was higher than second quarter 2019 driven by the prior year radial impact adjustment falling off and higher revenues due to differences between actual and forecasted revenues in third quarter. Transmission is forecasting a higher ROE than authorized at the end of fiscal 2019 as a result of higher revenues and a prior year favorable true up.So as we as we look forward to EEI, you can expect AEP to give further updates regarding continued affirmation of our 5% to 7% growth rate, details of capital plans, additional focus on OEM-related initiatives and any further updates on renewables, rate cases and other matters.There's no question AEP continues to fire in all cylinders as we continue our promise of being a premium regulated utility with the consistency and quality of earnings and dividends that our shareholders expect. We reiterate our intention of achieving the higher end of our 5% to 7% growth rate. We'd be disappointed not to achieve it. We believe the foundation is there to achieve just that.As the Duty Brothers one of the latest nominees and it's about time they were an nominee for the Rock Hall of fame this year, said we got to let the music play what the people need is a way to make them small. Well that's what we want for our investors and we intend on letting a great AEP team play, so listen to the music. Brian? Brian Tierney : Thank you Nick and good morning everyone. I will take us through the third quarter and year-to-date financial results, provide some update on more than the economy review our balance sheet and liquidity and finish with a preview of what we will present at the EEI Conference.Let's talk briefly on Slide 6 which shows the comparison of GAAP to operating earnings for the quarter and year-to-date periods. GAAP earnings for the third quarter were $1.49 per share compared to $1.17 per share in 2018. GAAP earnings through September were $3.58 per share compared to $3.17 per share in 2008. There is a reconciliation of GAAP to operating earnings in the release.Let's get into the detail on Slide 7 and look at the drivers of quarterly operating earnings by segment. Operating earnings for the third quarter were $1.46 per share or $722 million compared to $1.26 per share or $619 million in 2018. Operating earnings for Vertically Integrated Utilities were $0.89 per share up $0.18 primarily driven by rate changes which were favorable by $0.07. Weather was also favorable this quarter up $0.04 from last year. Smaller impacts for this segment are listed on the slide.The Transmission & Distribution Utilities segment earned $0.27 per share down $0.03 from last year. Earnings in this segment declined due to the roll-off of legacy riders in Ohio and higher O&M, depreciation and property taxes. These items were partially offset by recovery of increased transmission investment in ERCOT, weather and rate changes.The AEP Transmission Holdco segment continued to grow contributing $0.25 per share, an improvement of $0.10 over last year. This growth reflected the return on incremental rate base as well as the impact of a non-recurring prior year accounting adjustment.Net plant increased by $1.4 billion or 18% since September of last year. Generation & Marketing earned $0.16 per share up $0.08 from last year primarily driven by favorable taxes that will levelize over the year. This segment reflects the growth in the renewables business and favorable wholesale margins.Corporate and Other was down $0.13 primarily due to tax items that will levelize over the year as well as higher O&M and interest expense.Let's turn to slide 8 and review our year-to-date results. Operating earnings through September were $3.65 per share or $1.8 billion compared to $3.23 per share or $1.6 billion in 2018.Looking at the earnings drivers by segment. Operating earnings for Vertically Integrated Utilities were $1.9 per share up $0.16 with rate changes being the largest driver in the segment. Other positive items included lower O&M and taxes as well as higher AFUDC. While weather was favorable compared to normal, it was unfavorable compared to last year subtracting $0.12.Normalized load was also down for the year and depreciation increased due to incremental investment. Through September, the Transmission & Distribution Utilities segment earned $0.85 per share up $0.07 from last year influenced by the reversal of a regulatory provision in Ohio.Other favorable drivers included higher rate relief and ERCOT transmission revenue as well as favorable carrying charges in Texas, partially offsetting these favorable items with the roll-off of legacy riders in Ohio, unfavorable weather, higher depreciation property taxes and O&M.The AEP Transmission Holdco segment contributed $0.82 per share up $0.25 from last year. This growth in earnings reflected a return on incremental rate base, a favorable annual true-up in FERC settlement, higher AFUDC and the non-recurring prior year accounting adjustments.Generation & Marketing produced $0.30 per share. The renewables business grew with the repowering of Trent Mesa and Desert Sky as well as the acquisition of multiple renewable assets. Increases in retail and wholesale margins were partially offset by lower generation sales due to lower energy prices, plant retirements and outages.Finally, Corporate and Other were down $0.15 driven by higher tax expense primarily from consolidating tax items that will reverse by year-end with a tenure relating to prior period tax adjustments. Interest expense was also higher.Overall, we are pleased with our financial results and are confident in raising and narrowing our annual operating earnings guidance to $4.14 per share to $4.24.Now let's turn to slide 9 to provide an update on our system load. Starting in the lower right chart, normalized retails sales were essentially flat for the quarter compared to 2018. This represents a marked improvement from our last quarterly update.Third quarter sales are up at the Transmission & Distribution Utilities and public service company in Oklahoma while the remaining Vertically Integrated Utilities experienced the decline. For the year-to-date comparison, AEP's normalized retail sales were down six-tenths of a percent from last year.Through September, the growth in residential sales has being offset by decline in commercial and industrial sales. You will notice that our latest year end estimate is projecting normalized retail sales we'll finish the year down five-tenths of a percent from 2018. The mix of sales -- of sales growth combined with rate design nuances give us confidence in our 2019 guidance in light of our load outlook. I'll cover rate design later in the presentation.Moving to the upper left chart. Normalized residential sales increased by seven-tenths of a percent for the quarter. Customer count growth was responsible for three-tenths of a percent increase while the remaining four-tenths was due to improvement in normalized usage.Third quarter residential sales were up at several of our operating companies with the exceptions of Appalachian Power, I&M and SWEPCO. Year-to-date normalized residential sales increased by two-tenths of a percent, which was mostly driven by an increase in residential customer count.The uptick in residential sales this year is consistent with macroeconomic drivers. Unemployment rates across the AEP service territory are at record lows. Tight labor market has created upward pressure on the wages. This has allowed personnel income to grow faster than inflation through most of 2019. As incomes rise, customers tend to purchase more electricity and consuming products.Moving to the upper right chart. Normalized commercial sales increased by four-tenths of a percent for the quarter. The results varied by operating company but were strongest in the Transmission & Distribution Utilities segment. Seven of our top 10 commercial sectors posted growth this quarter with the strongest growth coming from the utilities, hospitals and accommodation sectors. Through September, normalized commercial sales were down seven-tenths of a percent from last year.Not surprising the sector that posted the biggest draft in commercial sales was traditional retail. As you can see on this chart there has been a consistent improvement over the last 12 months in commercial sales growth.Finally in the lower left chart, industrial sales decreased by 1.1% for the quarter, which brought the year-to-date comparison to 1.4% below last year. For both periods industrial sales were down at most operating companies with the exception of PSO which has experienced double-digit growth from oil and gas activity. We are fortunate to have these sectors in our industrial mix. The impact of the General Motors strike on our load was negligible.Turning to Slide 10, I'll provide a brief update with respect to industrial sales growth by sector. This chart shows the distinction growth between the oil and gas sectors and all other industrial sectors. Industrial sales to oil and gas industries increased by 7.8%, which was the strongest growth in these sectors since the first quarter of 2016.This was largely driven by the 16.3% growth in the pipeline and transportation sector. Most of the growth in the quarter was a result of a number of anticipated expansions that will address congestion issues coming out of the major shale regions in our service territory. There are still additional oil and gas related expansions in the development pipeline that will provide more growth over the next 18 months.Focusing your attention on the green bars, the non-oil and gas industrials were down for the quarter but lesser than last quarter. For the AEP system, chemicals manufacturing and transportation equipment manufacturing accounted for most of this impact.Now let's turn to Slide 11 and review the status of our regional economies. As shown in the left chart, GDP growth in AEP service territory was 2.4% for the quarter, which is 0.3% above the U.S. The strongest growth for the quarter came from our Oklahoma service territory. All of our service territories experienced GDP growth for the quarter.Moving to the right chart, you see an employment growth for the AEP service territory improved this quarter to 0.8% above last year while U.S. growth moderated slightly in the third quarter. Throughout the AEP footprint, nearly 16000 jobs were added in the third quarter with 42% of those coming from the education and health care sector.Turning to Slide 12. I want to point a nuance related to customer class rate design. Some 72% of industrial rates across our system are fixed rather than variable, a 1% decline in industrial load is much less impactful than a 1% decline in residential load, where 82% of the rate is variable. For your reference, a 1% change in industrial sales is worth about $0.02 per share.Now let's move on to Slide 13 and review the company's capitalization and liquidity. Our debt to total capital ratio improved slightly during the quarter to 58.7%. Our FFO to debt ratio was solidly in the BAA1 range at 15.2% and our net liquidity stood at about $2.6 billion supported by our revolving credit facility.Our qualified pension funding decreased approximately 2% to 94%, a drop in interest rates increased the pension liability here. OPEB funding decreased approximately 7% to 123%. This was a result of lower interest rates and a new OPEB liability experience study both of which increased the OPEB liability.Let's try and wrap this up on Slide 14 and get to your questions. The strong results we delivered year-to-date and our confidence in our plan for the remainder of the year allow us to raise and narrow the operating earnings guidance range to $4.14 per share to $4.24.Our message at EEI will be that we are the premium regulated utility, delivering 5% to 7% earnings growth with dividends growing in line with earnings. Our plan has line of sight transparency to growth and has greatly reduced execution risk. We will provide detailed drivers for 2020 earnings by segment and updates to our capital expenditure and financing plans.One final item. We have historically released fourth quarter and full year earnings in January of the subsequent year. In 2020, we released 2019 full year and fourth quarter earnings in late February, more coincident with the following of the 2019 10-K. We look forward to seeing many of you in Orlando in a couple of weeks.And with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And first in the line Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, good morning. Nick Akins : Hey, Julien. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: So, perhaps if I can go back to some of the commentaries on the last call and brief, certainly some variations across the service territory on your sales trends would be curious, how does this position you relative to your broad plans and thought process against the 5% to 7%? Just want to be exceptionally clear, as you think about having closed some good results here in the third quarter and again reaffirming the higher end? Nick Akins : Yes, there is no change in our thought process. We're still tracking 5% to 7%. We disappointed if we weren't in the upper range of that, because obviously, when you look at the components of load here from a financial perspective, it's not having much impact on our plans. And though by the way, we adjust all the time, for weather, for all kinds of things. And we have a big opportunity to do that.And I think there's a real opportunity for us to continue to advance, particularly with the renewables play and everything else that's going on. So, even without that though, I think we're in great shape. So it hasn't changed anything. I mean, probably last quarter we probably talked almost too much about the loans and the industrial side of things. And really there's nothing compared to what we experienced back in 2009 and that did pretty well weather in that storm.So -- but in this case, I think you\u2019re seeing some resiliency there from an industrial and manufacturing standpoint and you\u2019re seeing it start to pick up. And from the -- and as we said, it's also interesting to note, it's great to have diversity in load, because we've got the oil and gas activity that's going gangbusters with the transportation sector.And then also you think of what's going on just the consumer side and everyone's talking about this being a consumer-driven economy. And there's no question that people have more money in their pockets and more people have jobs. And you're seeing that reflected in the numbers that we see. So we stand committed to what we've always said before, and we fully expect to be in the upper range of that 5% to 7%. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Thanks for the clarity there. And then perhaps if I can jump in real quickly. How are you trending on energy supply as you think about the -- and you said, you might be updating this with respect to EEI, but can you elaborate at least initially on how you're trending on the energy supply side of the business? Obviously, there's a number of different moving factors within that segment of the business renewables increasing sort of legacy stuff declining still. How is that trending all together? If you can give us a little bit of a sense here, especially again relative to that longer-term 5% to 7%. Nick Akins : Yes. It's going to be up versus what we talked about last year at EEI. But the fact of the matter is, as we've sold off some of the competitive generation of the retiring plants, we're replacing some of those earnings with the renewable business that we had. So it's not declining the way you might expect from the sale of the competitive assets and the retirements, but we\u2019ve filled in some of that gap with the renewables, but we don't expect that to be a huge growing business for us going forward. Brian Tierney : And by the way on the contract -- contracted renewables, we continue to do very well in that business. Obviously, it's measured with a $2.2 billion of capital that we've allocated to it. The organization there is doing a wonderful job of being judicious about that. Obviously, the acquisition that we made was very positive, but the development opportunities are significant there. And we have some other opportunities that we continue to work on.So that pipeline can continue as long as we wanted to continue. And to what extent we want to continue. But we're able to make that kind of decision regarding that business, because we also have a huge transmission business and a growing distribution business is huge already, but there's all kinds of opportunities there. So really our big issue is continuing to manage around a strong and robust balance sheet continuing to deploy the capital. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Great. I'll leave it there. See you guys soon. Cheers. Brian Tierney : Thanks. Operator : Next we\u2019ll go to line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Nick Akins : Good morning Steve. Steve Fleishman : Hey, good morning. I\u2019m just the first curious question on the growth at the PSO particularly on energy because from an energy standpoint you would have thought that's been the area where the rig count has gone down the most. So is there a way to kind of make sense of that? Nick Akins : Well, there has been some industrials that have in place down there and some expansions. And so Oklahoma has a governor down there that is really focused on economic development and I think it's having an impact on the state.We're very happy to see that. There's certainly low rates there, and the ability to put these industrials in place, but it's probably a more balanced economy as well. Steve, even what you're seeing with rig count. A lot of the growth that we've seen has been a mid and downstream. And a lot of that specifically in pipeline transportation un-congesting a lot of the shale region congestion that's happened over the last several years and it's moving the products and commodities out of those regions. Steve Fleishman : Okay. That makes sense. Thanks. And just -- I think you kind of answered this, but just the renewables acquisition that you made. Can you just give us kind of a flavor of how well that's gone versus pro forma? And just how much are you seeing the ability to potentially expand. Nick Akins : Yeah, I think we're non-utility renewables. Yeah, so we're particularly pleased with the performance of that particular acquisition and really in concert with the other development opportunities that we were focused on. But when you think about the acquisition of not only the projects and really the economics was based on the active projects that were ongoing the developmental opportunities we\u2019ve hardly placed any value on, because you didn't know they would happen. But in fact those have continued to progress quite nicely.So it really has been an opportunity for us to continue the expansion of that effort. And then you also have to include Santa Rita in that where we\u2019ve continue to expand from that perspective. So I think that business is moving along quite well. We're very disciplined in the way we approach it and I think it's paid off. Steve Fleishman : Okay. Thank you. Nick Akins : Yeah. Operator : Our next question is from Christopher Turnure with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Nick Akins : Good morning. Christopher Turnure : Good morning, guys. My first question is just on forward-looking guidance. I guess, one, it sounds like you would not put out a 2021 range at EEI for EPS? And then, two, related to that, can you remind us of the current drivers underlying your 2020 range? Nick Akins : Yes. So, we're likely just to focus on 2020. At EEI we reaffirmed our 5% to 7% earnings growth rate. Remember that our guidance for 2020 is $4.25 to $4.45 and we're likely to say that that's what it will be again for 2020. And the key drivers are the things that you would think about for a traditional premium regulated utility.It's rate outcomes, ability to invest in our organic regulated businesses, our ability to continue to invest in contracted renewables, and then, of course, things like weather and load will impact the earnings outlook as well. So not to forget, of course, our ability to constrain as we have over many years O&M spending and we're particularly going to be focused on that in 2020. Brian Tierney : You're going to hear more about now achieving excellence program that really is focused on a forward view of where our business needs to go. And our employees are all energized around it, because we have to redefine ourselves going forward.And the outcome of that, obviously, is to be able to deploy more capital, but also to reduce O&M, because you're able to deploy capital and be able to optimize and drive efficiencies through automation digitization and all those kinds of things.And so, for us it's really a focus on changing that business. And the fact that we're coming out with our guidance for 2020 and then the 5% to 7% growth rate, I think, we're comfortable with just doing that because that element of consistency is there and we don't expect it to change. I mean you can sort of do your own math.And typically what we've done is, when we go down over the year we just did the math for you. So just think of it from that perspective. Now the one thing that could change that is the regulated renewables that are not included in the capital plan. So you could have a step change and then continue at 5% to 7%. So that's the kind of thing that we're looking at right now. Nick Akins : A positive step change. Brian Tierney : Yes, positive step change. Christopher Turnure : Okay. That's good to hear. So it sounds like some of the positive things over the past year that have changed underlying 2020 are potentially curtailed a little bit, maybe by load or other factors. But, net-net, you're pretty much come back to the same place? Nick Akins : No. We're not saying anything back in 2020, because obviously our transmission business continues to do well and other components of our business as well. And then the load itself. There's components of that load that\u2019s doing really well.And from a financial perspective, load will have not that much of an impact on the earnings of the company. So we're not saying that at all. I mean 2020, it's full speed ahead. And then 2021, we'll obviously see the outcome of the regulated renewable piece of it and go from there. Christopher Turnure : Okay. Excellent. And then, just given one of your peers in Texas and some of the back and forth in their rate case proceeding, can you give us an update on kind of the latest in the rate case process and dialogue and any thoughts to the overall Texas environment changing? Nick Akins : Well, certainly, Texas is Texas. I mean, there's all kinds of opinions and interveners obviously have their opinions. But when it comes down to it it's AEP Texas is a transmission and distribution utility. And it's very difficult to disallow costs that are spent from a transmission and a distribution perspective. So that's going to be up to the Texas Commission.And certainly, we have a different fact patterns than the other one that you referred to. And every case is different, every company is different, the kind of investments are different. So we feel good about our position in AEP Texas. That's why we continue to invest the way we do. So, obviously, we're looking for a positive outcome as a signal to continue investing. Christopher Turnure : Okay. Thanks, Nick. Nick Akins : Yes. Operator : Next we'll go to Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Nick Akins : Yes. Hi, Greg. Greg Gordon : Hey, how are you? Good morning. Great quarter. Congrats. Nick Akins : Thanks. Greg Gordon : What is the fascination down in Texas with the idea of ring fencing? I know that it's been proposed in both the -- one of your competitors' pending cases as well as staff positions proposing it in yours. And I'm just wondering what your perspective on that is and where you think they're coming from? Nick Akins : Yes. It's probably a better question for the commission than for us. But, obviously, during the Encore proceedings that's were sort of all this started. And obviously a company like Encore they wanted to make sure that there are some local type of control. And we're you operating in the state and have been for years.And I think the commission obviously is interested in how much control is placed within Texas around the assets that they feel like that benefit the state of Texas. So, I suspect you may see some reminiscence of that showing up in various cases, but we have been in and are operating in Texas for a long time and that's not going to change. Brian Tierney : Greg, the things that's ironic particularly given our situation in Texas is that we are a net investor in Texas. Meaning we're putting debt and equity capital to work in Texas rather than taking it out.So, for us I think they want to see us continue doing what we've been doing now for years which is investing that capital in Texas rather than taking it out and that's what we intend to continue to do. Nick Akins : Texas is one of the fastest-growing territories that we have. And we're not going to -- I mean we're not going to fall back on our ability to invest and produce benefits for our customers. And in East Texas obviously we have direct contact with the customers in the portion is at T&D and -- but certainly, I think that this line is getting more and more all the time and that's probably a feature that needs to be discussed in Texas about how to deal with that. But nevertheless that's down for the strategy part of it in the future. Gregory Gordon : Thank you. Then one more. I know it's early days, but what is the -- so has there been any public response from intervenor groups with regard to the North Central wind proposal? And do we see a more sort of accepting initial response than we did in your wind catcher proposal? Or is it too early to say? Nick Akins : I'd say it's too early to say. At this point, there's nothing public that's been out there. But I'll say that we purposely filed this to where it had a lot of variability, a lot of optionality to it, and certainly consistent with the ongoing existing processes of the integrated resource planning of each one of the areas.And I would say just back alone we've had more -- at least a more positive reception of how to deal with it. And so I would have to say things are going reasonably well at this point. And certainly the parties involved know and understand it because after going through wind catcher this one, you can really talk about what the differences are and the beneficial differences.If they were concerned about transmission don't be concerned about it. If you are concerned about a large area just one area you don't concerned about that either. And if you're concerned about dependency on one area versus no don't worry about that either.So, I think our processes and with the procedural schedules already defined in every jurisdiction, we're rolling along to a summer of getting the approvals and moving ahead. Gregory Gordon : Fantastic. Thank you, guys. Nick Akins : Thanks Greg. Operator : And next the line of with Greg [Indiscernible] with UBS. Please go ahead. Nick Akins : Good morning. Unidentified Analyst : Yes, thank you. Good morning. I was wondering if it's possible to get a preview of the CapEx update at EEI maybe just -- maybe the drivers and I assume the backlog would increase. Nick Akins : So, I really want to see the detail after EEI. But if you looked at the trends for how we've been spending dollars over the last decade or so, the preponderance of it going to all regulated properties and the preponderance of that going to the wire side of the business. So, that trend that you've seen in the past is going to continue in the detail that we're going to release it yet. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. Thank you. Look forward. Nick Akins : Good. Thanks. Operator : Next move to Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Nick Akins : Hey Michael. Michael Lapides : Good morning guys. Congrats on a good quarter. Nick Akins : You got a big game coming up. Michael Lapides : We got to get a quarter back healthy before we play out -- scare the heck out again. A couple of things. One interest rates, obviously, are way down especially the long end of the curve. Just curious how you're thinking about what this means for not just pension expenses that flow through the income statement, but also pension contributions. Nick Akins : So, that's a good question. We plan every year as we go into the year to pay to contribute to the pensions about equal to our annual service cost. For the last two years, both 2019 and 2018, we sort of had a funding holiday and the decrease in interest rates has pushed down our funding a little bit really into the mid-90s for pensions and still very well over OPEB, but rates can only go down so much more I think. And so, I think we don't have much downside on the pension fund.Again, we'll be watching every year what our funding is going to be for next year. We plan on putting in about $100 million for service -- annual service costs, and we still expect the expense side of that equation to be about zero to maybe a slight positive credit. Brian Tierney : That's a good thing about being well-funded on our pension and OPEB, that gives us a lot of flexibility and there's really no surprises. Michael Lapides : Got it. And then one follow-up. When you think about the docking, especially obviously PSO and the different SWEPCO stage for the North Central Wind's process, how do you think this is different than what you went through with Wind Catcher? Nick Akins : I think Wind Catcher was a unique situation. I mean we obviously looked at it and thought that there's a great opportunity for all of these jurisdictions. But, at the end of the day, there was a large project and one area with a large generation or connect transmission, whatever you want to call it. And you got hanging up on the risk associated with that, particularly with all the customer savings and trying to figure that out and making sure that everyone was comfortable with that kind of project.I still stand by it. It was a great project. There's no question about it. But we learned from that. And I think the more you stick with the regulatory processes that the commissions have had longstanding. I mean we've had other renewable projects that we've done the same exact process with that have gone through in their problem.We want to refashion this thing to make sure it is what everybody expected to see. And when you look at these projects, there's three different wind farms that are involved with that with a lot flexibility on new-in and news-out. And it gives us the ability to not only do that, but also not depend upon additional transmission, so you don't have to focus on that piece of it.And then also for us to be able to look at the project benefits themselves, those benefits are still substantial. So, I would say that -- and of course, the way it worked out in the bidding itself -- I can't talk about this, but we chose those three projects because they were much better than the others that were bid from a pricing perspective, but also all three of them happen to be with a party that we have continually done business with on a regular basis.So, we're very comfortable with the deliverability of that -- of those projects. And, we feel confident that the savings that we've presented in the various commission followings are secured, and we're very happy about that.And then also, part we got hang up a little bit on our own natural gas forecast versus standard natural gas forecast out there. So, even though we thought our forecast was a good one, we decided okay, we're going to just use those standard forecasts for the evaluation, so they buy new that it was coming from an independent party and we wouldn't get into the conversation of your forecast is showing more benefits than another standard forecast. So, we did it from that perspective as well.I think the other big difference too. We did have a lot of outreach to the individual staff and so forth at the various commission levels with Wind Catcher to try to explain what it was about. Well, it's sort of a natural progression for us to be able to move to the outreach programs that we have, because we've already had substantial discussions of the benefits of wind power in general.Now, it's a matter of okay, this is what the RFP process is. This is what the wind power that's available, the attractiveness of the wind power and we're going through the regular process to do it. And that communication has been positive, and we've also communicated with other parties in the process too to let them know what's going on. So, I would say that all-in-all, it's been much better and probably a much more pleasant experience than before. Michael Lapides : Got it. Thank you, Nick. And one last thing. Tax rates, how should we think about what the consolidated tax rate for income statement reporting purposes is going to be in 2019 liquidity assuming guidance? Brian Tierney : So, for GAAP taxes, we're anticipating about a 2.6% to 3% effective tax rate for the year, obviously driven down by the amortization of the deferred protected and unprotected taxes. But for 2019, there's also an AMT credit carryforward from prior periods. So that 2.6% to 3% is going to be lower than what we anticipate going forward where we anticipate a rate after the amortization of the deferred taxes to be about 10% going forward. Michael Lapides : Meaning, if I think about 2020 tax rate and 2021, you're using about 10% for guidance for those years. Brian Tierney : We are, but -- and let me be clear about that. That's what we're using for guidance. That's what's in our numbers. That's what we figure to be around at 10%. If we were to have incremental income because we're maxing to the 75% allowed for the upper taxes. If we -- I'm sorry for the production tax credits. If you were to have incremental income and you're trying to model that in, you should use a 24% rate. Does that make sense? Michael Lapides : I think so, but I can follow-up offline guys. Brian Tierney : So let me just try to be clear. What's in our $4.25 to $4.45 guidance for 2020 assumes an effective tax rate of about 10%. If you were to layer in incremental, you need to use a 24% rate. Michael Lapides : Got it. Understood. So the -- it have to be a lot of incremental to move the needle on the weighted average. Brian Tierney : Yes sir. Michael Lapides : Cool. Thank you, Brian. Much appreciated guys. Brian Tierney : Thanks, Michael. Operator : Next we'll go to Angie Storozynski with Macquarie. Please go ahead. Brian Tierney : Good morning, Angie. Angie Storozynski : Good morning. Very few questions. Just going back to the oil and gas related sales. So you mentioned pipeline investments, but we're actually hearing that drillers are switching pump from diesel to electric and that could be a meaningful driver of sales growth of electric companies, but the companies are in our shale regions. Are you seeing this? Nick Akins : That's been going on for a while actually the conversion to electric. And then also when you look at the transportation fees there's a lot of activity around ability to get out of the shale gas fields and the gas out of the shale gas field. So there's not a lot of optimization on the transmission side. Brian? Brian Tierney : Yeah, it's a lot of -- rather than just on the pumping side and pipeline transportation, we're seeing a lot of electric compression. Angie Storozynski : Okay. And then to that point, you're showing us that the sensitivity of earnings, the changes in industrial sales is actually very low. So O&M the plan that you gave some efficiencies on the O&M side that you point on there about the EEI that would be actually a more meaningful earnings driver. Is that fair? Brian Tierney : Yeah. I think the other key areas we look at is if we need to deploy capital and reduce O&M because if you think about load in general, I think this is for many utilities but load in general, you can't have the expectation of ever increasing energy demand. You got to really think about efficiency what it means and what it means to the economy.And also if you assume that then the way that you continue to grow from a 5% to 7%, which we've confirmed is not only to deploy capital, but to reduce O&M. So it's a huge -- and that's why we say bending the O&M curve or doing those activities. It's going to be a key component in the future, I would say not for us -- but not just for us but for just about every utility. Angie Storozynski : Okay. And lastly so I understand that the rate based renewables are not currently embedded in either your CapEx plan or funding needs. I mean, assuming that mid of next year you get a green light at least on a portion of this incremental CapEx, you probably have incremental equity needs to fund this spending, would you consider some, sort of, an optimization of your current portfolio as a way to pay for the CapEx? Brian Tierney : Yes, we would and I think one of the big processes we have going forward will be around optimization of our balance sheet and capital rotation and capital management and asset management goes with that. Obviously it would be a great opportunity to get the wind power resources and we'll be looking at all kinds of methods to be able to fund that investment. Angie Storozynski : Very good. Thank you. Brian Tierney : Thank you. Darcy Reese : Hey John, we have time for one more call. Operator : And that will be from Ali Agha with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please go ahead. Ali Agha : Good morning. Brian Tierney : Good morning. Ali Agha : First question, Brian or Nick, I just wanted to understand the philosophy behind the annual dividend changes. As you mentioned last year, you moved it up 8%. And I believe that was to get you to the midpoint of your payout ratio. This year it\u2019s 4.5%, perhaps being a little below that midpoint, so just thinking the lumpiness there. How should we think about the philosophy behind that? Brian Tierney : Yeah. We're trying to keep it right in the middle of the payout range and that's what we do. This year -- you put last year and this year together, it's above the midpoint of our long-term growth rate for earnings. And I think the Board is trying to reward investors by keeping it right in the midpoint of that 60% to 70% stated payout ratio. Nick Akins : It's just unfortunate that we have quarters and years around the annual calendar and stuff like that. But lot of times you're looking at these the dividend side of things and of course it's going to move generally in that 5% to 7%. And it's been no secret that's tagged around the 6% range. And we are committed to stay firmly in the middle of that 60% to 70% payout range.But there's a lot of things to consider. I mean, we got the same questions, when we did 8.1% last year. What does that mean?So we're reiterating that, it will be in line with our 5% to 7% growth rate. But year-to-year you see just things that kind of round off on pennies and that kind of thing. But there should not be any interpretation that our Board feel differently about the prospects of growth of this company in the future.And so, we debated that quite a bit, because we did want to reaffirm this 5% to 7% growth rate. So, don't read anything into it. Ali Agha : Got you and then, last question, with regards to the 2020 range, 4 25 to 4.45. I mean that was provides with a long-time back. I think, EEI, if I recall it, lots has happened and got some very good rate case outcomes in Oklahoma, et cetera.So any thought on that, I mean I expect 2019 is turning out that maybe you could move that up or maybe the upper half or upper end more comfortable, as we sit here today, any thoughts around that? Brian Tierney : We're just -- we're going to refresh at EEI, Ali. But Nick always says we'd be disappointed if we weren't in the upper end of the range. And I think that's going to be true, for 2019 and 2020. Nick Akins : And probably some of these things just sort of have to prove themselves out over time. And we went to 5% to 7% after we sold the unregulated generation we were at 4% to 6% at that point, because we felt like that 5% to 7% was something that we saw going forward for the long-term.It is a long-term growth rate. So, we'll have to see. Obviously, we're seeing some positive outcomes. And we continue to see that. The question is okay, how sustainable is that on a long-term basis going forward, based on what we see today.And we're comfortable with the 5% to 7%. We're getting more comfortable with the upper ranges of 5% to 7%. But, before you change to 6% to 8% or are you asking if I can, you have to be able to credibly see that for the long-term. And that\u2019s something you have to sort of warm over to overtime. Ali Agha : I understood. Thank you. Nick Akins : Yeah. Darcy Reese : Thank you for joining us on today's call. As always the IR team will be available to answer any additional questions you may have. John, would you please give the replay information. Operator : Certainly, ladies and gentlemen, the replay starts today at 11 :15 a.m. Eastern and will last until October 31 at midnight.

At this point, all participant lines are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.I'd now like to turn the call now over to host Darcy Reese. Please go ahead. Darcy Reese : Thank you, Stephanie. Good morning, everyone and welcome to the fourth quarter 2019 earnings call for American Electric Power. Thank you for taking the time today to join us. Our earnings release, presentation slides and related financial information are available on our website at aep.com.Today we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors. Our presentation also includes references to non-GAAP financial information. Please refer to the reconciliation of the applicable GAAP measures provided in the appendix of today's presentation.Joining me this morning for opening remarks are Nick Akins, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Tierney, our Chief Financial Officer. We will take your questions following their remarks.I will now turn the call over to Nick. Nick Akins : Okay. Thanks, Darcy. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today for AEPs fourth quarter 2019 earnings call. I'll certainly spend some time reporting on the final quarter of the year and how the year has concluded, but there is no question AEP has hit the ground running in 2020. I know I live in Columbus, Ohio and I do root for the Buckeyes if they're not playing LSU, but I have to use an LSU analogy given their victory in the college football national championship.The way in which the LSU office executed during the season is the way I feel about our AEP team, whether it's our emphasis on customer experience, regulatory activity, major projects and initiatives, contracted and regulated to renewables, capital allocation, O&M optimization, and our focus on culture, innovation and operational excellence. These are just a few of the plays in the playbook that continue to be executed flawlessly with talent that our team possesses. The results of 2019 indicate that and the success so far in 2020 of major initiatives that I'll cover today indicate that as well.But first, let's discuss 2019, 2019 was a great year for the company. We delivered operating earnings of $0.60 per share for the quarter, bringing our operating earnings for 2019 to $4.24 per share, which was at the top end of our revised guidance range of $4.14 to $4.24 per share. As we showed at the last EEI Financial Conference, AEP has a habit of hitting the upper half of the guidance range, if not exceeding it, and this year has been no exception. As we have said repeatedly, we would be disappointed in not achieving the same track record in the future.Brian will cover GAAP and operating earnings later in today's presentation. Additionally, for 2019, we had an average regulated ROE of 9.7% for the year and increased the dividends as well during fourth quarter 2019. It was also another year of rate case activity with the completion of cases in West Virginia, Oklahoma, and Arkansas and additional filings made in Indiana, Michigan and Texas. We also filed for regulatory approvals at the PSO and SWEPCO jurisdictions of Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana and Texas for North Central Wind, a 1,485 megawatt wind investment all of which I will update later.And during 2019 we acquired the Central Wind portal, which in addition to our other contractor renewals portfolio has delivered beyond our expectations. Lastly, as we promised during last year's EEI Financial Conference, we are focusing on bending the O&M curve with an eye toward the future. Late last year, we kicked off our achieving excellence program to not only further optimize O&M, but set the tone for a sustainable and lasting culture change that constantly demands a forward looking view of efficiency gains, the process and technology reviews.Brian will get into details of load growth, but I'll frame the discussion by saying that although low decrease in the fourth quarter compared to the previous year, we've seen consistent improvement in our commercial class of customers through 2019 mainly in education and healthcare, and while industrial growth is slowed, we still anticipate further additions and industrial load during 2020. So we are still projecting an increase in load for 2020. We have several areas of focus for 2020, first of all delivering operating earnings within the guidance range of for $4.25 to $4.45 per share with a midpoint of $4.35 per share.We will continue to focus on disciplined capital allocation investing 6.3 billion in CapEx substantially in our regulated wires businesses. We are pleased with the progress of our contracted renewables and fully expect that part of our business to continue to grow as well, because of very positive focus on fully utilizing our balance sheet for growth and dividends, you can expect a more refined approach to capital allocation rotation as we further develop opportunities for earnings growth associated with the capital we deploy.We expect to continue to develop 5% to 7% operating earnings growth and again, we would expect a step change of the base for earnings growth after North Central comes into play and continue with a 5% to 7% growth trajectory beyond that. We anticipate more granularity on that by the time we reach November EER. Additionally, as we said before, we will be disappointed if we are not in the upper half of that growth rate. Additionally, we will be finalizing base rate cases in Indiana, Michigan and Texas with constructive results that I will describe in a minute and we'll be initiating rate cases in Ohio, Louisiana and most likely Kentucky as well.First the cases with settlements, in Michigan, I&M filed the unanimous settlement in early January of 2020 with a net revenue requirement of 30 million, authorized ROE of 9.86% and effective date of February 1, 2020. Adjustments for wholesale load loss were approved, so overall a good settlement there was approved by the Michigan Commission in January. During fourth quarter the Arkansas base case was completed with a unanimous settlement fall in October and approved by the Arkansas Public Service Commission in December 2019 and included an 18 million net increase and 9.45% ROE with a cap structure of 52.1, 47.9 debt to equity with a formula rate plan process for five years.Regarding Texas, on February 13 of this year, AEP Texas filed a settlement that included a 40 million revenue requirement reduction with a 9.4% ROE and a cap structure of 57.5 debt, 42.5 equity along with other disallowance and refunds associated capital disallowances in tax reform. The settlement also includes deferral of capitalized vegetation management into a regulatory asset collected over five years and our commitment to follow another base case within four years and left to the PUCT to decide the ring fencing issue. It appears the commission dealt with the ring fencing issue in a positive way in the center point case, so hopefully will be treated favorably as well. We anticipate the PUCT will take up the case at the February 27 open meeting.In the Indiana base case, a hearing was held in October, we continue to wait an order and still expect the order to be effective in March of 2020. Regarding the other cases in Ohio, Louisiana, Virginia, SWEPCO Louisiana initiated base rate proceeding previously ordered by the LPSC to echo plans to supplement this filing with the cost of service study and additional testimony during 2020 after the present 2017 formula rate plan is completed. In Ohio We will file our next distribution rate case by June 2020. We do not expect this case to be unusual in any regard and most likely will request a fairly low increase in rates. We'll also review the distribution investment rider as part of this case, so more to come later in 2020 on this case.In an APCo Virginia, we are required to file in March and will show that we are in below the bottom of the earnings range for the 2017, 2019 tri-annual period. In December 2019, we impaired 93 million before tax related to the early retirement of three coal units as allowed under Virginia law. This enables us to file for a rate increase and we would expect new rates to be effective in February 2021.Now, on to the North Central Wind project, we continue to make positive progress on this 1,485 megawatt wind project that would benefit PSO and SWEPCO customers. In December 2019, we filed a settlement agreement in Oklahoma for 675 megawatts. In late January of this year, we filed a settlement agreement with parties in Arkansas for 171 megawatts. Together, if approved by the Oklahoma and Arkansas commission that represents about 1.1 billion of incremental capital opportunity and meets the threshold to move forward with a project regardless of Louisiana, Texas outcomes. To move forward with the entire project representing 2 billion of incremental investment would require Louisiana and Texas to approve their portions or for the other jurisdictions to take advantage of the flex up options in another jurisdiction if another jurisdiction does not move forward.While the Oklahoma settlement does not include the flex up option, the Arkansas settlement does recommend this option. So for example, if Louisiana were to flex up, Texas would no longer be required, however, I would say we welcome settlement discussions in both Louisiana and Texas and remain hopeful that these jurisdictions will also recognize the value that these investments will deliver to customers. First up to bat for approvals is Oklahoma, which is \u2013 it's on the signing agenda actually for today, and Arkansas approvals are expected in May of this year, so great progress and we are optimistic about the future of North Central Wind.Of course regarding to financing as you might recall, the current 33 billion CapEx plan provided the EER, which goes through 2024 supports a five to 7% growth rate, and does not include North Central Wind, although the actual size and investment is still yet to be determined. And if you were to ask about a base case assumption, our current thinking is to finance the acquisition with somewhere between 50 to two thirds equity, we will time the raising of capital with the execution of the project, in the event of any asset sale or rotation we'll consider relevant proceeds as part of the financial decision. The CapEx associated with this project will be incremental to the current CapEx plan, and will result in a step change to base in which to measure our continued 5% to 7% growth rate. We are committed to our 5% to 7% growth rate and this will not change, but the addition of this project is expected to put us solidly in the upper half of the range.Now since we have talked about some of the growth related issues, let's discuss our achieving excellence program that will enable us to bend the O&M curve. Over the last decade, AEP has successfully been able to manage O&M relatively flat. We historically focused on identifying efficiencies implemented with a lean management system throughout the organization. A couple of years ago, we were put in touch with a company EHS Partners, actually through State Auto CEO at the time to specializes in engaging companies to focus on generation and enactment of cost savings ideas.They have also worked with other companies in our space and came highly recommended. We were not only looking for reviews of existing processes and activities, but also with an eye toward digitization, optimization and sustainability review in the future. The program is called the Achieving Excellence Program and it is an employee based O&M prioritization and optimization effort to drive down cost in 2020 and beyond. Going forward, we expect to find additional efficiencies with the program through data analytics, automation, digital tools, use of drones, outsourcing workforce planning, strategic sourcing and others.We started the intensive process last year, and are currently in the process of validating thousands of ideas and are presently targeting approximately 1,000 for validation and execution. Some have already started in order to leverage into 2020. Examples of ideas include various use of telematics to optimize crew routing and utilization, robotic process automation for labor intensive processes, like some aspects of accounting and various uses for drones for ball our distribution inspections and so forth. This process is kicking into gear and it will become part of our budgeting process each year and ultimately embedded into our culture of innovation, more to come on that later in the year.We are no doubt in a transformational time in our industry. Our resources are changing dramatically and we intend on moving toward a clean energy future as quickly as possible, from the North Central project to the recent announcements to the Flat Ridge 3 wind project in Kansas, this being sold to Evergy \u2013 outputs being sold to energy and to our South Bend solar installation that we partnered with Notre Dame on. The IURC, the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission just approved that yesterday. And with Google, Facebook and Amazon resources are indeed changing. In fact, by the end of 2020, we will have retired over 10,000 megawatts of generation and make way for the resources of the future.This process will continue for AEP and certainly represents another great opportunity to invest capital for the betterment of the customer experience, to improve reliability and resiliency of the grid and to continue to improve our carbon emissions. This process will continue in working with our commissions and other stakeholders and through the development of our integrated resource plans. So when you think about the opportunities for generation, transformation, investment in transmission, the renaissance of distribution, distributed resources and your application of transportation to other areas, you can't help, but be bullish about the future of this industry in particular AEP with check marks in every category.So now I'll move to the equalizer graph and talk about some of the individual jurisdictions. So overall, we have regulated operations ROE of 9.7%. We generally project the ROE for our regulated segments to be combined in the 9.5% to 10% range. Note that AEP transmission hold goes now probably our second largest company based on average equity after APCo with AEP Ohio, I&M, SWEPCO and AEP Texas all roughly comparable sizes to each other. And certainly if PSO approves the North Central project they'll pick up as well. So we have \u2013 we're actually pretty well off with subsidiaries that are roughly about the same size with a lot of diversity.AEP Ohio, the ROE at the end of the fourth quarter was 12.3%. It's 9.6% adjusted for the legacy items and his legacy items are still the legacy fueling and capacity carrying charges that will be rolling off probably during this year. So we'll start tapering off to the roughly around 10% ROE as those areas roll off. APCo at the end of the fourth quarter 2019 was 9.2%, is below authorized due to lower normalized usage, increased other taxes and higher depreciation from increased capital investments partially offset by favorable weather. West Virginia implemented new base rates in March of 2019, including 44 million base rate increased based at 9.75% ROE and as I mentioned earlier before the Virginia tri-annual review is in 2020 and will cover those periods as well.As far as Kentucky is concerned the ROE for Kentucky at the end of fourth quarter was 7.4%, it's below authorized due to loss of load from weak economic conditions and loss of major customers along with higher expenses. Transmission revenues were also lower due to the delay of some capital projects. I&M at the end of fourth quarter was 11%. ROE was above authorized due to favorable weather, timing of expenses and onetime adjustments. I&M expects ROEs to be in the authorized range going forward with the continued successful execution of capital programs and generation transmission distribution and the recent future test year cases in Indiana, Michigan.PSO at the end of fourth quarter was 10.7%. PSOs ROE was above authorized mainly due to favorable onetime true-ups and weather. PSO received an order in space case settlement effective April 2019, proving a 46 million increase and transmission tracker ROE of 9.4%, the cap structure of 51.86% debt, 48.14% equity. The ROE for SWEPCO at the end of the fourth quarter was 6.8%. That was below authorized due to loss of load, mainly the wholesale load and continued impact of the Arkansas share of the Turk plant that is not in retail rates. This and certainly, as we said before Turk \u2013 that portion of Turk impacts the ROE by about 125 basis points. SWEPCO received an order in Arkansas bass case settled as I mentioned before, so we expect an uptick in its going forward.AEP Texas, fourth quarter was 7.7% and as you know, as I just mentioned, the AEP Texas rate case was going on, expecting an output of that pretty soon and then also the TCOS and DCRF filings that we usually file annually aren't made during the annual period of the rate case, so there's a lag associated with that. And while earning should improve in 2020 after we can resume these annual filings, continued high levels of investment will continue to impact the ROE as well. So investing heavily there, the annual trackers are particularly important and it'll be great to resurrect those and keep them going after the outcome of the rate case.AEP Transmission Holdco, the ROE for AEP Transmission is 11.5% and is driven by high revenues due to differences between actual and forecasted revenues as well as a favorable true-up and we expect Transmission's forecasting to be in the mid 10% range in 2020. So with that said, we're still making progress from that perspective. And the ones that they're lower we have rape cases that are planned and we have a stay off provision in Kentucky, so until June where we'll most likely file in a case there as well, so all of them should be moving in the right direction.So lastly, as many of you know, I'm a lifelong drummer and out of respect for Neil Peart of Rush, one of the greatest drummers of all time, as well as a lyricist and novelist he passed away in January. I leave you with this thought before turning it over to Brian. In his novel Clockwork Angels and the song titled, the garden, he wrote, the measure of a life is a measure of love and respect. So hard earned so easily burned in the fullness of time a garden to nurture and protect. This is true in life and is also true for companies like AEP.We strive for our investors and other stakeholders to love what we're doing and respect the work that we do through operational excellence, financial discipline and innovation. The track record of consistent earnings and dividend quality and the focus on our communities and customers is central to our continued mission of being the premium regulated utility. And once again last year in 2019, we continued that progress, now on to 2020. Rock on, Brian Brian Tierney : So thank you, Nick, I'll ask the participants to listen carefully because it's a little bit subtle. This is in fact me rocking on. So good morning, everyone, I'll take us through the fourth quarter and full year financial results, focusing primarily on year-to-date, provide some insight on load and the economy, review our balance sheet and liquidity and finish with a review of our outlook for 2020.Let's start briefly on Slide 6, which shows the comparison of GAAP operating earnings for the quarter and year-to-date periods. GAAP earnings for the fourth quarter were $0.31 per share, compared to $0.74 in 2018. GAAP earnings for the year were $3.89 per share, compared to $3.90 per share in 2018. There was a reconciliation of GAAP operating earnings in the appendix.We have consistently provided value for our shareholders outperforming the S&P 500 Electric Utilities Index in total shareholder return this year, and both the S&P 500 and Electric Utilities Index over the three and five year periods respectively.Let's turn to Slide 5, in the fourth quarter operating earnings were $0.60 per share or $294 million compared to $0.72 per share or $354 million in 2018. The detail by segment is shown in the boxes on the chart. But the change in our regulated businesses was driven by higher planned O&M and depreciation more than offsetting the return on incremental investment.Generation & Marketing was down $0.07 from last year, primarily driven by the expected timing of taxes. This segment reflects the growth in the renewables business and favorable retail margins, which offset lower capacity and energy margins in the generation business.Corporate and Other was up $0.02, primarily due to lower income taxes from the expected timing of consolidated tax adjustments, partially offset by higher state taxes.Let's turn to Slide 8, and review our full year results. Annual operating earnings for 2019 were $4.24 per share or $2.1 billion, compared to $3.95 per share or $1.9 billion in 2018.Looking at the drivers by segment, operating earnings for the Vertically Integrated Utilities were $2.17 per share, up $0.17, with successful implementation of rate changes being the largest driver. Other positive items included lower O&M and taxes as well as higher AFUDC. While weather was favorable compared to normal, it was unfavorable compared to 2018 subtracting $0.16. Normalized load was also down for the year and depreciation increased as well.Transmission and Distribution Utilities segment earned $1 per share down %0.05 from last year. Earnings in this segment declined due to the roll off of legacy riders in Ohio, lower normalized retail margins and higher O&M, depreciation and property taxes. These items were partially offset by the recovery of increased transmission that's in ERCOT, higher rate changes, the reversal of a regulatory provision in Ohio, favorable carrying charges in Texas and lower income taxes.The AEP Transmission Holdco segment continues to grow, contributing $1.05 per share, making this the second largest segment for operating earnings. The improvement in earnings of $0.30 over 2018 reflected a return on incremental rates base, the non-recurring prior year accounting adjustments, the favorable annual true-up and FERC settlement as well as higher as AFUDC. Net plant increased by $1.5 billion, or 18% since December of 2018.Generation & Marketing produced $0.30 per share. The renewables business grew with the repowering of Trent Mesa and Desert Sky, as well as the acquisition of multiple renewable assets. Increases and retail margins were offset by lower generation sales due to lower energy prices, retirement of plants and outages.Finally, Corporate and Other was down $0.14, driven by higher tax expense, primarily from state taxes and a prior period tax adjustment. Interest expense was also higher. For 2019, we are pleased with our results as we landed in the upper end of our increased earnings guidance range.Now, let's turn to Slide 9, to provide an update on our system load, starting in the lower right chart, normalized retail sales declined by 1.5% in the fourth quarter, compared to 2018. The growth in commercial sales this quarter was more than offset by the decline in industrial and residential sales. For 2019, AEPs normalized retail sales were down eight tenths of a percent from the prior year. Sales were down across all customer classes and most operating companies in 2019.Moving counterclockwise; normalized commercial sales increased by 0.5% for the quarter. The results varied by operating companies, but were strongest in the Transmission and Distribution Utilities segment. The commercial sectors that experienced the fastest growth for the quarter were utilities, government support offices and accommodations. For the annual comparison, normalized commercial sales were down four tenths of a percent in 2018 not surprising the sector that saw the biggest decline in 2019 was traditional retail. By contrast, there's been consistent improvement over the past 12 months in commercial sales growth.Moving left; normalized residential sales decreased by nine tenths of a percent for the quarter. Residential sales were up in the West vertically integrated utilities, but lost momentum elsewhere. While personal income growth across AEPs footprint outpaced inflation for the quarter, it was unable to keep pace with incomes for the rest of the US. For the year, normalized residential sales were essentially flat compared to 2018. Customer counts increased by three tenths of a percent, while normalized usage decreased by four tenths of a percent.Finally, in the lower left chart, industrial sales decreased by 3.5% in the fourth quarter, which brought the annual comparison to 1.9% below 2018. For both periods, industrial sales were down across most operating companies. Looking forward to 2020, we are projecting normalized load growth of five tenths of a percent over 2019. The majority of this growth is expected to come from the industrial class, where a number of industrial expansions are expected to come online.Turning to Slide 10, I'll provide a brief update with respect to industrial sales growth by sector. This chart shows the distinction in growth between the oil and gas sectors and all other industrial sectors. Sales to oil and gas industries increased by 3.5% in the fourth quarter, and ended the year 4.4% higher than 2018. This was largely driven by the 17% growth in the pipeline transportation sector.Most of this growth was a result of a number of anticipated expansions that address congestion in the major shale regions in our service territory. There are additional oil and gas related expansions that should provide continued growth in 2020. Focusing your attention on the green bars, the non-oil and gas industrials were down 6.1% for the quarter and ended the year down 4.2%. For the AEP system chemicals manufacturing and transportation equipment manufacturing accounted for most of this impact.Now let's turn to Slide 11 and review the status of our regional economies. As shown in the left chart, GDP growth for AEP Service territory was 2.1% for the quarter, which is three tenths of a percent below the US. All of our service territories experienced GDP growth for the quarter, with Texas being the strongest. Moving to the right chart, employment growth for the AEP Service territory improved to eight tenths of a percent above 2018. While US growth moderated slightly in the fourth quarter. Throughout the AEPs footprint, nearly 20,000 jobs were added in the fourth quarter, with a third of those coming from the education and healthcare sector.Now let's turn to Slide 12 and review the company's capitalization and liquidity. Our debt to total capital ratio increased during the quarter to 59.8% from 58.7% as we borrowed to fund our investment program. Our FFO to debt ratio stood at 13.5% on a GAAP basis and 13.9% based on Moody's methodology, reflecting increased debt and the impact of the flow back of ADIT through customer rates. Importantly, this is consistent with the drivers embedded in our guidance provided at the November 2019 EEI Conference. Liquidity remains strong at $2.1 billion supported by our revolving credit facility.Our qualified pension funding increased approximately 3% to 97% and our OPEB funding increased approximately 22% to 145%. Positive equity returns combined with rising yields that decreased pension and OPEB liabilities resulted in improvements in both plans funded status. The OPEB funded status also benefited from legislation the President signed in December that repealed the Cadillac tax and health insurance fee.Let's try and wrap this up on Slide 13 and get to your questions. We begin 2020 with a solid track record. Our 2019 earnings were strong as we continued to invest capital in our businesses and earn a return on this investment. We successfully integrated new contracted renewables into our portfolio. For nine years now, we've maintained O&M discipline and kept spending net of assets in a tight range of between $2.8 and $3.1 billion. In addition, over time, we have grown our dividend with earnings and expect to be able to do so going forward. Our dividend payout ratio is solidly in our 60% to 70% targeted range.Looking ahead to 2020, we are reiterating our operating earnings guidance of $4.25 to $4.45 per share. We will finalize our pending rate cases and move forward with additional opportunities in the renewable space. We will continue our disciplined approach to allocating capital and are confident that there's significant runway in our capital programs to reaffirm our long term operating earnings growth rate of 5% to 7%.With that, I will turn the call over to the operator for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ali Agha with STRH. Please go ahead. Nick Akins : Good morning, Ali. Ali Agha : Good morning. Thank you. First question, I just wanted to confirm that the 5% to 7% growth rate is that still based off of the original midpoint of 2018. Brian Tierney : Yes, yes, it is. Yeah. Ali Agha : Okay. And then in the past I know, Nick and Brian, you've talked about \u2013 when you don't want the 5 to 7, you've talked about hitting the high end of the range. I think today I heard you say upper half. So just wanted to be clear, is the is the aspiration upper half or is it the high end which I've heard you say in the past as well? Nick Akins : Yeah. So we say the upper half as far as a generalization, obviously, and as we go forward there's no question. I mean, we'll be disappointed with \u2013 it's pretty much the same thing to us. Ali Agha : Okay, and then, Nick, can you give us your latest thoughts on Kentucky Power and where that fits in the portfolio? Might that be a source of funding for North Central Wind, just how are you thinking about it currently? Nick Akins : Well, certainly, we're in a position now to where we can \u2013 we have uses for \u2013 certainly for capital to invest, we're able to look at our entire portfolio and determine, okay, is there is there an opportunity for rotations? Is there an opportunity for sale of assets, those types of things? But certainly, Kentucky remains a part of our portfolio. Obviously, as we look at any future positive investment we're making, I think it's probably safe to say \u2013 and you probably see from the FFO, debt and other credit metrics that they were fully utilizing our balance sheet. So we're moving into a stage where we have to think about optimization from a ROE standpoint for investors and that forces us to look at sources and uses. So no, I'm not commenting on Kentucky in particular, I think it's important to say that now we're a fully regulated utility. We can look at investments across the board and see what the best approach is. And I think that's what we're certainly alluding to as you go through this process. And really with North Central by the time the investment is needed, we have time to go through that process. Ali Agha : I got you, last question Brian then, looking at your 2020 load growth projections. What's causing residential to fall off more significantly in '20 versus the trend we saw in '19? Brian Tierney : It's just a normal business cycle. In that way we see residential and commercial generally follow industrial and now industrial is starting to come out of that and residential and commercial just haven't followed yet. It's really just a normal business cycle. Ali Agha : I got you, thank you. Nick Akins : Thank you, Ali. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrew Weisel with Scotiabank. Please go ahead. Nick Akins : Good morning Andrew. Andrew Weisel : Hey, good morning. My first question is on dividends. The 2020 increase was 4.5% as far as guidance that it's growing approximately in line with the EPS growth at a high end really at about 7% range. So can you just remind us what the latest thinking is on what to expect going forward and if 6% would be a good bogey? Nick Akins : Yeah, it's unchanged. We fully expect our dividend growth to be commensurate with earnings growth. And as you know, we've talked about this \u2013 the 4.5% this year and then the previous year is 8.2% or something like that. So it averages out to 6%. We focus on nominally the 6%. So you can expect that in the future. Andrew Weisel : Okay, great, just wanted to affirm that. The next question, forgive me if I missed it, but can you describe what you're expecting around FERC approved transmission ROEs for your subs and would you expect your PBM and SPP allowed ROEs to be within the range of reasonableness? Nick Akins : Yeah, so obviously, we have that case in the northeast that has brought up at least some issues and certainly that's been evaluated, a lot of parties have filed to review that outcome of the MISO case and that was really the one that I think sort of send a message. Previously the Northeast there is a mechanism for four different measures and they went to two different measures, with MISO and I think it may be had some unintended consequences hopefully, but certainly the industry has responded, AEP has responded as far as Transource. We have settlements in our \u2013 in the east and the west. And in the East, we have a stay out provision, in the west we do not. So they're \u2013 but it wouldn't make any sense for filings to occur while the FERC is continuing to review the outcome of the MISO rehearing that's occurring. Yeah, so the stay out was in SPP. So just make sure of that, but nevertheless, right now, though, our rates, we view them as consistent with that realm of reasonableness. And we continue to see it that way. And I think, as we get through the rehearing at FERC, I think there's certainly an opportunity for us to ensure that that's the case going forward. Andrew Weisel : Any sense of when we might have better clarity on that. I know it's a tough process to predict everything if FERC is to predict in terms of timing. Nick Akins : Yeah, you have to ask that question. But I think that the \u2013 certainly, I think there's a necessity to get it resolved quickly because it's brought a lot of unintended risk into the investment in transmission. And I think it's important to get it rectified earlier. And as you might recall, before they start looking at actually our path project as a proxy for evaluation of when ongoing view should look like and we view that as promising and certainly, they have reacted reasonably quickly from that perspective and I think they've recognized that the market is truly watching in terms of what FERC's philosophy is relative to transmission investment, which I believe is unchanged. And actually, I think, at least what I've heard from the commissioners and public forums is that the transmission continues to be an investment that's required for optimization of the grid and historically they've incentivized that I fully expect them to continue to do that. Andrew Weisel : Great, that's very helpful. One last quick one, I know the Texas rate case settlement doesn't directly impact the North Central Wind proposal, but did that come up at all in your discussions? Did the interveners give any indication about how they're thinking about it? Nick Akins : No, I think they're being dealt with completely separately. AEP Texas is the case that is a base case and then actually the wind project is in the SWEPCO jurisdiction associated with Texas. So it's still integrated, regulated in that part of Texas. And they're used to dealing with wind request. It's happened before. There's a lot of precedence for review of the wind projects. And certainly we were building upon what we learned from the previous wind catcher activity and found something that we felt like addressed the concerns during that period of time, but also dealt with it in a way that's consistent with the integrated resource planning processes. And something that's fairly innocuous in terms of review by the Commission. So we certainly \u2013 as I said earlier, I think Oklahoma and Arkansas are well on their way. Louisiana and Texas are certainly in the process and we would \u2013 certainly are hopeful that they'll continue to see the benefits of that project as well and get it done very quickly. Andrew Weisel : Right, no, I know there's separate jurisdictions just asked because I think there's a lot of overlapping interveners, but fair enough. I appreciate the comment. Thank you Nick Akins : No, there's not really. I mean, the interveners may \u2013 the interveners themselves, they may be the same, but the issues are very different. Andrew Weisel : Understood, thanks. Nick Akins : Yeah. Operator : Our next question comes from Praful Mehta with Citigroup. Please go ahead. Nick Akins : Good morning, Praful. Praful Mehta : Thanks so much. Hi, good morning, guys. Congrats on a good quarter and a good year. Nick Akins : Thanks. Praful Mehta : So just wanted to clarify again on the equity point and the credit point first, it was helpful to get the overall perspective on how you look at the portfolio and the credit clearly, at this point your balance sheet is being utilized well. So if North Central were to move forward, is the understanding that if there isn't any portfolio optimization opportunity that some equity would be issued at some point? Just want to clarify the timing of that and any further thoughts on that credit and equity point? Nick Akins : Yeah. So I'll turn it over to Brian in a second. But certainly, our view is that we sort of presented a base case of \u2013 without any rotation or any of those kinds of activities occurring we would expect equity be issued in that 50 to two thirds range. So I think that's at least the going in position and certainly we're saying the project is entirely 100% incremental to our existing capital forecast. So you would expect equity, but if there's any kind of capital rotation or sale of assets that mitigates the need for any portion or all of the equity, then certainly that'll be a part of the process. Brian? Brian Tierney : Yeah. The only additional color I'd add to that Praful is we think that we could time any equity needs consistently with when the projects for North Central Wind would come online, a small portion at the end of 2020 and a much more significant portion at the end of '21. Praful Mehta : Got it, okay. So the earnings and the dilution probably match that helps kind of with the earnings profile then? Nick Akins : That's right. We think we could time them very closely. Praful Mehta : Okay, perfect. And then just secondly, on the renewal opportunities, in which you highlight \u2013 is this more utility side renewables or is it more on the unregulated side or both, if you can just give a little bit more color and also, how big do you see the opportunity to be? Because clearly, everybody seems to be investing more on that side and there is a significant opportunity. So if you can scale that for us, that'll be helpful too? Nick Akins : Yeah, so it's on both sides, both sides of the ledger and obviously we still have integrated regulated jurisdictions and the one South Bend project in partnership with Notre Dame that's on the regulated Indiana, Michigan Power and then also there's projects that others have done in our regulated footprint and as well on the contracted side we continue to advance that around the country in various forms, but not just tied to wind power solar, but other projects as well. And we're sort of a unique I guess, from the contracted business. We cover about every quadrant of the business relationship that customers would expect in the \u2013 and really are on site partners our AEP Energy or AEP Retail, all those come together to really provide sort of all-in solution for customers.So we see the growth occurring on both sides. I think with \u2013 certainly north wind \u2013 North Central is an example, obviously, the way the integrated resource plans of various jurisdictions are moving forward. I know at APCo there's a solar requirement in Virginia and then there's other opportunities for us to do it on the regulated side, as well as the unregulated. And keep in mind, we are contracted business, we limited 10% of the business because of tax reasons. And so we want the regulated side to grow to enable our contracted business to grow as well. And this is a nice balance for us, and we'll continue doing that. And certainly, I would say it's moving very much in both directions. And if you look at post North Central and which now after the purchase of the Central Wind assets, we're probably, I mean, roughly half and half. So I think it's a great diverse solution. Praful Mehta : Got it, that's super helpful. Given the size of your footprint and as you've said, you have opportunities on both sides. Do you see that as helping you achieve that higher end or upper end of the seven or even getting beyond that? I'm just trying to again dimension how big the opportunity could be given you have it on really both sides given your footprint. Nick Akins : Yeah, I think that's why we said upper half because there's so many opportunities out there for us. And for our ability to continue to grow, certainly, we're going to have to continue to feed the beast in a way that continues that 5% to 7% growth trajectory. But as we said before, with all the projects that we know that are out there with the opportunities in front of us, and you can look at our integrated resource plan on the regulated side and see what's in front of us. And you can certainly see, I think there was a report recently of AEP and the trans \u2013 just the generation transformation alone, which drives the renewable piece of it, along with some natural gas. It's a real opportunity for AEP to continue to enhance that growth pattern, so really the fundamentals are there. It's a matter of execution. Praful Mehta : Got it, super helpful, guys. Thanks so much. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Sophie Karp with KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Nick Akins : Good morning, Sophie. Sophie Karp : Hi, good morning, guys. Brian Tierney : Good morning. Sophie Karp : Thank you for taking my question. So on North Central Wind, I guess, you've had pretty constructive settlements in a couple of jurisdictions by now, Texas being more or less the only one where you still engaged in an inactive regulatory process. I'm just curious at what point do you think you have a critical mass to officially call it a go input in the plan? Nick Akins : Yeah, we've got that. Once the \u2013 if we get approval from the Oklahoma Commission, maybe today, and then we get approval from Arkansas, we have the critical mass for the project to move forward. The question is at what scale? So with those two projects together, you're already at 846 megawatts of the 1,485 and it's already a 1.1 billion investment and if you move forward with Louisiana for example \u2013 and Arkansas remember has the flex up. So the flex up means it'll take the additional capacity, the wind power capacity, if it's not taken by another jurisdiction. So if Arkansas flexes up and then Louisiana approves with a flex up, then you got the 1,485 megawatts of the whole project. Now, obviously, if Texas sees its way to be a part of the project as well, which I believe they should then each of the states will participate in the full project. So right now I'd say, with Oklahoma and Arkansas, settlements are approved the project is moving forward, that's a given. Then the question becomes, okay, what scale? And that'll be determined by the other two jurisdictions and the amount of flex up that's enabled in those settlements. So I'd say you should be happy with the progress right now and I think \u2013 I also think you should be optimistic about this project being fully vetted and fully approved. Sophie Karp : Terrific, terrific, thank you for clarifying this and then as a follow up to the same kind of line of thinking, right, it seems like this playbook is working really better than maybe some of the prior projects you're looking at. Is that something that you can use over and over again, as you scale up your investments in renewables maybe on the regulated side? Nick Akins : Absolutely, I think there's a pattern here and that's why I talked so much about the generation transformation that's occurring. We already have \u2013 we're retiring generation, older generation. And that's coal and natural gas and certainly replacing with new resources that provide a real opportunity and that opportunity is really driven by reducing costs for consumers and this thing \u2013 the North Central is a perfect representation of it overall if the entire project, 2 billion in investment, but over 3 billion in savings to customers and that's one of the key areas for the utility in the future is to be able to deploy capital to reduce customers\u2019 bills and that's what we're doing and that's what many of these projects allow us to do. Sophie Karp : Thank you. I'll jump back into the queue. Nick Akins : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from [indiscernible]. Please go ahead, Nick Akins : Nice. Unidentified Analyst : Hey, Nick. Congratulations on LSU. Nick Akins : Yeah, put that in there for you. Unidentified Analyst : I wanted to \u2013 I had a clarification for you, just when you guys talk about your pro forma for a North Central Wind, is that putting it the high end of 5 to 7 or does it put a step up in earnings and then you grow off of that? Nick Akins : It'll be a step up. It'll be a step up. Step change when North Central gets in, but we'll continue with the 5% to 7%. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, all right, that's helpful. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. Operator : [Operator Instructions] No further questions at this time. Darcy Reese : Thank you for joining us on today's call.

I would now like to turn the conference over your first speaker, Ms Darcy Reese. Please go ahead. Darcy Reese : Thank you, Perky. Good morning everyone and welcome to the first quarter 2020 earnings call for American Electric Power. Thank you for taking the time today to join us. Our earnings release, presentation slides, and related financial information are available on our website at aep.com. Today we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors.  Our presentation also includes references to non-GAAP financial information. Please refer to the reconciliation of the applicable GAAP measures provided in the appendix of today\u2019s presentation. Joining me this morning for opening remarks are Nick Akins, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Brian Tierney, our Chief Financial Officer. We will take your questions following their remarks. I will now turn the call over to Nick. Nick Akins : Okay, thank you Darcy. Welcome and thank you all for joining AEP\u2019s first quarter 2020 earnings call. I want to take a moment to extend our sympathies to all those who have been personally impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. At AEP, we understand that we are all in this together.  The AEP Foundation has contributed to charities across our footprint to ensure that we are part of the solution for the customers and communities. In addition to providing our employees with the personal protective equipment they need to do their jobs, we have donated masks, gloves, and other essential items needed by hospitals across our service territory. To further assist those in need within our communities, our customer service representatives have provided assistance in fielding questions on how to secure small business loans. Throughout these challenging times, I continue to be extremely proud of our employees who have done an outstanding job demonstrating their capacity for being adaptable and exercising the agility needed to meet the challenges of a rapidly changing situation. As we continue to adapt to the ongoing challenges imposed by COVID-19, we remain committed to keeping our employees safe and keeping America powered through these unprecedented times. Certainly as we headed into March during the first quarter, the story for the quarter would have been one in which we have all heard before, mild weather impacted the first quarter, but as we\u2019ve also heard before, a quarter does not a year to make [ph] and there is plenty of time to recover from a mild winter. We adjust to these types of issues all the time.  But I\u2019m sure you\u2019re more interested in the last half of March and what April tells us about the future. I\u2019ll get into all that in a minute, but first let\u2019s just do the headlines, the financial headlines for the quarter. For the first quarter, we came in with operating earnings of $1.02 per share. We are reaffirming our 2020 operating earnings guidance range of $4.25 to $4.45 per share and our 5% to 7% long term growth rate. AEP is doing this because, regardless of whether we forecast a V-shaped, a U-shaped or W-shaped COVID-19 recovery, we see our service territory as an arbitrage between residential load and commercial industrial load that is defined really by a pendulum between the financial characteristics of working from home versus the restart of commercial and industrial businesses. With all of this considered along with capital, O&M, credit metrics and updated load forecasts and actions we have taken, we expect to be the lower half of our guidance range. We are shifting $500 million of capital spending, substantially contracted renewable business and corporate-related capital for the time being to maintain our commitments to solid credit ratings. We are reaffirming our $33 billion of capital over the five-year period, however. We believe this to be the smart play given our ability to adjust capital quickly to respond to market conditions. We give all of this guidance insight given an exhaustive review county by county of our service territory from a load perspective through April, weather impacts thus far in the year, and expense control measures already put in place to respond to present conditions.  We will continue to refine these assumptions as data become available. Certainly weather, customer load mix, pace of economic recovery and continued O&M related actions will dictate further positive progress within the guidance range. Brian will get into more detail about these assumptions, but I want to reaffirm for you that our balance sheet is strong, credit metrics are good, and liquidity is secure as we move forward. Let\u2019s move on to the specifics related to COVID-19 and its implications to our operations and our financials as we see the year progressing. As many have heard, there is famous boxing quote from Iron Mike Tyson that is truly appropriate here : \u201cEveryone has a plan until they get punched in the mouth.\u201d Well, that\u2019s what we have faced in the end of this quarter and will face probably for the rest of the year, but I\u2019m here to tell you, yes, we\u2019ve been challenged a little bit but we are very much still in the match because of our quick responses and agility to be in the position to reaffirm our existing guidance range.  I\u2019ll start by discussing our employees\u2019 commitments to our customers, communities, and our shareholders as we move through the crisis that I referred to at the beginning of my presentation. First, I want to recognize all the healthcare and first responders who have put themselves in the line of fire to help us all to be more safe and healthy. As a critical infrastructure service company, the frontline employees of our utility have also taken on risk by ensuring we are out in the field responding to substantial storm activity to ensure the resiliency and reliability of electric service so that our hospitals, critical businesses, and customers who are under stay-at-home provisions can continue to benefit at least from some degree of comfort in these challenging times. We have instituted protection measures for these employees that reflect CDC guidance regarding physical distancing, including smaller work teams, proper hygiene, and appropriate PPE and testing to minimize risk of contact with the virus.  Approximately 12,000, over 70% of AEP\u2019s employees have been working from home for several weeks now and will continue to work from home even after stay-at-home provisions are lifted to ensure further precautions are taken both at home and at the office for employees who must return for various reasons. We have instituted specific COVID-19 adjustments to our health plans and benefits for employees, and as a critical infrastructure business have continued to pay our employees as they work from home. For most field-level employees, we have also awarded additional days off with pay to enable more time with their families during this time. We have over 82% of our call center employees working from home, and as they not only answer customer questions, they are also helping our small businesses get back on their feet by helping them navigate through the SBA loan provisions of the Cares Act. Regarding our customers, we recognize the hardships that this pandemic has brought on and have temporarily suspended all service disconnects for non-payment, and our team of call center professionals have been working diligently to administer more flexible payment arrangements for our commercial and residential customers. Some states have mandated this, but we do so voluntarily and our state commissions have fully supported these actions through the establishment of deferred accounting and other measures, which I want to take the time to thank them for addressing these issues. Regarding our communities, the AEP Foundation has donated over $3 million to support basic human needs to help address hardships from food security, housing, clothing, and other issues during this time. We have donated over 9,000 N95 masks, 110,000 gloves and disposable surgical masks, and 1,200 face shields from our warehouse stocks and 3D printing facilities within our innovation labs.  In my 37 years of being in this business, I have never seen the level of coordination and concern by multiple agencies to do the right thing for our customers, our employees, our businesses and communities. While much focus on this call is on the financials, it is important to remember the part we play in the broader social fabric as a critical infrastructure business. Our effectiveness is defined by the level of cooperation and support from all of the agencies that we deal with : our state commissions and governors\u2019 offices, federal and state legislators, FERC, NERC, DoE, DHS, NRC and others. They all have answered the call, and we at AEP thank them. There is much work yet to do, but I believe all have embraced the capital-S for social from an ESG investor perspective.  From the operational side, we have had no disruptions to plant or grid operations while storm activity has been exceptional, given the significant storm activity in several of our operating company territories and considering the additional COVID-19 related safety precautions. There has not been a delay in the north central wind facilities construction and the regulatory cases regarding this project have continued on schedule. As well, future rate cases are on track to be filed, including in Ohio and Kentucky. On the regulatory front, it has been a busy quarter. In fact, we have already received approvals for 96% of the budgeted regulatory recovery for 2020. In March, the Indiana Regulatory Commission authorized a $77 million revenue increased based on a 9.7% ROE. The Commission approved IN\u2019s proposed distribution system investments and full tracking of FERC transmission costs. The company had also sought an adjustment to reflect the reallocation of capacity costs associated with termination of certain wholesale contracts which was denied by the Commission. We have filed for re-hearing on this matter. In January, the Michigan Commission approved the settlement of the base rate case resulting in an increase of $36 million based on a 9.86% ROE. In April, the PUCT - Public Utility Commission of Texas issued a final order approving the settlement agreement in the AEP Texas base rate case, allowing for a 9.4% ROE with a 42.5% equity layer on the company\u2019s $5 billion asset base. Also in April, we filed a DCRF - distribution cost recovery factor to add approximately $440 million in assets to the rate base for distribution investments we made to benefit our customers in AEP Texas. A T-cost filing - transmission cost filing was also made to recover $800 million in transmission investments made over a similar time frame. The company also filed a required base rate case in Virginia as part of the state\u2019s annual review. In that filing, the company asked for a 9.9% ROE on a 50/50 cap structure on a $2.5 billion base, resulting in an increase of $64.9 million. Rates would be effective at the end of January 2021.  There is no question that these are unprecedented times. I think it goes without saying that we will need to ensure that utilities and commissions work together to devise creative solutions to the challenges we all face.  Tony Clark, former Commissioners at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission prepared and submitted a white paper to NERUC recognizing the unique challenges the energy industry is facing and the need for regulators to be creative to new solutions. In that article, he called for policymakers at both the federal and state level to be proactive in both the short and long term by targeting measures that support both customers and utilities. Collectively with our legislators and our commissions, we need to work together to recognize the importance of protecting customers and ensuring utilities are able to invest in their systems and maintain the level of service that our communities depend upon, whether through deferrals or preferably riders or forward-looking test years, because cash is king again for utilities to be able to adequately invest in critical infrastructure.  Two examples within our service territory where the Commissions have taken a proactive view have been in Texas and Ohio. We believe both are steps in the right direction. In Texas, the Commission approved the COVID-19 Electricity Relief Program for residential consumers who are having difficulty paying their bills. A rider has been put in place to fund the ERP that enables AEP Texas to access cash to begin the program cost. In Ohio, Commission staff recommended approval of the regulatory asset deferral for future recovery and recovery of the demand ratchet program costs through the existing economic development rider. This will help lessen the impact to industrials who are key employers within the state and protect utilities. We believe both are examples of progressive moves by states to help mitigate the risk associated with COVID-19 to both customers and provide certainty for utilities. Moving on to the North Central project, we continue to make progress on this landmark project that provides significant benefits for our 1.1 million customers in our PSO and SWEPCO states. We received approval of the unanimous settlement in Oklahoma as well as FERC approval in the first quarter. We expected May to be an important month for the project for the remaining jurisdictions, and I\u2019m pleased to report that yesterday the Arkansas Public Service Commission approved the 155 megawatts, or approximately 10% of the total project along with the flex-up option. As you recall, the flex-up option allows Arkansas to increase the megawatt allocation should another SWEPCO state reject the application. The Commission in that order determined that SWEPCO should use it\u2019s formulative rate rider to recover its costs.  In early March, we filed the unanimous settlement in Louisiana for 268 megawatts or approximately 18% of the total project, which also included the flex-up option. We expect a decision by the Louisiana Public Service Commission in the May or June time frame. Lastly, after concluding our hearings in February, we expect a proposal for commission decision for the Texas ALJs in late May. With approvals in Oklahoma, Arkansas and FERC under our belt, the project has what it needs to go forward at 846 megawatts of the 1,485 megawatt project. Of course, the project can move forward with even more savings for customers and the full $2 billion investment opportunity if either the LPSC approves with the flex-up option or the LPSC and the Public Utility Commission of Texas approves their portion of the full project. Now let\u2019s talk to the equalizer chart. Most of these are weather related, but for AEP Ohio we\u2019ve had the roll-off of some of the legacy fuel and capacity carrying charges. They rolled off, so we expect the trend for the ROE to be at the authorized levels of around 10%. Presently, it\u2019s at 9.9% for quarter 2020. In APCO, the ROE for APCO at the end of first quarter is 8.7%, and that\u2019s driven by lower normalized usage and higher depreciation from increased capital investments, and of course unfavorable weather. Virginia\u2019s first triannual review was filed in March 2020, as I mentioned earlier, and it covers the 2017 to 2019 periods. An ROE of 9.42% would be used for the triannual review with 70 basis point bandwidth of 8.72% to 10.12% ROE.  Kentucky Power, the ROE for Kentucky Power at the end of first quarter was 6.7%, and that\u2019s primarily driven by loss of load from weak economic conditions, loss of major customers along with higher expenses and unfavorable weather. We also have been in a stay out provision associated with rate filings, but that goes away here soon and we expect to be filing in Kentucky in the July time frame. I&M, the ROE at I&M is at 10.5%, and we\u2019ve been implementing new rates for Indianan which will take place in the second quarter, but we fully expect to be at the authorized areas of around 9.7% to 9.86%. Then for PSO, PSO is at 9.2% primarily driven by unfavorable weather. SWEPCO at the end of first quarter was 6.2%, and that was because of a loss of load, unfavorable weather, and continued impact of the Arkansas share of the Turk plant, which accounts for about 112 basis points. The Arkansas base case settlement went in place in December 2019 and is effective January 2020, approved a $24 million revenue increase there.  In AEP Texas, it\u2019s at 8% and that\u2019s due to a lag associated with the timing of annual filings and one-time adjustments from our recently finalized base rate case. Favorable regulatory treatment has historically allowed us to file annual DCRF and biannual T-cost filings to recover our cost, and I mentioned those earlier, so there\u2019s a lag associated with those but we should see a pick-up there and drive more toward a 9.4% ROE in the long term. Then the transmission holdco at the end of the first quarter was 11.5% and it was driven by higher revenues due to differences between actual and forecasted revenues, so we fully expect the transmission ROE to be in the mid-10% range in 2020. With that, when there is a pandemic like the one we\u2019re experiencing today that has not occurred in 100 years, and this nation\u2019s economy has been effectively shut down for months, there is no question that everyone is challenged and AEP is no exception. We are up to the challenge to recognize not only the role that this company has in the resiliency and restart of our economy as well as the provision of electric service no matter where our customers are working or living, but also the importance of the consistency and quality of earnings and dividends to our shareholders that makes our work possible. We will strike that balance, respond to challenges, and I\u2019ll stick with a boxing analogy with a Sylvester Stallone movie, Rocky, where the music is playing, the theme from Rocky and he\u2019s running up the steps that represent the adversity of reaching a goal. I believe at the end of the year, we all - AEP, the communities we serve, our customers and our shareholders - will be at the summit, raising our arms in victory.  Brian? Brian Tierney : Thank you Nick, and good morning everyone. I will take us through the financial results for the quarter, provide some insight in how we\u2019re thinking about 2020, including an update on April load, and finish with a review of our balance sheet and liquidity. Let\u2019s stop briefly on Slide 7, which shows the comparison of GAAP to operating earnings for the quarter. GAAP earnings were $1.00 per share compared to $1.16 per share in 2019. There is a reconciliation of GAAP to operating earnings in the appendix.  Let\u2019s turn to Slide 8 and look at the drivers of quarterly operating earnings. Operating earnings for the first quarter were $1.02 per share or $504 million, compared to $1.19 per share of $585 million in 2019. Looking at the drivers by segment, operating earnings for vertically integrated utilities were $0.50 per share, down $0.13. Earnings in this segment declined primarily due to warmer than normal winter weather and lower normalized retail load. Other small decreases included higher depreciation, higher tax expense and lower wholesale load, AFUDC, and off-system sales. Favorable drivers included rate changes and higher transmission revenue. The transmission and distribution utilities segment earned $0.24 per share, down $0.08 from last year primarily driven by the 2019 reversal of a regulatory provision in Ohio. Other smaller drivers included higher depreciation, the roll-off of legacy riders in Ohio, and unfavorable weather. These items were partially offset by higher rate changes, normalized retail load, and recovery of increased transmission investment in ERCOT, as well as lower O&M.  The AEP transmission holdco segment continued to grow, contributing $0.28 per share, an improvement of $0.03 over last year. Net plant increased by $1.5 billion or 18% since March of last year. Generation and marketing produced earnings of $0.07 per share, down $0.02 from last year. The renewables business grew with the acquisition of multiple renewable assets. Increases in retail margins were more than offset by timing around income taxes and lower generation sales due to lower energy prices and plant retirements. Finally, corporate and other was up $0.03 per share primarily driven by lower taxes relating to a prior year income tax adjustment and other consolidating items that were reversed by year end, other variances related to higher interest expense, and lower O&M.  Earlier in the call, Nick indicated that we are reaffirming our 2020 operating earnings guidance range of $4.25 per share to $4.45 per share and would likely be in the lower half of that range. Let me give you some of the detail that leads us to that outcome on Slide 9 and then I\u2019ll provide more detail on each of the key assumptions in the following slides. Our economic forecasting group uses Moody\u2019s analytics as a key input to our models. In April, Moody\u2019s published a county-level forecast that included the projected impact of COVID-19 on our service territory. We used this new data along with updated assumptions from our customer service engineers to come up with revised retail sales projections for the year. We now expect residential sales to increase 3% over 2019 levels largely driven by all of the activity that has taken place in residences rather than in places of work or in the classroom. Conversely, we are anticipating commercial sales contractions of 5.6% and industrial sales declines of 8% over 2019 levels.  Many businesses have shifted their operations to a mostly online platform while other employers have had to make the difficult decision to furlough or reduce employee headcount until market demand is restored. These retail forecasts lead us to expect an overall decline in sales of 3.4%. This updated load would impact our prior forecast negatively by $0.15 per share. We have already discussed our year to date negative impact from mild weather of $0.11 per share. In response to these circumstances, we have taken action to reduce untracked operations and maintenance expenses by an additional $100 million, resulting in a positive expectation of $0.17 per share for the year. The net result of load, weather and O&M reductions would have a negative $0.09 per share impact for the year, leaving us inside but in the lower half of the original operating earnings guidance range. We realize moratoriums on disconnects and the economic impact to our customers may have on our cash receipts. In response to this, we have initiated a shift of $500 million of capital expenditures out of 2020 to be placed into the future years of 2021 to 2024. As we made these deferrals, we were mindful of customer and reliability impacts. In fact, about $200 million of these investments were in our competitive renewables business and about $100 million were corporate investments. The shifts can be ramped up or down going forward in response to how events play out in real time. With this moderate level of capital shifting, we are able to reaffirm our 5% to 7% long term growth rate off of our original 2019 operating earnings guidance range.  Regarding potential increases in bad debt across our jurisdictions, we have already received orders in Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana and Virginia to set up regulatory assets related to COVID-19 costs. Other states where we have filed for recovery of COVID-related deferrals include Ohio, Michigan, Tennessee, and Oklahoma. We have tried on this slide to provide some of the detail for how the coronavirus and oil and gas events will impact AEP\u2019s operating earnings for 2020. Instead of taking you through the details of our scenario planning, let me highlight some of the items that could positively and negatively impact our view as we make our way through the year. On the positive side, a sharp V-shape recovery that is more dramatic than the gradual recovery from the second quarter low point that we have assumed would improve results. Additionally, mitigation of coronavirus infection rates leading the economy to open up sooner than we have assumed would improve results. A greater increase in residential sales and an improvement in commercial and industrial sales would further improve our outlook. We have experienced a mild winter. If that carried forward into a warmer than normal summer, that would have positive earnings implications. Another positive would be if we could garner incremental savings to what we have assumed at the $2.7 billion level of untracked O&M expenses. The items that would create negative impacts to our assumptions are largely the opposite of the positives. A prolonged U-shaped or a dramatic L-shaped recovery would be more negative than our assumptions. Increased coronavirus infection rates could lead to weaker economic conditions for longer periods than we have assumed, potential impairing our outlook for the year. In addition, continued mild weather and/or O&M expenses beyond our control, like for storms, could negatively impact the outlook for 2020.  We have tried our best using data, experience and judgment to update and share our outlook with you for 2020. We have tried not to be unreasonably optimistic nor pessimistic. This outlook allows us to reaffirm our 2020 operating earnings guidance range with a view that we are likely to be in the lower half of the range. Now let\u2019s turn to Slide 10 and provide an update on our system load, focusing on our outlook for the balance of the year. Our first quarter normalized load was down seven-tenths of a percent compared to last year. Our residential and industrial sales were both down for the quarter while commercial sales were essentially flat. Our original guidance for the year assumed half a percent normalized load growth. Clearly a lot has changed since that forecast was developed. Since then, we have taken a fresh look at our forecast and now expect our total load to end the year down 3.4% on a weather normalized basis, with meaningful changes in customer mix and related margins. For 2020, we anticipate a significant contraction in the second quarter followed by a gradual recovery over the balance of the year. In the upper left quadrant, we raised our residential outlook for 2020 to 3%. We are seeing significant increases in our residential load during the stay-at-home period. Even after our states begin to reopen their economies in the second quarter, it is our expectation that many employees will continue to work from home. Having said this, we expect the strongest residential growth in the second quarter with some tapering off during the second half of the year. Moving clockwise, our commercial sales outlook is now assuming a 5.6% decline from 2019 levels. Prior to the COVID outbreak, we experienced consistent improvement in our commercial sales class over the past year; however, once the stay-at-home provisions were in place, we experienced significant declines in our sales to traditional retail stores, hotels, restaurants, churches and schools. However, not all commercial load was negatively impacted by the outbreak. Sales to hospitals and government support offices were up substantially in the first quarter. When you consider the challenges many businesses will face trying to introduce social distancing protocols into their normal operations, we are projecting a difficult second quarter for commercial sales with modest improvement through the remainder of the year. Finally, in the lower left chart the outlook for industrial sales has changed significantly. We now expect 2020 industrial sales to come in 8% below 2019 levels. A number of factors have changed the outlook for this class, but the biggest driver is the overall drop in economic activity. Over the past several weeks, we have learned a number of large industrial customers that were either idling their production or reducing their output temporarily until market conditions improve. In addition, a number of expansions we had previously assumed to come online later this year have been delayed or postponed. These delays should be reversed as the economy gradually recovers. Since nearly 30% of our industrial sales come from the oil and gas sectors, let me explain recent sales trends in this sector. Surprisingly, sales to the oil and gas sectors in the first quarter increased by 9.7%, which was the strongest quarter we\u2019ve experienced since 2016. Most of that growth came from the pipeline transportation sector which was up 28% for the first quarter. Going forward, we expect some reduction in oil and gas extraction that will be offset by growth in the midstream and downstream operations. We don\u2019t normally report on monthly load numbers, but since we had the data, let\u2019s take a look at April load on Slide 11. Total normalized retail load for April was down 4.3% with the relationship between the retail classes being similar to what we assumed for the balance of the year. Not surprising given the number of people relegated to their homes, normalized residential sales were up 6% for the month. Equally not surprising, normalized commercial sales were down 7.7% for the month, with the biggest declines being in schools, churches, restaurants and hotels. Industrial sales were down 10% for the month. The biggest decline was in sectors that support the automotive industry, while we experienced strong sales growth in pipeline transportation and food manufacturing sectors.  Looking at April\u2019s results, the relationship between the classes, also know as sales mix, as well as the levels of sales in each class are consistent with the assumptions we have made for the second quarter of our balance of year assumptions. Moving on to Slide 12, let\u2019s discuss some load sensitivities and highlight some of our rate recovery mechanisms. The three pie charts show that by segment and in total, about half of our non-fuel revenues come from the residential class. Applying the 3% growth we are now projecting for residential sales in total to the sensitivities we provided at last year\u2019s EEI financial conference, we would pick up $0.12 a share from higher residential sales. Repeating the same calculations for the projected load loss in the commercial and industrial classes would produce a drag of approximately $0.11 and $0.16 per share respectively. When you add these three impacts together, you get the $0.15 per share impact we identified on Slide 9. Finally, retail rate design has a couple of features that stabilize our revenues during an economic downturn. First, most of our large industrial tariffs include demand provisions designed to cover the fixed portion of utility costs. These provisions remain in place even when volumes are down. Second, in our residential customer class we have had some success over the years better aligning the fixed portion of customer rates with fixed costs. Together these rate considerations provide a stabilizing effect on our revenues even when sales volumes decline. Turning to Slide 13, another key assumption is the weather. As mentioned earlier, weather in the first quarter was extremely mild. The green bar in the first quarter shows that mild weather cost us $71 million compared to normal, which was $65 million worse than the first quarter of last year. While our outlook assumes normal weather for the remainder of the year, this chart shows that weather can change significantly, as evidenced by last year\u2019s experience. If we were to have another warm summer like we did in 2019, it could offset the $0.11 drag for weather in the first quarter that we showed you on Slide 9. Our management team has a proven track record of adapting our plans to changing conditions as necessary. In years when the weather has provided a tailwind, we have accelerated spending to provide stability to our earnings in line with our 5% to 7% growth targets. In years where weather has been less accommodating, we have been able to shift our spending to future years to achieve the same goal. You can expect this management team will react similarly this year. Turning to Slide 14, you can see that for nine years now, we have maintained O&M discipline and kept spending net of offsets in a tight range of between $2.8 billion and $3.1 billion. We had originally planned to drive down O&M costs in 2020 to $2.8 billion. In response to the expected decline in sales, we now plan to reduce O&M spend by an additional $100 million. Plans like the Achieving Excellence program and additional one-time and extraordinary reductions will help us to achieve those reductions. Now let\u2019s move on to Slide15 and review the company\u2019s capitalization and liquidity. Our debt to total capital ratio increased during the quarter from 59.8% to 61.8%. The increase in the debt component is attributable to financings to support our ongoing investment program and to fortify our liquidity position to ensure smooth operational financing during this period of market volatility. As you would expect, the increase in debt combined with the ongoing pressure associated with the flow back of ADIT resulted in pressure on our FFO to debt metric, which at quarter end stood at 12.5% on a Moody\u2019s basis. The decline in the metric is also temporarily influenced by the $1 billion 364-day term loan the company proactively obtained in late March. Despite the temporary decline in this metric, rating agencies view this enhanced liquidity as credit positive. Adjusting for this facility and associated cash balances, the metric would be 13%. Our liquidity at the end of the quarter remained strong at $2.8 billion. Since then, our commercial paper balances have dropped to $1.6 billion and our liquidity position has increased to $3.1 billion. Our qualified pension funding increased approximately 4% to 93%, and our OPEB funding decreased approximately 15% to 130%. Pension and OPEB equity returns were negative 23% and negative 22% respectively for the quarter and were the primary reasons pensions and OPEB funding decreased. Fixed income returns of approximately 7% and 6% in the pension and OPEB respectively served to offset some of the equity losses. We have worked hard over the years to focus on pension and OPEB funding and are pleased with how the asset portfolios have performed in spite of recent market volatility. Let\u2019s wrap this up on Slide 16 so we can quickly get to your questions. In response to the economic downturn and related implications, AEP has responded to quickly reduce our O&M spending by an additional $100 million for 2020. This action combined with our updated load forecast allows us to reaffirm our existing operating earnings guidance of 2020 from $4.25 to $4.45 per share. In addition, in response to uncertainties about cash flows related to reduced customer demand and potential delays in customer receipts, we are shifting about $500 million in capital expenditures out of 2020 and into the period 2021 to 2024. We can adjust the timing and size of this shift in reaction to how events play out relative to our assumptions. Because of our ability to continue to invest in our own system organically, we are confident in our ability to grow the company at our stated long term growth rate of 5% to 7%. We continue to make progress on obtaining approvals for our $2 billion North Central wind project in Oklahoma and plan to proceed when approvals are obtained. With that, I will turn the call over to the operator for your questions. Operator : [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Steve Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Steve Byrd : Hi, good morning. Hope you all are doing well. Nick Akins : Morning Steve. Steve Byrd : Thanks for the update on a lot of topics. Wanted to talk first just about two of your rate cases, Indiana and Michigan, where I believe the test year is going to be a 2020 test year. How do you think about that sort of test year in light of COVID - you know, load adjustments, COVID-related expenses as you think through that rate case, and sort of how to approach 2020 given it\u2019s such an unusual year? Nick Akins : In at least Indiana, we have forward test year views, and I think it\u2019s probably going to be particularly important as we go in for these cases for there to be an understanding that we are dealing with a COVID-related year if it is a test year. Wherever you have forward test years, though, you can account for that going forward in the rate making, but we\u2019d be tuned into the process whether you pro forma in or do other things. I think there\u2019s probably at least opportunities for discussion about that because COVID--you know, 2020 is going to be an usual year and to be used for test years would be particularly challenging. You have to really go to some form of pro forma view that has the level of investments, the level of business activity that you would normally see. So, I would expect our commissions to be reasonable in that approach. Brian Tierney : You know, in both those cases, Steve, we had forward-looking test years and we do have orders effective in both of those jurisdictions. Steve Byrd : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Yes, it makes sense that you\u2019d sort of try to work to the adjustments. It makes sense.  On North Central wind, some great progress there. That\u2019s really encouraging. I guess I had sort of two related questions on North Central. If you do get those additional approvals that you\u2019re waiting for, such as in Louisiana, Texas, can you quickly flex the plan to go to the higher megawatt level? Then relatedly, you\u2019ve obviously deferred some capex. Do you have that flexibility to deploy whatever capital you need to, to make this a bigger project, or does your capital position caution against significant ramp-up in capex this year? Just thinking through the growth at North Central. Nick Akins : Yes, so originally North Central was not in our capital plan, and so when we get approval for that, that\u2019d be dealing with a different financing model associated with that. As far as the megawatt level and the amount of investment, yes, if we get approval for Louisiana for example, and Louisiana also approves the up rate which is in a settlement arrangement, then we would have the full $2 billion investment opportunity there. We already know we\u2019re going forward with the project - that was the importance of Arkansas approval, so the project is moving forward. The question is what size, and then when Louisiana approves that, and hopefully with a flex-up as well, then that\u2019s the full $2 billion, or if Texas takes their portion, then all operating jurisdictions will be taking their particular portions as we go forward. Now, there is additional opportunity for renewables in those areas. The integrated resource plans have the capability for that, but we felt like, as we originally said about this project, there is sort of a break point between the opportunities that existed around the wind farm project and the pricing, and we wanted to make absolutely sure that the pricing was very effective and produced very positive savings for our customers. So, we can always go out for a bid again to fill the rest of that from a resource planning perspective. Brian Tierney : Steve, we\u2019ll be full speed ahead on the capex associated with North Central wind one way or the other. Nick mentioned that it\u2019s not in the $33 billion that we had previously identified for the five years, 2020 to 2024, and we previously said that we anticipate an equity component of that investment to be between 50% and 66%. Steve Byrd : That\u2019s super helpful. I\u2019ll let others ask questions. Thank you. Nick Akins : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Durgesh Chopra with Evercore. Please go ahead. Durgesh Chopra : Hey, good morning guys. Thanks for taking my question. I have two. The first one on 2020 guidance range here, the $0.15 EPS hit, what are you assuming in terms of decline trends for the rest of the year? I guess what I\u2019m asking is are you--as you make some amount of recovery in Q3 or Q4, just curious as to what you\u2019re assuming in terms of profiling for the rest of the year. Brian Tierney : Sure, so we are assuming that the second quarter would be the lowest quarter for load, and that there would be a gradual recovery over the balance of 2020 and into the first quarter of 2021. Durgesh Chopra : Got it, perfect. Then, can you comment on just your--you know, assuming that you hit your lower half of the EPS guidance range for this year, where would that put you in terms of credit metrics [indiscernible] debt versus your targeted metrics? Then any color that you can provide us with your recent conversations that you have had with Moody\u2019s on some of the changes that you\u2019ve made to your plan? Brian Tierney : We\u2019ve really been--we anticipate year end being FFO to debt in that 13% to 14% range. We\u2019ve communicated that with S&P and Moody\u2019s, had dialogues with them as late as yesterday. They understand where we are and what we\u2019re doing. I think they were encouraged to see us flex a little bit our capex for the balance of the year in response to anticipated lower cash flows than what we had anticipated, and they\u2019re supportive of that. They were--they viewed what Julie and her team did around the term loan facility as being credit positive, and they are fully aware and apprised of what we\u2019re doing. You should ask them, but I think their answer would be supportive. Durgesh Chopra : Great, that\u2019s all I had, guys. Thank you very much. Nick Akins : Thank you, Durgesh. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Julien Dumoulin : Hey, good morning team. I hope you\u2019re all well. Perhaps just to pick up where the last question left off to start here. On guidance and the 2020 lower half, how do you think about the reduction in capex? I just want to reconcile this. It seems as if you\u2019re not really changing FFO to debt expectations as you are bringing down capex altogether, but why do that relative to no change in earnings? Can you walk through the thought process there?  Then also, it seems as if it doesn\u2019t necessarily have too much of an earnings impact given the corporate nature of some of the capex, so I just want to make sure we\u2019re thinking about that correctly as well. Brian Tierney : Sure Julien, thanks for the question. We are anticipating there to be some reduction in cash flow this year associated with two things : one, lower customer demand, and then two, we have eliminated disconnects currently, and so we think that customers will pay us slower than what they have in the past. We\u2019re not seeing the impact of that in a significant way yet - it\u2019s too early, but in anticipation of lower cash flows to maintain those FFO to debt metrics, we felt it was prudent to at least engage the motor on our ability to scale back capex. In regards to the no impact on future earnings, we tried to do it in places that have either lower regulatory lag or the increase in earnings isn\u2019t as great. Nick mentioned that some of that reduction is in the competitive renewables space and some of that reduction is also at corporate capital, things like IT and things like that, that are much slower to flow into customer rates during rate cases. Things that we are careful not to cut were things like transmission, where we\u2019re spending on customer resilience and reliability and we have those formula-based rates to update and get that capex into rates on a fairly efficient basis. We were really thoughtful about how we cut that or shifted that small amount of capex, and made sure that it wasn\u2019t impacting earnings. Nick Akins : Julien, I think you\u2019re reading it right, though - we\u2019re being as transparent as we possibly can be through this process using the latest information. Matter of fact, we got the load information, April load information yesterday, so we\u2019re trying to be as transparent as possible, but also taking the right, smart, appropriate steps to ensure that we\u2019re able to be agile enough to do what we need to do. I think you\u2019re reading that right.  We obviously would put that capital back in as quickly as possible and then, as Brian mentioned, we\u2019re not only mitigating any impacts to the earnings capability but also thinking ahead in terms of where we deploy that capital in the future. Then we also have North Central coming about, so those things are occurring. We\u2019re trying to manage through this year in a very positive fashion and really a defensive posture, and then set ourselves up for the future years, in \u201921 and beyond. We\u2019ll continue that approach, and obviously if we get a hot summer, for example, we\u2019ll throw capital back in - there\u2019s all kinds of things we can adjust, and then from a residential standpoint, you heard our residential load for April was 6%, and we\u2019re saying 3%, so we don\u2019t know exactly how this is going to play out, particularly with changing dynamics of business cases themselves changing. I mean, we had Nationwide recently come out and say that their people are going to be working from home, and we have 17,000 employees and 12,000 are working from home. We may be looking through our Achieving Excellence program, which we have already accelerated, to look at how you look at people working from home and maybe the whole business cases changes from that perspective and also reduces O&M further.  So we\u2019re in the process of doing all that, but we\u2019re just trying to be as transparent as possible. But you\u2019re reading the tea leaves right. Julien Dumoulin : Got it, excellent. Let me just clarify this from the transcript - you all reaffirmed intentions to file rate cases in various geographies. This doesn\u2019t shift timing necessarily, it sounds like, nor--at the same time, I don\u2019t want to tie one to the other, does it shift any expectations with respect to asset sales, disposals, strategic reviews? Just want to make sure we\u2019re on the same page there, and there could be some further capital needs. Nick Akins : No, it doesn\u2019t change. As a matter of fact, we\u2019ll continue those cases. Obviously, as I mentioned, in Kentucky we have a stay out provision. We need to file a case, and we\u2019ll do that when that stay out provision is lifted, and then that would be effective January 1 of 2021. Then for Ohio, obviously we\u2019re due to file a case there as well. It\u2019s a pretty moderate case, but nevertheless.  As far as we can tell, everything is going exactly like we had planned. Now, you may see some procedural schedules change, but the end result and the end dates aren\u2019t changing, so that\u2019s where we\u2019re at today. Julien Dumoulin : Great, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Nick Akins : Morning Michael. Michael Lapides : She did a better job pronouncing my last name than most people do. Nick Akins : I have the same problem. Michael Lapides : I had a handful of questions. One, I\u2019m going to be a little more specific on capex, so $500 million cut, $200 million is at the non-regulated renewable-- Nick Akins : Michael, $500 million shifted. Michael Lapides : Shifted - my bad. Nick Akins : We\u2019re sensitive about that! Michael Lapides : Five hundred shifted, 200 is at the non-regulated renewable, 100 is at corporate. What\u2019s the other 200? Brian Tierney : There\u2019s another $75 million to $100 million that is in our distribution at our opcos, and then the other $100 million is spread across our organizations but not in the transmission side of the business. Michael Lapides : Got it, okay. That\u2019s fine. The other question is, is there any scenario where you could delay, given all that\u2019s going on in the world, all the uncertainty about demand, about the impact of disconnects, is there any regulatory scenario where you could actually postpone or push out the AEP Ohio rate case? Nick Akins : No, we don\u2019t see that happening because obviously we\u2019re required to file a case, and actually it\u2019s a pretty moderate case, so I think that there really isn\u2019t any reason to delay it at this point. Brian Tierney : Michael, I think Nick\u2019s answer earlier was there could be a delay in the procedural schedule. We would still expect to get the result of the case when we originally had. Nick Akins : Yes. Michael Lapides : Got it. Then final question-- Nick Akins : And everybody knows about it as well, so it won\u2019t be a surprise to anybody. There\u2019s a pretty negligible impact on customers too in that case. Michael Lapides : Yes, that makes a ton of sense. Then last question, you all have done a great job in managing down O&M for the last four years, and you\u2019ve taken a lot of O&M out of the company. It saves the customers money, it\u2019s good for shareholders. At what point do you think the long term rate of change in O&M management starts to flatten out, meaning the curve, the ability to keep taking out more or become more efficient just starts to flatten out, the pace of change slows. Nick Akins : You know, we\u2019ve had a lot of conversations about that, but every day you\u2019re surprised by some new innovation or something that can change the trajectory of O&M expense. We spend $4 billion a year, I think $2.8 billion is not tracked, and when you look at some of the opportunities that are available, and actually I think if there is a silver lining in the coronavirus pandemic, it is that we can really re-evaluate what it means to get our business done, because we\u2019ve been very effective at the people working from home and actually productivity has not suffered as a result. We still have obviously the field employees that are still out there working as well, but you see the innovations that are occurring. I think we have years ahead of us to continue to optimize O&M expense, and when you think it\u2019s going to level out, something new comes about and I think that\u2019s going to be a continual opportunity for us. We actually--and you probably we announced we have a new senior vice president over our--actually, the digital experience, our Chief Information and Technology Officer who is joining the company, we wanted to make sure that we put technology and the customer experience, and certainly our charge innovation hub and those kinds of things together to really focus the organization on what the future holds and what it can mean in terms of O&M in the future. I think we don\u2019t know the answer to that, and really you don\u2019t want to know, you want to just keep pressing forward, and we\u2019ll do that. Michael Lapides : Got it, thank you Nick. Much appreciated. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeremy Hulme [ph] with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Jeremy Hulme : Hi, good morning. Thanks for having me here. I could be wrong, but I think in the past you might have provided a multi-year view of financing needs in the earnings deck. I think I might have missed that here, so didn\u2019t know if there any changes to how you\u2019re thinking about funding capex going forward here, and is there any interplay with where Moody\u2019s is at right now as you think about this? Brian Tierney : Jeremy, there\u2019s really no change in how we\u2019re funding capex. I think the big thing we did really with the last call was give some insight into how we were going to fund more Central wind and the idea that we\u2019d be doing that between 50% and 60% equity. We\u2019ve always been fairly conservative in our balance sheet management, and we\u2019re going to continue that going forward. Jeremy Hulme : Got it. That\u2019s it for me. Thanks for taking my question. Brian Tierney : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of James Thalacker with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. James Thalacker : Hey, how are you guys? Thanks for taking my call. Nick Akins : Sure. James Thalacker : Just following up on Jeremy\u2019s question, just wondering, Brian and Nick, as you guys are getting closer to North Central wind approvals, have you sharpened your idea on how you\u2019re thinking about financing that, and especially have you looked a little bit more maybe some cycling some current assets, as opposed to accessing the capital markets specifically? Brian Tierney : James, we do have a little bit of time for that, right? The smaller portion of North Central wind is going to come, about $300 million at the end of \u201920, which would really make the financing of that a \u201921 event. Then we have really until the end of \u201921 to go forward with that, so how we come up with the equity portion of that, whether it\u2019s capital rotation or whether it\u2019s the equity capital markets, are still things that we have plenty of time to work through. I think the important assumption was the range of percentage of equity that we\u2019d use for that project, and that\u2019s where we talked about being in the 50% to 66% of the project. Nick Akins : Yes, and really probably the main message is all the options that were available to us before are still on the table and still being considered. There hasn\u2019t been any change from a timing perspective in our ability to get that done, so I\u2019d say we\u2019re still at the same place we were and we\u2019re ready to execute. I think it\u2019s just a matter of us getting the ducks all in a row to ensure that we\u2019re at the right place at the right time. James Thalacker : Sure. I just wasn\u2019t sure if you guys were looking at the potential for augmenting some of the equity with the recycling of assets, if there became a regulatory proceeding or something like that, that would have to be taken into consideration ahead of time just because of-- Nick Akins : Yes, and we\u2019ve said for really over a year now that with capital rotation, but also sale of assets is on the table as part of that process. We\u2019re obligated to do that from a shareholder perspective, and we will certainly do that. James Thalacker : Got it. Thank you very much. Appreciate the time. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sophia Karp with Keybanc. Nick Akins : Morning Sophia. Sophia Karp : Hi. Good morning, thank you for taking my question. A couple of questions here for me. Can you remind us if North Central wind was contemplating tax equity financing as part of the plan? Brian Tierney : It is not. Sophia Karp : Okay, so then maybe another one for me. I know you guys have a pretty decent chunk of your workforce that was on track to retire within the next, call it five, seven years maybe. Are you contemplating offering them, these folks some sort of voluntary early retirement, maybe in an effort to cut O&M? Is that something that we could see on the table? Nick Akins : Well, I usually get that question from employees. As we look at the O&M and the issues that we\u2019re dealing with to try to reduce O&M to the $2.7 billion level and beyond, we look at a lot of things; but one thing we have to be very careful about is certainly if you offer things like that, you usually lose people you don\u2019t want to lose. In this day and age certainly in our frontline employee ranks, we need every individual that\u2019s working, and there\u2019s a lot of competition going on for the professionals in those industries. That\u2019s something we have to be really careful about. Now obviously if it\u2019s part of the--as part of our regular operations that if we evaluate groups and there\u2019s efficiencies in terms of resources, whether it\u2019s vacancies or retirements or even where severance is offered, we\u2019ll continually manage our resource based upon the work that\u2019s in front of us, and we typically do that on a surgical basis rather than some generalized approach. I suspect that we\u2019ll continue that approach. Sophia Karp : Got it, thank you. One more from me, if I may. On the volumes, first, to what do you attribute the jump in oil and gas volumes? What kind of dynamic on the ground is driving that, and should we expect a reversal of that? As the states begin to sort of reopen, if you call it that, which ones of your service territories would you expect to reopen and maybe be on a faster trajectory sooner than the others [indiscernible]? Brian Tierney : What\u2019s really driving our results for oil and gas has been midstream and downstream, so I attribute a lot of that--it\u2019s pipeline transportation, really, was up 28% for the quarter. What you\u2019re seeing there is sort of a lag effect associated with all the increases that we\u2019ve seen in oil and gas extraction and then it\u2019s been moving that product from the oil patch to refineries and places where it can be used. That lag effect is finally catching up with us as we\u2019ve seen people putting in electric compression on pipelines and our having to service that, and so that trend has continued well into the first quarter and even into the month of April. We\u2019ve continued to see increases in pipeline transportation and downstream as well. The downstream might fall off a little bit as we\u2019re seeing some reductions in refining, and certainly oil and gas extraction itself will be down as people shut in wells and don\u2019t take as much as they previously had. But it\u2019s really been the midstream part of that that\u2019s been driving the growth in oil and gas that we\u2019ve seen. Nick Akins : Just to go back on your earlier question too, just an example, I probably have the opportunity for a call-out, our Conesville plant is retiring, the plant is retiring this month after over 60 years of service, and that\u2019s typically what we\u2019ve done. As plants retire, as employees shift from one plant to another and optimize across plants, we\u2019ve enabled that through severance programs and those types of things, so that\u2019s just an example of what you were mentioning before. Brian Tierney : Then to our service territories as they open, all 11 of our traditional footprint states anticipate opening in May, and they generally have staged reopenings as we go through the month, but all of ours anticipate opening during this month. Sophia Karp : Awesome, let\u2019s hope that happen. Thank you. Brian Tierney : Yes, I think our service territory, and it\u2019s really interesting to me because we serve midsized cities and smaller - Columbus, Tulsa are our largest cities, but they\u2019re obviously not New York or Chicago or other areas like that, San Francisco. That has actually improved the resilience because people are more spread out, and so our states have been able to methodically go through the shut-down provisions and now are methodically going through the restart provisions, and it\u2019s been, I would say, probably more helpful to the recovery process for our service territory. Sophia Karp : Thank you. Darcy Reese : Perky, I just want to let you know, we have time for one more question. Operator : Thank you. Our final question is from the line of Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim and Partners. Please go ahead. Shar Pourreza : Hey, good morning guys. Nick Akins : Morning Shar. Shar Pourreza : Just one or two questions, more just clarification. Nick, you obviously reiterated guidance, the long term growth rate, 5% to 7% off the original base. I know in prior remarks, you\u2019ve highlighted that you\u2019d be disappointed if you weren\u2019t in the upper end. Is that still the case, or have the issues around COVID and some of the moving pieces walked you back down a little bit from that? Nick Akins : Yes, I guess I would still be disappointed, but obviously you have to look at it realistically, and based on the information we have today, I think we\u2019re well placed in terms of that, and we\u2019ll continually update it. Obviously I\u2019d like to think there\u2019s more upside than downside because we have looked very conservatively and very pragmatically at what we face relative to the business and customer base that we serve, but as we get North Central, I\u2019m still optimistic about those future years where that gets fully layered in, starting in \u201921. So 2020 may be a tread year for the guidance range and then we get the engine back fully on the tracks and get moving again. Shar Pourreza : Got it. Then just one last on North Central, if you take the $2 billion spending around that project and you look at your $33 billion of opportunities in your base plan, as you guys look to layer in North Central spend and you\u2019re looking at different financing opportunities, is there any spending opportunities within the core $33 billion that could be maybe secondary in nature of offsetting with North Central coming online, or should we think about $2 billion from North Central additive to $33 billion? I\u2019m just trying to figure if we\u2019re modeling this, how we should think about that. Brian Tierney : And that\u2019s why we\u2019ve kept it outside. It\u2019s additive to the $33 billion. Shar Pourreza : Got it. Terrific, guys. Thanks so much for everything. Brian Tierney : Thank you Shar. Darcy Reese : Thank you for joining us on today\u2019s call. As always, the IR team will be available to answer any additional questions you may have.  Perky, will you please give the replay information? Operator : Certainly.

At this time, all lines are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given to you at that time. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, today\u2019s conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Darcy Reese. Please go ahead. Darcy Reese : Thank you, Cynthia. Good morning everyone and welcome to the second quarter 2020 earnings call for American Electric Power. We appreciate you taking the time to join us today. Our earnings release, presentation slides, and related financial information are available on our website at aep.com. Today we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors. Joining me this morning for opening remarks are Nick Akins, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Brian Tierney, our Chief Financial Officer. We will take your questions following their remarks. I will now turn the call over to Nick. Nick Akins : Okay. Thanks Darcy. And welcome, everyone to American Electric Power's second quarter 2020 earnings call. While, we continue to see the effects of COVID-19 pandemic, AEP has responded well with not only ensuring the safety of our employees and redefining the business processes to accommodate the changed environment and reducing our costs in response to lower revenues, but we also are responding to hurricane and storm activity to ensure the safe and reliable service to our customers. Our team at AEP Texas with support from internal and external resources performed well through Hurricane Hanna to restore power to over 200,000 customers during that recent weather event. And we're now supporting recovery efforts in the Northeast as well. While COVID cases were escalated in some areas, we continue to engage our employees on safe practices to prevent the virus spread both at work and outside of work to set an example in our communities. On the financial front our operating earnings performance has been strong in the face of these challenges. AEP's operating earnings came in for the quarter at $1.08 per share, bringing our year-to-date operating earnings to $2.10 per share versus $1 share for second quarter 2019 and $2.19 per share year-to-date 2019. We are reaffirming our originally stated guidance range of $4.25 to $4.45 per share and our 5% to 7% long-term growth rate. AEP is also adjusting our capital upward during the five-year capital forecast period from $33 billion to $35 billion to accommodate the North Central wind project addition. Also as we stated in the last quarter earnings call, we have continued to evaluate the short-term deferral of $500 million in our 2020 capital program that we talked about last quarter and we are placing $100 million back into the 2020 plan at this point. So all-in-all a constructive quarter given the headwinds of the economy due to COVID. In fact we continue to make progress toward our target of achieving at least the midpoint of the guidance range. As far as load is concerned, we continue to see the arbitrage between residential load and negative industrial and commercial load during the quarter. As we continue to look for leading indicators as to the health of the state economies, we have been pleased to see the new customer connections remain stable and some jurisdictions increasing from 2019 levels. Looking forward, we expect to see a continued shift to a certain degree from residential load back to commercial and industrial, albeit these shifts will be dependent upon the nature of the pandemic recovery. During the COVID-19 crisis, we continue to take all appropriate measures to ensure the safety of our employees both in the field and for those who can work-from-home. Temperature, testing masking requirements, social distancing and hygiene have become the normal course of business in this environment. While our offices are open to employee meetings and certain other activities, we are still asking our employees who can work-from-home to remain home, most likely through the end of the year. This has not slowed the progress, however, toward redefining our business processes going forward. Our Achieving Excellence Program is now back in full swing with the added dimension of work-for-home learnings that will enable us to define even more efficiencies than previously considered. We also late last year, completed an initial analysis of what a 21st century technology framework would look like, and with the addition of Therace Risch former JCPenney EVP, Chief Information Officer to our team. She has by the way hit the ground running. I'm confident the nexus of her efforts around IT and other technologies married with achieving excellence, COVID learnings, and other strategic initiatives will enable us to further define operating efficiencies that will benefit our customers and shareholders. We are on track for the $100 million of cost reductions for this year as we adjust to expectations regarding revenues due to COVID-19 and the first quarter weather deficiencies that we had. And after reviewing our July weather, we have partially made up for the weather issue that we talked about during the first quarter. So we are making progress within the guidance range expectations and we are now targeting the midpoint of our guidance. As we move closer to 2021 and the addition of North Central wind, we will still be disappointed not to be in the upper half of our 5% to 7% long-term growth rate. I would like to spend a little time taking -- talking about steps we are taking to internally consider the effects of the recent and ongoing discussions about race in America. AEP is not only engaged externally with various local and national organizations, but we were also open to very frank and open dialogue internally. We call it our cease-the-moment action plan. This plan includes engagement with our leaders and employees in the organization through internal discussions, external speakers, webcasts including myself now to be posted internally and process changes that will continue to make AEP a strong committed company that enables all of our employees to contribute in an open and transparent fashion. We have a great culture at this company, but we can always do better by understanding the impacts of stereotypes different perspectives based upon life experiences, the burden placed on employees of color in our organization and what systemic racism versus individual racism act actually means. I believe the dialogue will enable a much deeper discussion that will benefit our diversity and inclusion efforts as well as enable AEP to be a better partner to our communities, as we effectuate lasting change. We can't talk about these cultural attributes without also realizing what our brand projects externally. And that brings me to the second issue that we at AEP certainly believe affects our brand. That would be the issue surrounding Ohio House Bill six legislation. Let me start by saying that we are not aware of any information suggesting that AEP's participation in the process was anything other than lawful and ethical. We have a robust code of ethics and regularly communicate our expectations to our employees that they conduct all business including advocacy on public policy issues with integrity, honesty and in compliance with the law. We consistently advocate for policy positions that benefit our customer's, communities and shareholders and our advocacy of HB6 was no different. We ultimately supported the legislation because we believe it maintained important fuel diversity for Ohio including support for investments in renewables, nuclear generation and two coal plants operated by OVEC. We were surprised and disappointed to learn of what federal investigators alleged was a scheme by the speaker of the Ohio House and others to enrich themselves. And we along with you have been trying to educate ourselves about the criminal complaint and the underlying conduct in it. There has been a lot of speculation and media reports about the identity of various unnamed companies described in the affidavit in support of the complaint. Based on the facts that we know, we do not believe that AEP is any of the companies specifically described in the affidavit. We have not been contacted by any authorities conducting the investigation. If at any point we are, we will cooperate fully. I would also like to discuss 501(c)(4) organizations more generally. AEP has contributed to a variety of 501(c)(4) social welfare organizations to promote economic development and educational programs across our service territories. One such organization is Empowering Ohio's Economy, which was organized to promote economic and business development in Ohio. Starting in 2015, AEP contributed a total of $8.7 million to Empowering Ohio's Economy for review of publicly available tax forms filed by Empowering Ohio's Economy shows that it made a number of grants over time to a wide variety of charitable organizations under 501(c)(3) and social welfare organizations under 501(c)(4). Our contributions to Empowering Ohio's Economy to support its mission were appropriate and lawful. Given the ongoing legal proceedings surrounding HB6 that we are still learning about and that we are unaware of any allegations of wrongdoing involving AEP, I'm going to let those proceedings play out rather than commenting further on this subject. We also understand the concerns that some have expressed regarding the lack of transparency surrounding 501(c)(4) organizations which are not required to disclose their donors and amounts donated to them. With that in mind, we will commit to include additional disclosures in our corporate accountability report with respect to contributions that we made to 501(c)(4) organizations in 2020 and going forward. We also are reviewing best practices and working to improve our policies and processes around political contributions and contributions to 501(c)(4) entities. Regarding any repeal and replacement of HB6, we are fully prepared as we have done previously to engage in whatever dialogue needs to occur to chart a path in Ohio toward a balanced energy portfolio that moves toward a clean energy future for Ohio. AEP has been very clear since the beginning of a nuclear debate that we were concerned about forging a path toward the adoption of renewables, such as solar and wind along with other technologies, such as storage to mobile technologies, the big data analytics to enable a smarter and more efficient grid. HB6 has some of that, but we were also following HB247 to move Ohio forward from a clean energy technology perspective. If HB6 is repealed in a way that appropriately reverses its effects, the financial impact is minimal to AEP. We already had several years of recovery for the OVEC units HB6 elongated that. We will continue to recover our energy efficiency contracts entered into before the legislation. AEP Ohio is already decoupled in many respects. And we will continue to pursue bilateral solar and wind projects with customers. As we have said since day one, if our customers are expected to help put the bill for nuclear, they should also have the opportunity to take full benefit of renewables and movement to a clean energy economy and be able to access technologies that will help them to lower their electric bills. Unrelated to HB6, but an item that should not be lost in the Ohio legislature is continued interest in promoting greater broadband access particularly in rural Ohio. This is an area that we are well positioned to help stimulate by providing middle-mile services to ISPs to advance the service for those communities. We are optimistic that the broadband legislation that passed the House with broad support continues forward as the pandemic has shown the digital divide is real and getting more pronounced and the need for broadband access for our customers particularly rural customers is desperately needed and we can leverage into our communication system to make broadband access a reality. We have already begun pilots in Virginia and West Virginia. And certainly with our large amounts of -- need for large amounts of data from the grid for monitoring and analysis purposes tangentially providing mid-mile broadband accessibility is clearly a benefit to our communities. On the regulatory front our base rate case in Ohio was filed earlier this year where we're seeking a net revenue increase of $41 million a 10.15% ROE and continuation of our DOE and Enhanced Service Reliability Rider. We expect a procedural schedule to be set next month. In Kentucky, we filed our base rate case in July which should conclude by year-end. We have sought $65 million with a 10% ROE as well as AMI deployment within the state. We sought to be creative in our use of ADFIT funds to help lessen the rate impacts to customers in the state. I am pleased to report that the Texas Commission approved the AEP Texas DCRF settlement agreement increasing revenue requirement by approximately $39 million which reflects the $440 million of distribution investment placed in service in 2019. Throughout our territory new customer interconnects continue to be strong in much of our service territory in several areas exceeding what we have seen in recent years. While the virus continues to challenge this nation this provides hope in American commitment and ingenuity will continue to help fuel our recovery. Lastly we are extremely pleased to have now received all necessary regulatory approvals to move the full North Central wind investment forward for the benefit of our customers. Although the disappointing PUCT denial of our application results in the project benefits not extending to our Texas customers, we received approvals from the Arkansas Public Service Commission and the Louisiana Public Service Commission in May for their portion and the flex-up option. Approval of flex-up option was designed to enable the full value of the project to go forward even if the state elected not to take advantage of the opportunity. We are pleased that the Arkansas Public Service Commission and the Louisiana Public Service Commission along with the Oklahoma Corporation Commission have recognized the value of these projects. And we look forward to delivering this value to Arkansas, Louisiana and Oklahoma customers. With regards to the project schedule due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we expect a minimal delay in the completion of the 199-megawatt Sundance Project and expect the project to be delivered in the first quarter of 2021 instead of December 2020. The other two projects are currently expected to be delivered by the developer by the end of '21 -- 2021. We are pleased to report in May the RAS provided an extra year to the 4-year continuity safe harbor related to production tax credit eligibility. So we have an additional year of flexibility should there be any delays to deliver these projects and achieve full value for our customers. Now looking at the equalizer graph on Page five of the presentation, our overall regulated operations ROE is currently 9.1%. We like to target a range overall of 9.5% to 10%. So I'll go into some other things around weather and the other things that have come into play. AEP Ohio, the ROE for AEP Ohio at the end of the second quarter was 11.1%. Their ROE was above authorized due to favorable regulatory items and a transmission true-up partially offset by the roll-off of legacy fuel and capacity carrying charge recoveries. We expect the year-end ROE to trend around authorized levels of 10% as we maintain concurrent capital recovery of distribution and transmission investment. In June 2020 as I said earlier, we filed a rate case in Ohio. As far as APCo is concerned the end of the second quarter was 9.3% ROE. That ROE was below authorized due to lower normalized usage and higher depreciation from increased capital investments. Virginia's first tri-annual review was filed in March 2020 and covers the 2017 to 2019 periods and that case is currently ongoing. At Kentucky Power the ROE is down to 5.7%. It was below authorized due to loss of load from weak economic conditions and loss of major customers along with higher expenses. Transmission revenues were also lowered due to the delay of some capital projects. In June 2020 Kentucky Power filed a new base rate case seeking a $65 million revenue increase and an ROE of 10%. I&M came in at 10.6% for the quarter. The ROE was above authorized due to continued management of O&M expenses reduced interest expense and rate true-ups partially offset by lower normalized usage. I&M's ROE is projected to trend towards 10% at year-end consistent with authorized ROEs. PSO came in at 9.4% for the quarter. Their ROE is right in line with the authorized level due to management of O&M expenses offset by lower normalization usage. PSO's 2019 base case approved a transmission tracker, a partial distribution tracker, and an ROE of 9.4%. So, everything is going well there. SWEPCO came in at 8.3%. And again it's below authorized due to loss of load and the continued impact of the Arkansas share of the Turk Plant which accounts for about 110 basis points. SWEPCO received an order in its Arkansas-based settlement in December 2019, that's effective in January 2020 approving a $24 million increase and an ROE of 9.45%. AEP Texas came in the quarter at 7.4%, their ROE was below authorized due to lag associated with the timing. We've discussed this earlier last quarter of the annual cost recovery filings and one-time adjustments from our recently finalized base rate case. Favorable regulatory treatment allows AEP Texas to file annual DCRF and biannual TCOS filings to recover costs on significant capital investments. So, while earnings should improve in 2020 with the base rate case finalized the annual filings now resumed continued levels of investment in Texas will continue to impact the ROE as well. AEP Transmission came in at 9.8%. It was below authorized primarily driven by the annual revenue true-up in the second quarter of 2020 and to return the over-collection of 2019 revenues. Transmission is forecasting an ROE of in the range of 9.9% to 10.3% for 2020. So, that should continue on as the year goes forward. As I've mentioned in the past, our organization has undertaken a comprehensive view of our O&M and capital spending efficiency under a program that we coined Achieving Excellence. I'm excited about this opportunity for our employees because it goes to the heart of how we do work, removing past barriers that may have existed, and looking at our processes through a different lens. We are now moving into the implementation phase of this initiative with opportunities for increased O&M savings and increased efficiencies in our capital spending being implemented over the next three years and beyond. This work will serve as the platform and help to integrate other initiatives around organizational design, digitization, end-to-end process efficiency, and work-from-home initiatives. The program will also be a precursor to our annual budgeting process in the future. We will share more information about these initiatives and the expected O&M savings later this year, but we have recently jump-started this initiative by offering an early retirement incentive program for a targeted set of our employees. The program has recently closed and I'm pleased to say that we have reached our goals of this initiative where about 200 of our employees have selected to take this incentive to retire. I'm thankful to those who will be leaving the company soon for many reasons. One, for their years of service and dedication to AEP and for providing the company an opportunity to take advantage of organizational design changes upon their exit. I'll be providing more detail when we wrap up all these initiatives later this fall. Before I turn this over to Brian, particularly, with the headwinds we all face today, I'd like to paraphrase some of the lyrics from the song Lost in the Echo by the rock group Linkin Park that I think represents AEP today. Now, it may take a little time for you to figure out what I'm saying here. But nevertheless the lyrics say; we don't hold back we hold our own, we can't be mapped we can't be cloned, we can't C-flat, it ain't our tone. What you get from AEP is our consistent focus on being a positive tone attitude and performance that will help our communities and customers get through this pandemic and the culture issues that's scarring our society. We will continue to be uniquely qualified to bring stakeholders together to move toward a clean energy future for our customers and again provide the quality dividends and earnings that our shareholders expect. Brian, I'll turn it over to you. Brian Tierney : Thank you, Nick and good morning everyone. I will take us through the second quarter and year-to-date financial results, provide an update on how we were thinking about 2020, including a look at July load, and finish with the review of our balance sheet and liquidity. Let's stop briefly on slide six which shows the comparison of GAAP to operating earnings for the quarter and year-to-date periods. GAAP earnings for the second quarter were $1.05 per share compared to $0.93 per share in 2019. GAAP earnings through June were $2.05 per share compared to $2.10 per share in 2019. There is a reconciliation of GAAP to operating earnings on pages 15 and 16 of the appendix. Let's turn to slide seven and look at the drivers of quarterly operating earnings by segment. Operating earnings for the second quarter were $1.08 per share or $534 million compared to $1 per share or $494 million in 2019. Operating earnings for Vertically Integrated Utilities were $0.55 per share, up $0.17, driven by lower O&M and higher transmission revenue primarily due to true-ups. Normalized retail load was favorable due to higher-margin residential sales more than offsetting significant decreases in industrial and commercial sales. We will talk more -- in more detail about our expectations around normalized load for the year later in the presentation. Other favorable items included weather and rate changes. These positive items were partially offset by higher depreciation and other taxes and lower wholesale load AFUDC and off-system sales. The transmission and distribution utility segment earned $0.29 per share, up $0.02 from last year. Both O&M and transmission revenue were favorable due to the impact of the transmission true-up on this segment. Increased transmission investment in ERCOT was positive as well. Rate changes were also favorable and partially offset by prior-year Texas carrying charges, the roll-off of legacy riders in Ohio, depreciation, lower normalized retail load and higher interest expense. The Transmission Holdco segment contributed $0.19 per share, down $0.12 due to the impacts of the annual true-up and a prior year FERC settlement. Our fundamental return on investment growth continued as net plant increased by $1.5 billion, or 17% since June of last year. Generation & Marketing produced operating earnings of $0.11 per share, up $0.05 from last year. Again on the sale of Conesville and land sales contributed to the increase in generation business and the renewables business grew with the acquisition of multiple renewable assets. These increases along with the timing around income taxes more than offset lower retail margins. Finally, Corporate and Other was down $0.04 per share primarily driven by higher taxes related to consolidating items that were reversed by the year-end and partially offset by lower O&M. Let's turn to slide 8 and review our year-to-date results. Operating earnings through June were $2.10 per share or $1 billion, compared to $2.19 per share or $1.1 billion in 2019. Looking at the drivers by segment. Operating earnings for Vertically Integrated Utilities were $1.05 per share, up $0.04. Earnings in this segment increased due to lower O&M and higher transmission revenue similar to the quarter as well as the impact of rate changes across multiple jurisdictions. Weather was unfavorable, primarily due to warmer than normal winter temperatures. Other decreases included higher depreciation, tax expenses and lower expected wholesale load, AFUDC, normalized retail load and off-system sales. The Transmission & Distribution Utilities segment earned $0.53 per share, down $0.05 from last year, primarily driven by a reversal of a regulatory provision in Ohio. Other smaller drivers, included higher depreciation, the roll-off of legacy riders in Ohio, prior-year Texas carrying charges, higher interest expense and unfavorable weather. These items were partially offset by higher rate changes, the Ohio transmission true-up impact on both O&M and transmission revenue and recovery of increased transmission investment in ERCOT. The AEP Transmission Holdco segment contributed $0.47 per share, down $0.10 from last year for the same reasons identified in the quarterly comparison. Generation & Marketing produced $0.18 per share, up $0.04 from last year. The growth in the renewables business and gains on generation more than offset the lower retail margins and timing around income taxes. Finally, Corporate and Other was down $0.02 per share due to higher interest expense and taxes related to consolidating items that will reverse by the year-end and offset by a prior year income tax adjustment. Partially offsetting these items is lower O&M. Turning to slide 9. Let's review the assumptions we shared during the first quarter earnings call. To reaffirm our 2020 operating earnings guidance range of $4.25 per share to $4.45 per share. As shown on the top line, we revised our retail sales projection from 1.5% growth in 2020 to a 3.4% decline by the end of the year. For the second quarter, our sales growth in total was on target with the revised projections. The mix of sales growth is slightly different than projected, but the date load is closely tracking to the revised forecast. The second item was the impact of weather. While the first quarter weather produced a significant drag, the second quarter weather was slightly favorable. In addition, we experienced warmer than normal weather in July, especially in the East. As a result, we are now assuming less of a negative impact to our 2020 results from weather. The third item was managing our untracked O&M expense. We had originally planned to drive down O&M costs in 2020 to $2.8 billion from $3.1 billion in 2019. During the first quarter call, we shared that in response to the expected decline in sales we now plan to reduce spend by an additional $100 million by aggressively managing O&M. We are on track to hit our projections through both one-time and sustainable reductions. Finally, on the first quarter call, we identified approximately $500 million of capital expenditures that could be shifted out of 2020 and into future years. This was in anticipation of the potential impact of the economic downturn on cash receipts. Through the second quarter, our day's sales outstanding have only marginally increased. We have brought about $100 million of the $500 million back into 2020 and we'll maintain flexibility as we move through the balance of the year. Given the progress made on these key assumptions in the second quarter, we are able to reaffirm our 2020 operating earnings guidance range. There are main items that could positively or negatively impact our projections for the second half of the year, but we are confident in our ability to manage our way through various scenarios. Now let's turn to slide 10 to provide an update on our normalized load for the quarter. Starting in the lower right corner, our second quarter normalized load was down 5.9%. This was consistent with the expectations we shared with you in the first quarter. We anticipated a significant contraction in the second quarter followed by a gradual recovery over the second half of the year. Through June, our normalized sales were down 3.1%. In the upper left quadrant, our normalized residential sales increased by 6.2% in the second quarter. Year-to-date residential sales were up 1.9% compared to last year. We saw significant increases in our residential load during the stay-at-home provisions that were in effect during the quarter. Even after our states began their phased reopenings, we saw strong growth in weather-normalized residential sales across all jurisdictions. This would suggest many of our customers have continued to work from home. We expect the spike in residential growth to moderate as the commercial and industrial sectors improve during the second half of the year. Moving clockwise, our normalized commercial sales decreased by 10.1% in the second quarter bringing the year-to-date decline to 5%. Prior to COVID, we had experienced consistent improvement in our commercial sales over the past year. State and post stay-at-home provisions challenged many of our commercial customers. All of our leading sectors experienced a drop in normalized load in the quarter with the biggest declines coming in schools, churches, restaurants and hotels. Should our states manage without having to shut down businesses again, we expect commercial sales to gradually improve throughout the balance of the year. Finally in the lower left chart, industrial sales decreased by 12.4% in the quarter bringing the year-to-date decline to 6.6%. A number of factors have changed the outlook for this class but the biggest driver is the overall drop in economic activity. The industrial sales \u2013 the industrial sectors that posted the biggest decline for the quarter were transportation, equipment, manufacturing, mining and primary metals. The two sectors that have grown in 2020 were pipeline transportation and petroleum and coal products. Let's take a look at weather-normalized load history and forecast in more detail on Slide 11. The chart on the left shows that for the second quarter actual load very closely tracked our revised forecast. As you can see from the chart, our revised forecast assumed an economic trough in the second quarter that would gradually improve over the course of the year. So far we are on track and we'll keep you updated as we move throughout the year. We wanted the time this call in order to give you the most updated load information through July. The chart on the upper right shows monthly total weather-normalized sales for March through July. Sales for our system were lowest in May and have shown improvement in June and July. Total normalized load for May was down 8.6% versus June, which was down 4.8% versus July, which was down only 2.4%. The monthly macro data for both the business and household surveys show that unemployment rates peaked in April and have improved since. This is consistent with our assumption that the trough is behind us and the economy should continue its gradual improvement through the balance of the year. The bottom right chart shows that for the month of July, the trend that we forecast for the balance of the year is on track. Although there are some differences in load mix to what we have predicted, our overall load is tracking very closely to our revised forecast. Normalized residential sales for July while still very positive at 4.3% were less than for the second quarter. And both commercial and industrial sales show real improvement versus the second quarter as shown on the prior page. Now let's move to Slide 12 and review the company's capitalization and liquidity. Our debt to total capital \u2013 our debt-to-capitalization ratio improved 70 basis points in the second quarter to 61.1%. This was largely attributable to reducing our short-term debt levels in conjunction with fortifying our liquidity position, as we navigated the capital market turbulence in March. In fact, our liquidity position stood strong at $2.9 billion at quarter end. The short-term reduction actions also helped improve our FFO-to-debt ratio when compared to the first quarter moving to 14.1% from 12.5% on a Moody's basis. Our Qualified Pension Funding remained flat at 93% and our OPEB Funding increased approximately 5% to 135%. A falling discount rate increased both plans liabilities during the quarter but strong asset returns especially in equities were able to offset the growth in liabilities. Let's wrap this up on Slide 13 so we can get to your questions. We are reaffirming our existing 2000 operating earnings guidance of $4.25 to $4.45 per share. We are on track to reduce our O&M by the additional $100 million we announced last quarter in response to the economic downturn and revised load implications. Of the $500 million of CapEx that we shifted out of 2020 into later years, we have now returned $100 million into this year. We will maintain our flexibility on this issue as we manage through the balance of the year. We obtained regulatory approvals in Oklahoma, Louisiana, Arkansas and FERC and are moving forward with our $2 billion North Central wind project in Oklahoma, benefiting our customers in PSO and SWEPCO. We have updated our capital plan from 33 \u2013 our five-year capital plan from $33 billion to $35 billion as well as our cash flow and credit metrics which are provided on Page 40 of the appendix. Because of our ability to continue to invest in our own system organically we are reaffirming our stated long-term growth rate of 5% to 7%. With that I will turn the call over to the operator for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from the line of Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. And your line is open. Nick Akins : Good morning, Jeremy. Jeremy Tonet : Hi. Good morning. Nick Akins : Good morning. Jeremy Tonet : Hi. Thanks for taking my questions here. I wanted to start-off a couple of, I guess, opposing items influencing AEP going forward here North Central wind getting that over the finish line, obviously, a big positive COVID headwind on the other side here. Just wondering, if you could talk a bit more about how these two factors influence I guess your 5% to 7% range with North Central wind? I think we're just looking to see if that could really help you here, or just want to see how everything is shaking out I guess going forward? Nick Akins : Yes. So I mean we look at -- and as Brian mentioned on the COVID activity and the load activity, you're seeing residential load be pretty strong. And certainly as you look forward I think residential load is going to continue to look strong with the work-from-home environment and the business cases that are developed afterwards. And then if you have Commercial and Industrial pickup as well, it could be positive from a financial standpoint. The other regarding North Central and other wind projects and solar projects, we have a real opportunity to transition to that clean energy economy going forward in our service territory and that will really makes us \u2013 again, we would be disappointed not to be in the upper part -- upper half of the 5% to 7% range because you have to be bullish about not only where load is going, but also in terms of the transformation from a -- just a pure and simple energy policy perspective regardless of who's in the White House in the next election, we'll continue moving toward a clean energy economy. And then also I think, bolstered by the other opportunities we have whether it's mid-range broadband or other types of activities electric vehicles and so forth that we're going to see the further electrification of this society. So I'm really bullish about this company in particular, but as well the industry. Jeremy Tonet : That makes sense. That's helpful. Thanks. And maybe just kind of building off that with my second question. I think AEP is guiding to $1.3 billion of equity issuance to fund North Central at this point. Just wondering, if you could update us there on your thoughts with regard to is this definitively the path, or is there the potential for portfolio optimization? Is that still an option? I guess, how do you think about... Brian Tierney : It absolutely is still an option. And we're looking at all those options to see how to best finance it. We have plenty of time to make those things happen. Nick said that Sundance might be pushed out to the first quarter of 2021, but we're not going to see the rest of those projects coming in Traverse and Maverick until the end of 2021. So all those things are in play whether it's equity or rotation of capital. But for planning purposes we are guiding people to two-thirds equity for that project in aggregate. Jeremy Tonet : Got you. That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. Nick Akins : Thanks, Jeremy. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Weisel with Scotiabank. And your line is open. Nick Akins : Good morning, Andrew. Andrew Weisel : Good morning. First a question on dividends. So at the end of the deck you showed dividends in 2022 at $1.5 billion versus $1.4 billion previously. I also see the footnote that dividend should grow with earnings. My question is, is that increase of $100 million a function of more shares outstanding after the North Central wind equity, or does it imply a step-up in dividend per share along with a step-up in EPS or perhaps both? Nick Akins : I think it'd be some of both because obviously with North Central additional equity involved there, but also as you said I mean our dividend will move with our earnings capability. So I'd say both. Andrew Weisel : Okay. Great. Nick Akins : Brian, do you have any comments? Okay. Andrew Weisel : Go ahead. Nick Akins : No, I was just seeing if Brian wanted to just comment on that but he said I covered it. Andrew Weisel : Okay. Great. On CapEx you mentioned that you're pulling back $100 million of the deferred CapEx. I just want to understand -- be sure I understand what drove that. Is that a function of specific projects being more necessary or more appealing, or is it more a function of the better-than-expected cash flows? Nick Akins : Yes, I think that's a positive story. Some of that is related to new customer connections. And so it was clearly evident that we needed to move that forward. But also we have the capability financially to move it forward. We talked about this last time the deferral of the $500 million we weren't changing the five-year capital plan we were going to maintain that level. And the $500 million was merely being deferred so that we could understand what the COVID issues were going to be. And so we're continually looking at our process going forward in terms of putting that 500 back in in various stages. So what you saw this quarter was the first stage of that. Andrew Weisel : Very good. If I could just have one more here to clarify the last question from Jeremy. The 5% to 7% range you're pointing to the upper end of that. Is that a function of North Central wind now being included, or is it more that you're pointing to the higher end with or without North Central wind as a one-timer? Nick Akins : Well, certainly, we looked at North Central, but obviously, we continue to track and we believe that the upper half of that guidance range is certainly achievable and something that we again would be disappointed not to be able to get there. So that's clearly an opportunity for us based on the things that I talked about earlier. Brian Tierney : It should \u2013 North Central wind should certainly solidify our position in the upper half. Nick Akins : Yeah. And keep in mind too at the same time the Achieving Excellence Progam is continuing to grow. So we already have plans in place and you're seeing sort of a crescendo of savings associated with that plan. And the first year 2020 is \u2013 some of it's in there, but not much. And when you look at the future years that continues to grow substantially, and certainly, as I've mentioned earlier the addition of Therace and the focus on digitization automation in combination with the learnings from COVID, I think going to further accentuate the benefits from achieving excellence. Andrew Weisel : That all sounds great. Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of James Thalacker with BMO Capital Markets. And your line is open. Nick Akins : Good morning, James. James Thalacker : Hey, good morning, guys. Can you hear me? Nick Akins : Yep, I'm hearing you yes. Good morning. James Thalacker : Okay. Great. Real quick question. I know you had outlined the bending the cost curve EEI down to kind of $2.8 billion. And as COVID took over we're now down at $2.7 billion. It seems like year-to-date if you just look at it on an after-tax basis you guys are already kind of running above that kind of $100 million sort of run rate. How should, we I guess think about the non-tracked O&M versus the additional O&M that you are actually pulling out in response to COVID? And as we think about 2021, is there any guidance, I guess you could give us on how much of that you think will be retainable as we move into next year? Brian Tierney : Yeah. So we're at this point James not able to provide obviously specific guidance on 2021. But I'll say, the incremental $100 million that we're able to garner is a combination of sustainable and one-timers. And I think it's a matter of managing our way through the downturn in normalized load and just working as hard as we can to pull out all the stops to make sure that we meet our commitments to shareholders and really target the middle part of that range without impacting customers. And so far, we've been able to do that. There have been some unexpected things that we've seen maybe some things that aren't line items in O&M that have come out. And I think you have things like travel and expense conventions that people go to things like that meals just buildings expense that you have things that just don't happen when everyone's working from home that, I think are more like one-timers but if people go back to work we'll start to put those things back into place. But you've seen our track record over the last nine or 10 years now and it's been keeping a very, very tight range on untracked O&M and we're using those skills that we've learned over the last several years to make sure that we're able to manage our way through this circumstance. Nick Akins : Yeah, I would say, and as Brian mentioned I mean, there's a lot of learnings from COVID-19 and the impacts and how we've operated, and the efficiency of which we've operated. And I think it sort of changes, the perspective and changes the threshold of even, what one-timers are and ongoing, because I think the learnings we have from here we're going to be much different in our approach related to many of these activities. And actually, you would be surprised and I'll certainly talk about this more at the end of the year of what achieving excellence is showing us of things that were buried in the organization that we obviously have an opportunity to take advantage of. And so there's no question that you should expect the continued efficiency around the savings of O&M. And that's in the non-tracked area. Brian Tierney : You've seen \u2013 on page 34 of the presentation, you've seen the tight range we've been able to keep it in. In terms of bending the curve as we go down to $2.7 billion in non-track, we actually are bending that curve downward at this point. Nick Akins : Yes. Bending to warping. So that's good. James Thalacker : No, that's great. And I guess just as a follow-up, I mean, obviously the run rate has been very, very good. I mean, you did a heroic job, I guess in 2Q just the bulk of it from a year-to-date perspective that's kind of showed up. But as you move through the rest of the year do you feel like you have additional room whether it be onetime or again Nick like you're talking about through just kind of change in workflow to continue to sort of press that down, if you need to if we get sort of resurgence in COVID again? Nick Akins : Yeah. I think number one really, I think about \u2013 the processes are in place and the focus of the organization is in place to be able to adjust. And I'm perfectly happy with the foundation that's been put in place for this organization on an ongoing basis. I mean, because if we look at our Achieving Excellence Program, it's not just a onetime program. It's a regular process we're going to go through in budgeting. And it's also a regular process, where they'll go throughout the year, for us to be able to adjust. So we will do what we have to do. And there's no question, that we have the foundation to be able to do it. James Thalacker : Okay. Great. Nick Akins : Yeah. James Thalacker : Well, thank you for taking my question. And best of luck guys. Nick Akins : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next we will go to the line of Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. And your line is open. Durgesh Chopra : Good morning, Nick. Nick Akins : Hey good morning. Durgesh Chopra : Oh! That is down. Hello? Hey can you hear me? Nick Akins : Yeah. Go ahead. Durgesh Chopra : Okay. Great, just -- I wanted to follow-up on the O&M $100 million number. What of that $100 million was actually achieved in the quarter? Brian Tierney : It will be the O&M CapEx or the O&M -- I'm sorry O&M caps. It's going to be achieved rateably throughout the balance of the year. So from second quarter, third and fourth, think about it being achieved rateably, as we work our way through that. Durgesh Chopra : Understood and I apologize there's like an echo in my -- when I'm speaking. So -- and then, the potential labor initiatives that you outlined is that in addition to the $100 million? Brian Tierney : It's all incorporated to get us to that $2.7 billion number. Durgesh Chopra : Understood guys. Thank you so much. Brian Tierney : Sure. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sophie Karp with KeyBanc. And your line is open. Brian Tierney : Good morning, Sophie. Sophie Karp : Hi good morning guys. Good morning. Congrats on the quarter. Nick Akins : Thanks. Sophie Karp : And thanks for the time. I'm just curious about -- maybe I can ask you, more of a high-level question. Given the landscape or market landscape that we are seeing right now. Do you see an opportunity maybe an opening to do some rotation in your portfolio of assets maybe high-graded a little bit if you will and divest some? And is there an opportunity for M&A for a more wires focused or like just asset [Technical Difficulty] \u2026 Nick Akins : Yeah, Sophie. Sophie Karp : \u2026your puts and thoughts on that. Nick Akins : Yeah, sure, we've certainly been consistent in the discussion around any M&A activity or in terms of -- what we can do in terms of rotation. That's always an option that's available to us. And this company is moving toward, a portfolio management approach where obviously we have sources and uses and those sources include the assets we have. And certainly we'll continue to look at those, as opportunities in time with investments that we make. So we will continue to do that. Regarding M&A activity we have a high threshold because we certainly have the ability to invest we have the ability to -- we have the largest transmission system in the country. Certainly our investment in our distribution businesses is continuing to grow considerably. And so, if we can invest that out without a premium, that's a good thing for our shareholders. Now that being said, we look at strategic areas that make sense to us but certainly that threshold is high. And we'll continue to evaluate that. But make no mistake that this company is focused on its ability to continue to grow, but grow efficiently for our shareholders. And we'll continue to do that. Sophie Karp : Thank you. Nick Akins : Yeah. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. And your line is open. Nick Akins : Good morning, Paul. Paul Patterson : Hey how are you doing? Nick Akins : All right, how are you? Paul Patterson : I am managing. No laugh. So I can do like that. And so, I don't think of you guys, being a primary beneficiary or primarily impacted by HB6, but is there any ancillary or anything we should think about with the potential repeal of HB6 in Ohio, that could impact you guys? Nick Akins : Well, certainly with the repeal, it's -- how it's replaced is the issue, and obviously how it's repealed. Because there are some things some interconnections that occurred between HB6 and the regulatory process, where we had regulatory recovery for areas that we need to make sure that's a clean transition that occurs. But on its face, the issues that were involved with that for us should be pretty well taken care of. So that's why we're saying it should be a minimal issue for us. I think it's more of an opportunity for us, because if we're able to -- and really if the state focuses on the clean energy economy going forward, that's going to provide us some opportunities to really do this the right way including nuclear for the -- for our customers going forward. Paul Patterson : But if it's not replaced, just because we don't know what's going to happen legislatively and who knows, how should we think about the potential impact? Nick Akins : Yeah. So, if it's not replaced, then it stays the way it is then we should be fine, because there are already... Paul Patterson : I mean, it's repealed and they don't -- they repeal it and they don't replace it if you file... Nick Akins : Okay, okay good. Brian? Brian Tierney : So, we'll be fine in that circumstance, Paul. We already had decoupling in place for residential and small commercial customers. We were already getting recovery of OVEC through 2024 through the regulatory process rather than 2030, and it allowed us to enter into bilateral contracts with customers, but we haven't signed any bilaterals to date. So, we think will be absolutely fine, if it's repealed and not replaced. But as Nick said, I think there are opportunities to do it right and replace it with something that's more positive. Nick Akins : Yes, we've done bilateral contracts just not with that structure. So\u2026 Paul Patterson : Okay, great. And then just on the PJM 205, end-of-life transmission planning filing. I know you guys are protesting that with almost every other transmission company. Do you have any sense as to what the potential impact would be from a shareholder perspective on transmission CapEx or anything else, if that 205 filing is accepted by FERC? Brian Tierney : Paul, we think it would be pretty minimal to us. Nick Akins : Yeah. Paul Patterson : Okay. Good. Awesome, thanks so much. Brian Tierney : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And at this time, I'm showing no other questions in queue. Please go ahead with any closing remarks. Darcy Reese : Thank you for joining us on today's call. As always, the IR team will be available to answer any additional questions you may have. Cynthia, would you please give the replay information. Operator : Certainly. Ladies and gentlemen, today's conference call will be available for replay after 5 :30 p.m. today and going until August 14 at 3 :55 p.m. You may access the AT&T teleconference replay system by dialing 866-207-1041 and entering the access code of 7269937.

At this time, all the participant lines are in a listen-only mode. However there will be an opportunity for your questions [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded. I'll turn the call now over to the Managing Director of Investor Relations, Ms. Darcy Reese. Please go ahead. Darcy Reese : Thank you, John. Good morning everyone, and welcome to the third quarter 2020 earnings call for American Electric Power. We appreciate you taking the time to join us today. Our earnings release, presentation slides, and related financial information are available on our website at aep.com. Today, we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors. Joining me this morning for opening remarks are Nick Akins, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Brian Tierney, our Chief Financial Officer. We will take your questions following their remarks. I will now turn the call over to Nick. Nick Akins : Okay. Thanks, Darcy, and welcome, everyone to American Electric Power's third quarter 2020 earnings call. The third quarter has been another strong quarter for AEP. Despite the continued challenges of COVID-19 and its effects on the economy, we continue to be optimistic about our ability to execute and provide the consistent quality of earnings and dividend growth, our shareholders expect, and provide focus on our customers and communities we serve to get past the multiple challenges, we face as a result of the pandemic. I know many of us have had the feeling during 2020 with these multiple challenges that Lenny Kravitz sang about in a song Flyaway singing, Oh, I want to get away, I want to fly away, yeah, yeah, yeah, probably figuratively and literally. But there is light at the end of the tunnel. As we move through this memorable year, AEP continues to drive firmly within the guidance range with targeting the midpoint, as we move to the last quarter. We're accomplishing this by executing on cost control in response to the pandemic, keeping our employees safe through the crisis by taking all the extra precautions, and working with our customers to alleviate the economic pressures during this time. We are also learning a lot during this crisis, the value of efficient work from home environments, the focus on capital and OEM management, the acceleration of our achieving excellence program, and the focus on social issues that drive a cultural brand that brings everyone into the journey of being the premier regulated utility AEP strives to be. In fact, AEP just made the Forbes JUST Capital 100 list for 2021 being the highest ranked utility on the list. We have also been involved with two major storm events, Hurricanes Laura and Delta, and SWEPCO in Louisiana territory. I'm proud of how our employees stepped up during these major weather events in the midst of COVID-19 protocols, to effectively and efficiently return service to our customers in a safe manner, just as they do every day to keep the lights on. And now it's even the more important service during work from home and stay at home environments. Financially, our operating performance continues to be strong in the face of these challenges. AEPs operating earnings for the quarter came in at $1.47 per share versus dollar $1.46 per share last year, bringing us to a $3.56 per share for year-to-date 2020, versus $3.65 per share last year this time. We continue to be firmly within the stated 2020 guidance range of $4.25 to $4.45, and we continue to be optimistic regarding our progress going into 2021. We are reaffirming our current guidance range and our long-term 5% to 7% growth rate. And as I have said previously, I would be disappointed not to be in the upper half of that 5% to 7% range. Our board just approved the dividend increase of approximately 6% in line with our earnings, in the middle of our targeted payout ratio of 60% to 70%, and consistent with our long-term growth rate of 5% to 7%. An incredible accomplishment given the headwinds we expect we are facing in the first quarter and the second quarter of this year. Even with this success in turbulent times, we are not out of the woods yet, but we are seeing improvement in industrial and residential load. However, commercial loads such as churches, restaurants, hotels and schools, not surprisingly, are still challenged. Brian, will get into more detail on the economy later. We could not have achieved the outcome today AEP has achieved thus far during the year, without our employees attention and cutting our costs to compensate for losses from the COVID economy. Our achieving excellence program is going very well and not only has it helped us compensate for the revenue losses due to the pandemic, but it set an excellent catalyst for the future in terms of continued O&M cost control. More to come on this at November EEI. Most economists believe the 2021 economy will improve. And while we are seeing positive progress going in the fourth quarter, industrial and commercial progress has slowed, perhaps until after the election cycle or during the second wave of the COVID cases or during the dependency of upcoming therapeutics and vaccines. With all of that said, it has been a very productive quarter and we expect improvement to continue into 2021. We continue to adhere to COVID pandemic-related protocols of temperature testing, mask requirements, social distancing and hygiene-related activities. Our confirmed cases are increasing with the apparent second wave, and we are doubling down on messaging around practicing safeguards outside of the work environment as much as inside. Thankfully, we have not lost anyone due to the virus, but vigilance and fighting complacency is key here. We also have continued our outreach to employees and the communities we serve regarding racial injustice. As I mentioned last quarter, our Seize the Moment initiative is important to reach a deeper understanding of the racial divides that exist, and gain perspective from one another about actionable next steps. Before I get to the regulatory updates, I'll just head this off at the past questions about HB6 in Ohio. I'll just say flatly that we have nothing new to report from AEP's perspective. Any potential legislative change is not imminent, particularly given a noisy election cycle. So perhaps we'll hear more after the election. As we've said earlier, any change to the existing legislation is likely to be financially insignificant AEP, and we will still be pushing for forward looking legislation regarding clean energy options, energy efficiency and other technology enhancements at grid scale and with our customers. Regarding the legal issues surrounding HB6, also nothing new to report and my previous comment stand on this subject. Now for the regulatory update, if there's one observation that has become apparent through this pandemic, it is the acknowledgement of the criticality of the service that we provide to our customers and communities. This year, we have weathered through the effects of a pandemic and overcome significant storm activity, that have challenged our system and our workforce. As we work with our regulators to position the company to be able to continue to meet the expectations of our customers and communities, we are stressing the fundamentals of a strong balance sheet. Now more than ever, it is essential for our operating companies to be well-positioned to have the cash flows and returns needed to attract the capital necessary to meet the ongoing needs of our customers and communities. And as you all know, we have a number of regulatory proceedings pending before our state regulators this quarter, most of which are needed to conform with previous regulatory stipulations, stay out provisions or to address the timing needs of critical investments. Ohio followed its most recent base case June 1, is required into the terms of our prior ESP for settlement. We are seeking a $41 million rate increase with a 10.15% ROE, a procedural schedule has not been established yet on that case. APCo filed its base rate case in March as required by Virginia law. We have completed hearings and the case has been submitted to the commission for a decision. Our Virginia residential customers have not experienced the rate increase over the past 10 years. In this case, we have asked for $37.9 million net of depreciation with an ROE of 9.9%. We were disappointed with the position taken by both staff and the AG, which fails to recognize our need to have an opportunity to earn our authorized return over the next trien period. We remain confident that the Commission will see through these arguments, and recognize their obligation under the law to allow the company an opportunity to earn a fair return. A decision is expected in November. Kentucky was subject to a stay out provision until June of this year. We subsequently filed our base rate case on June 29, where we asked for a $65 million increase and an ROE of 10%. The company has also sought to use the remaining unprotected AFDIT [ph] funds in Kentucky to offset bills for customers who cannot afford to pay their bills. The commissioner elected to combine this request with a base rate case filing and we expect resolution by yearend. Last but not least, in our SWEPCO jurisdiction, we received approval from the commission to create a regulatory asset for the costs associated with Hurricane Laura. We will ask for similar treatments for the costs associated with Hurricane Delta, and we are hopeful that we can put this year's hurricane season safely behind us. In Texas, SWEPCO made its base rate case filing on October 13, where we are seeking a $90.2 million increase with an ROE of 10.35%. We're also seeking to increase the storm reserve and increase our vegetation management expenditures to minimize the risk of future outages to our Texas customers. We continue to make progress on our North Central Wind projects, which will benefit our customers in Louisiana, Arkansas and Oklahoma. Foundation work is commenced at the Sundance facility, which is expected to be in service by the end of first quarter 2021, Invenergy is currently completing final site preparation on both the Maverick and Traverse locations. We continue to expect to acquire the Maverick facility by December 21, and the Traverse facility into December the first quarter of 2022 timeframe. We have filed our settlement true up in Arkansas and are finalizing our settlement true up in Oklahoma. We're looking forward to the benefits that these projects will bring to our customers, by providing access to some of the nation's richest wind resources and helping SWEPCO and PSO advance a greener energy future. So now to the equalizer chart, I'll talk about that. I think it's on Page 5 of the presentation. So our current ROE is about 9%. And you know we just generally target these returns to be in the 9.5% to 10% range. The ROEs below are not where they normalized. And certainly, keep in mind that we're also thickening equity layers as well. So, I'll talk about AEP Ohio first, I just mentioned the rate case there. It's above authorized primarily due to favorable regulatory items, partially offset by the roll off of the legacy issues that we've been talking about for years, regarding the [indiscernible] and the RSR. But we also expect the yearend ROE to trend around the authorized levels of 10%. For APCo, which I'd mentioned earlier is slightly below authorized, due a lower normalized usage and higher depreciation from increased capital investments, partially offset by continued management of the O&M expenses. Effective January 2020, costs associated with the last 17.5% of Wheeling Power's interest in Mitchell plant became recoverable through APCo and Wheeling rates. And then I've already discussed Virginia's tri-annual review. Kentucky, I already discussed the rate case there, but they're below and as you can see well-below authorized due to loss of load from weak economic conditions and loss of major customers, along with higher expenses during the stay out period. So, we have a lot of work to do there. I&M, the ROE for I&M at the end of third quarter was 10.4%. Its ROE was above authorized due to continued management of O&M expenses, reduced interest expense and rate true ups, partially offset by lower commercial industrial sales. I&M's ROE is projected to trend slightly below 10% by yearend, consistent with authorized ROEs in Michigan and in Indiana. PSO, its ROE is 8%. At the end of third quarter, it was below its authorized level primarily due to lower normalized usage and unfavorable weather in 2020, partially offset by continued management of O&M expenses. PSOs 2019 base case as you recall, approved the transmission track or a partial distribution tracker, and ROE of 9.4% authorized, so we'll continue to make progress there. SWEPCO, the ROE for SWEPCO is about 7.4%, and as you recall, much of that is related to the Turk Plant not being in retail rates in Arkansas, and that impacts by about 110 basis points. SWEPCO received an order in its Arkansas base case settlement in December 2019, and effective 2020 approved a $24 million revenue increase in ROE of 9.45%. In October 2020, we also filed the rate case in Texas, as I mentioned earlier. In AEP Texas, its ROE is around 7.5%, it was below authorized due to lag associated with a tiny of annual cost recovery filings. We did not make those filings during the pendency of the previous rate case, and of course, onetime adjustments from our finalized base rate case itself. Favorable regulatory treatment allows AEP Texas to file annual DCRF and TCOS filings, and we've since filed many of those at this point. I think there's been three cases that have been filed. And while earnings should improve in 2020, with a base rate case finalized and annual filings now resumed continued levels of investment in Texas will impact the ROE. The expectation is for the ROE to trend towards an authorized ROE of 9.4% in the long-term, but be around probably 8% by the end of 2020. As far as the transmission company is concerned, AEP Transmission Holdco was 9.8%, and it was below authorized primarily driven by the annual revenue true up in the second quarter of 2020 to return the over collection of 2019 revenues. Transmission is forecasted an ROE of 9.8% to 10.1% range in 2020. It is also interesting to note, that when you look at the average equity in our operating jurisdictions, The Transmission Holdco is now the largest, which that's happened for the first quarter. This first quarter that has actually occurred. So, making a lot of progress. But at the same time, though the investment is being made relative to transmission is certainly improving the quality of service to our customers. So, very happy with the progress we're making around our T&E investments and its ability to improve customers\u2019 experiences. As I close, I'd be remiss in not thanking our employees at the Oklaunion Power Station that was officially retired from service a couple of weeks ago, after several decades of providing generation resources, and meeting the needs of our customers electricity demands in Texas and Oklahoma. Oklaunion was under construction about the time I joined AEP out of college. And when you see people and assets retiring, it just further illustrates the resiliency of AEP over the last 114 years, but also the change occurs and we have to change with it. Thanks again to all the Oklaunion employees through the years. So, all-in-all, a solid quarter for AEP and I can't resist when thinking about AEPs future post-COVID, with the latent value of the need for resiliency and reliability of the grid to support work from home environments, moving forward with the transformation to clean energy resources, which we had AEP or in the beginning stages of, and the further electrification of the economy. We would say in the words of late Eddie Van Halen, it's about time, this time's our time, and right on, we'll let it shine. I am convinced in overcoming the challenges of 2020. This company will be even stronger as we move into 2021 and beyond. Brian? Brian Tierney : Thank you, Nick and good morning, everyone. I will take us through the third quarter and year-to-date financial results, provide some insight on load in the economy, review our balance sheet and liquidity and finish with a preview of what we will present at the EEI conference. Let's start briefly on Slide 6, which shows the comparison of GAAP to operating earnings for the quarter and year-to-date periods. GAAP earnings for the third quarter were $1.51 per share, compared to $1.49 per share in 2019. GAAP earnings through September were $3.56 per share, compared to $3.58 per share last year. There's a reconciliation of GAAP to operating earnings on Pages 15 to 16 of the presentation. Let's turn to Slide 7, and look at the drivers of quarterly operating earnings by segment. Operating earnings for the third quarter were $1.47 per share or $728 million, compared to $1.46 per share or $722 million in 2019. Operating earnings for vertically integrated utilities were $0.85 per share down $0.04. This was driven by unfavorable weather, primarily due to warmer than normal temperatures last year, particularly in September. Other drivers including lower wholesale load and other operating revenue, as well as higher depreciation and taxes, primarily due to timing that were averse in the fourth quarter. Favorable items included lower O&M, favorable rate changes and higher transmission revenue. The transmission and distribution utility segment earned $0.31 per share up $0.04 from last year. Favorable items included higher rate changes in transmission revenue, as well as lower O&M. These favorable items were partially offset by unfavorable weather, depreciation, taxes and interest expense. The AEP Transmission Holdco segment continue to grow, contributing $0.28 per share an improvement of $0.03. This reflected the return on investment growth as net plant increased by $1.5 billion or 16% since September of last year. Generation and marketing produced operating earnings of $0.13 per share, down $0.03 from last year. This was driven by timing around income taxes and lower wholesale margins. Finally, corporate and other was up a penny from last year, primarily driven by lower taxes related to consolidating items that will reverse by year-end. Let's turn to Slide 8, and review our year-to-date results. Operating earnings through September were $3.56 per share or $1.77 billion, compared to $3.65 per share or $1.8 billion in 2019. Looking at the drivers by segment, operating earnings for vertically integrated utilities were $1.90 per share comparable to last year. Favorable items in this segment included lower O&M, the impact of rate changes across multiple jurisdictions and higher transmission revenue primarily due to true ups. Weather was unfavorable due to warmer than normal winter temperatures this year and a warmer summer in 2019. Other decreases included higher depreciation and tax expenses, primarily due to timing and lower revenue items and AFUDC. The transmission and distribution utility segment earned $0.84 per share down a penny from last year. The negative variance was primarily driven by the 2019 reversal of a regulatory provision in Ohio. Other smaller drivers included higher depreciation and interest expense, the roll off of legacy riders in Ohio, prior year Texas carrying charges, unfavorable weather and tax expenses. These items were mostly offset by higher rate changes, the recovery of increased transmission investment in OCA [ph] and the impact of the Ohio transmission true up on both O&M and transmission revenue. Other O&M was also favorable due to the concerted effort to decrease O&M expenditures through one time and sustainable reductions. The AEP Transmission Holdco segment contributed $0.75 per share, down $0.07 from last year due to the impact of the annual true up and prior year FERC settlements. Our fundamental return on investment growth continued. Generation and marketing produced $0.31 per share, up a penny from last year. The Renewables business grew with asset acquisitions more than offsetting lower wholesale and retail margins and timing around income taxes. O&M sales and other onetime items offset the impact of weaker wholesale prices on the generating business. Finally, Corporate & Other was down $0.02 per share due to higher interest in taxes related to consolidating items that were reversed by the yearend, and offset by a prior year income tax adjustment. Partially offsetting these items was lower O&M. Overall, we are pleased with our financial results and are confident in confirming our annual operating earnings guidance of $4.25 to $4.45 per share. Turning to Slide 9, let's review the assumptions we shared during the first quarter earnings call to reaffirm guidance. Starting with the topline, we recently updated our retail sales forecast. Third quarter sales came in higher than previously projected. We now expect 2020 normalized sales to come in 2.7% below last year, which is 0.7% better than the load forecast from the first quarter. While the outlook has improved, it is still below the pre-recession forecast used for our original guidance. The favorable sales mix in 2020 has helped to mitigate the impact on earnings. The second item was the impact of weather. While the first quarter weather produced a significant drag, the second quarter and third quarter weather impacts were slightly favorable. In the second quarter presentation we mentioned that, July's weather was quite favorable. However, August and September weather was mild. As a result, we have revised the weather impact on 2020 earnings and now expect a $0.08 drag to 2020 results. The next item was on track the O&M expense. We had originally planned to drive O&M cost down to $2.8 billion from $3.1 billion in 2019. In response to the expected sales decline, we identified an additional $100 million of savings for both onetime in sustainable reductions and are on track to hit this lower expense target. Finally, we identified approximately $500 million of capital expenditures in the first quarter that could be shifted out of 2020 and in the future years. We made this decision to support our cash position through the expected downturn during the pandemic. As we discussed at the second quarter earnings call, results have come in better than expected and we've reinstated approximately $100 million of the $500 million back into 2020. Given the progress we've made on these key assumptions, we were able to reaffirm our 2020 operating earnings guidance range. Now let\u2019s turn to Slide 10, to provide an update on our normalize load. Starting in the lower right corner, our third quarter normalized load was down 2.6%, this was slightly better than the forecast we shared with you in the first quarter. Through September, our normalized sales were down 3% from last year. In the upper left quadrant, our normalized residential sales increased by 3.8% in the quarter. Year-to-date residential sales were up 2.6%. We saw significant increases in our residential load at the beginning of the pandemic. The growth in residential sales has moderated as people return to work over the summer. Weather normalized residential sales are up across all jurisdictions. Moving clockwise, our normalized commercial sales decreased by 4.6% in the third quarter, bringing the year-to-date decline to 4.9%. As expected, the biggest declines in this class came from schools, churches, restaurants and hotels. Finally in the lower left chart, industrial sales decreased by 7.8% in the quarter, bringing the year-to-date decline to 7%. A number of factors have changed the outlook for this class, but the biggest driver is overall economic activity. The industrial sectors that posted the biggest declines for the quarter were mining, oil and gas extraction and primary metals. By contrast, plastics and rubber manufacturing posted a strong quarter related to the recovery of the automotive industry. Overall, load growth across the service territory followed the pattern we anticipated earlier in the year. During the second quarter, residential sales peaked and commercial and industrial sales hit their lows. Since then, our service territory has been working its way back to a more normalized levels. Because some businesses will continue to work remotely, we expect our residential sales to continue at higher levels for some time. Let's take a deeper look into why we raised our outlook for normalized load on Slide 11. The solid bars represent weather normalized load growth by quarter end 2020. The green lines represent the updated load forecast we shared during the first quarter earnings call. At that time, there was still a lot of uncertainty regarding the depth and duration of the economic slowdown and how customers would respond. While that forecast accurately predicted the depth of the contraction in the second quarter, our third quarter results indicated a better recovery than forecasted. Our latest view, anticipates a continuation of this trend barring another shutdown of the economy. Now let's move on to Slide 12 and review the company's capitalization and liquidity. Our debt to capital ratio remain unchanged in the third quarter and stands at 61.1%. Our FFO to debt ratio decreased 1.3% during the quarter to 12.8% on a Moody's basis, primarily due to timing of fuel recovery, storm cost deferrals and a pension contribution. Importantly, we expect this metric to end the year in the low to mid-teens, consistent with the guidance we have provided. Our liquidity position remains strong at $3.8 billion, supported by a revolving credit facility. Before providing an update on pension funding, I would like to discuss the plan to finance the North Central Wind Project. As a reminder, we have stated that we intend to use equity to finance approximately two-thirds of this $2 billion project. We plan to issue equity in coordination with the completion of the three individual projects that comprise North Central Wind. For this reason, we will take a flexible approach which could include and at the market mechanism, asset rotation, as well as traditional secondary offerings. This approach avoids unnecessary dilution and helps us deliver on the 5% to 7% earnings growth rate. Turning to our pension, I am pleased to report that funding increased 3.6% during the quarter to 97%, and our OPEB Funding increased 5% to 141%. Strong equity returns was the primary driver for the increases. The pension plan also benefited from a company contribution in the amount of the plan's annual service cost of $111.5 million. Let's wrap this up on Slide 13, so we can get to your questions. We are reaffirming our existing 2020 operating earnings guidance of $4.25 to $4.45 per share. Our message at EEI will be that we are leading the way forward as a premium regulated utility with an ESG focus delivering 5% to 7% earnings growth with dividends growing in line with earnings. Our plan includes the $2 billion North Central Wind project in Oklahoma, benefiting our customers in PSO and SWEPCO as we transition to a cleaner energy future. We will provide detailed drivers for 2021 earnings guidance by segment and updates to our capital expenditure and financing plans. We look forward to talking with many of you at the virtual EEI conference in a couple of weeks. One final item, in 2021, we will release 2020 fourth quarter and full year earnings in late February, coincident with the filing of the 2020 10-K, like we did last year. With that, I will turn the call over to the operator for your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And we will go to Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Nick Akins : Good morning, Julien. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, howdy. Thanks for the time, guys. Perhaps just to kick things off. You talked about rolling out and reaffirming or perhaps preemptively reaffirming in the EEI the 5% to 7%. Can you talk a little bit about what's backstopping that? Specifically, in the last few months, we've seen some pretty substantial changes from some of your peers in Virginia. How can that play into APCo? And perhaps also similarly in Indiana, many of your peers are talking about opportunities. You all have perhaps Rockport. Just curious if you can talk about or perhaps foreshadow some of the conversations here on that role forward, if you don't mind, at the outset. Brian Tierney : Julien, I think a lot of the things that we're going to talk about are renewable opportunities in addition to North Central Wind, how we're transitioning from a carbon-based generating fleet much more to a lot of the renewables that the Virginia Clean Energy Act enables and legislation in Indiana enables as well. So we're going to provide a lot more detail on that at EEI and take you through what that looks like. You have the renewable requirement in Virginia. You mentioned APCo. We've got the requirement there. And also Indiana, Michigan, we continue to do renewables in various areas there. We're also doing renewables, we just did fourth sale in Oklahoma. And then we also have renewable applications here in Ohio that are brewing as well. So, we'll have plenty to talk about. And I think, we don't we don't spend and then maybe we should spend more talking about the opportunities we've got available to us from a renewable standpoint. But the way I see it is that, we're just on the precipice of a massive transformation to renewable resources. And AEP, if you look at the runway it's pretty substantial. And that will continue particularly as we do individual relationships with customers, but also in terms of the regulated side as well, through the Integrated Resource Planning process. So we'll certainly talk more about that at November EEI. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. Thanks for entertaining me there. Perhaps, if I can get more detailed here, if you don't mind. I know you all provided a little bit more of you want 23 here, but in tandem, you gave an updated view on FFO to total debt under Moody's definition of low to mid-teens versus perhaps prior characterizations of mid-teens. Is that simply a factor of rolling forward here? Or how are you thinking about this at this point? Brian Tierney : Julien, the low to mid-teens is completely consistent with our prior messaging on FFO to debt. And that outlook was incorporated in Moody's when they made their adjustments back in August. And remember that will continue to improve as some of this accumulative deferred income taxes that is being repaid to the regulatory jurisdictions are occurring much more quickly than we thought, maybe we originally thinking 10 years. And it turned out to be five years. And that's occurring more quickly. So that FFO to debt metric will pick up as that rolls off. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. Excellent. Thank you. Brian Tierney : Yes. Operator : Our next question is from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Durgesh Chopra : Hey, good morning. Thanks. Great. Hey, just digging in a little bit into 2021. I appreciate you'll share more color at EEI. But could you quantify for us what that 2%, 2.7% sales degradation was year-to-date, part one? And part two, should we assume some of that $51 million year-to-date O&M savings to be carried forward into the next year? Brian Tierney : Yes. So let me start with the 2.7% load degradation. It's what you would expect. It's largely commercial and industrial sales. The decrease is being offset by residential. And so, what we've seen is it takes more than just looking at the raw numbers on residential, commercial and industrial, it's really the mix. You remember, we make more margin on residential sales than we do on commercial and industrial. And that mix has come in better than we had anticipated at the beginning of the pandemic. So, it's not been as dire as what we thought it might be because of what's happened with the sales mix, rather than just the overall decreases. So that's been positive. Looking forward on O&M, we have for a number of years been tightening our belt and been very, very tight around untracked O&M in that $2.8 billion to $3.1 billion range. And with what we're doing with achieving excellence, and everything else we're doing with sustainable and non-sustainable O&M cuts, I'd anticipate us being towards the lower end of that range going forward. Durgesh Chopra : Understood. Nick Akins : When we look at the load forecast, I mean if you assume 2021 is going to be better, which we believe it is. And you look at that mix, we don't see residential. I mean, obviously, it will moderate as the economy comes back on the industrial and commercial side, commercial in particular. But still, you're going to have a continued longstanding remnant of improved residential support just by virtue of what companies have learned from the work from home environment. So, I'm a little bit bullish on the load and then at least a financial picture associated with load. And then when you look at the O&M this achieving excellence program it has truly been a fundamental change for us and augmentation of all the lean activities and other things that we did before. And it really is focused on a regular part of our budget process to ensure that we're capturing savings and every step along the way. So, feeling pretty good about the continual progress year-on-year of achieving excellence. Durgesh Chopra : That's great, guys. Thanks for that color. Maybe just initial thoughts and I appreciate that that was going to be in the details, but initial thoughts on elections, taxes, climate plan and implications for AEP? Nick Akins : Yes, so I guess, well, first of all, it's the election, certainly as a noisy election cycle, and who knows what's going to happen here, we never know. But we've got 114 years history of managing between the goalposts here, so we'll continue to do that. And our focus is on move into that clean energy economy. So really, the only difference obviously, is maybe the pace at which the change will occur if there's a Biden administration versus Trump. But nevertheless, it doesn't change that much for us, because we're focused on moving that clean energy economy as quickly as we can, to ensure that we are making that transition into the future that we know it's going to happen. Now, who knows where technology will go, even for fossil fuels, but nevertheless, we'll continue that transition to renewables and certainly some natural gas to ensure that we are delivering for our customers in the future. So, from a client perspective, we have an excellent record and I think that's why we get seen from the ESG community where they know what we're doing, they know what our message is, we're making continual progress. And we'll continue to make that progress. And then when you think about, as I said, in my original write up, I used the word latent, because it is a somewhat of an undeveloped or emerging activity around electrification of the economy, certainly around O&M and what we find with digitization and automation. And then, of course, as we move forward with the transformation, the generation transformation that we see ahead of us. So that's, that's why I'm feeling pretty good about where this company is heading. Brian Tierney : Just a quick update on taxes. If we were to have an increase in taxes, we anticipate that our commissions would handle it. Really, one of two ways and not dissimilar to how they handled tax reform three or four years ago. We anticipate that they would either allow the increase to be deferred until the next rate proceeding, or we anticipate that they'd have kind of a one issue, order come out where they would allow us to adjust rates just to reflect the new expected higher income tax rate. In any event, we wouldn't expect it to be a significant driver to earnings or cash for the company going forward. Durgesh Chopra : Great. Thanks. But it could be a modest delve into cash flow, like given sort of a reset in AVIT [ph] and amongst other things. Nick Akins : I think the [Indiscernible]. Brian Tierney : Yes. Again, we don't anticipate it to be significant one way or the other. Durgesh Chopra : Understood. Thanks, Brian. Thank you, Nick. Brian Tierney : Thank you. Nick Akins : Yep. Operator : Our next question is from James Thalacker with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Nick Akins : Good morning, James. Hello? James Thalacker : Hey, thanks, guys. I apologize about the [multiple speakers]. Good morning. Two real quick questions. Just first, I guess, Brian, just addressing, North Central wind, I noticed in the slides that Traverse look like potentially be in service could be pushed out maybe by a quarter or so. Could you talk a little bit about it? Is that just a supply chain issue related to COVID? Or there's something else that was kind of driving that extended outlook? Brian Tierney : Yes, a lot of it has to do more so than actual physical things. It's our ability to get permitting and the like done. And so during the shutdown, it was hard to be able to get into the offices, do land acquisitions, title searches and things like that. And that just potentially pushed us back at big teams. We're not in anticipating anything material there. We still anticipate late this year to early next year which is one of the signal that due to some of those unanticipated issues largely associated with COVID that that project could have a range of when it would come online. Nick Akins : Hey, James, we feel like it's still going to be the end of the summer, but obviously it could fall into that range in the first quarter, we're confident of that particular range. But remember, we're not making any progress payments, either. It's sort of we require it when it's done. So from a financial perspective it's fine. James Thalacker : Okay, great. Thanks. And I guess, just following up on that same issue. Brian, you talked about, three sort of potential ways to finance the final acquisition of those and this has been beat to death. But as you guys look to give 2021 guidance, obviously, an ATM would be something because spread over the full year, but asset rotation or even block equity, really probably something I think, as you were saying, sort of coordinating it with the final close would be something maybe closer to the end of the year. How are you guys, I guess thinking about that from a modeling perspective, as you present 2021? Brian Tierney : It kind of matches what Nick was saying is that the projects don't -- we don't get the projects until commercial completion is done, we then get the project. And given the discrete nature of them, we can really time the equity issuance very closely with when the project comes online. And James the reason, we need that flexibility, you look at Sundance, which we're anticipating in the first quarter of 2020, that's about a $300 million project. We'll be able to time the equity issuance, if that's what it is closely with when that project comes online. The next one, which we're anticipating at the end of 2021, is about a $400 million project, Maverick. And then the last one is Traverse, which is about $1.3 billion and we talked about that being late 2021, early 2022. We believe that whether it's an aftermarket program, a follow on issuance or asset rotation, we're going to be able to time those very, very closely with when those discrete projects come online. So from a modeling standpoint, the timing that we're talking about really is going to be insignificant to 2021. And I'd start repeating myself and shaping it in 2021. Nick Akins : James, Brian mentioned the options we're looking at. And rest assured internally, we're also being at the death. So, we'll make sure that we're making the right decisions relative to the timing associated with those investments. James Thalacker : No worries. I understand the in service space, and it gives you guys a lot of flexibility. The last question, I guess, I just had, and you kind of answered my initial question was going back to the trailing 12 months FFO kind of dip down. You guys were looking for that sort of trend back into kind of where you guys were thinking sort of low to mid-teens, I guess. Are you still targeting that in the sort of '21, '22, '23 timeframe? I know you updated your cash flow forecasts for that recently. Nick Akins : Yes, we are. It's that timeframe, yes. James Thalacker : Okay, perfect. Thank you so much for the time. Brian Tierney : Thanks, James. Operator : And next, we'll go to Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Nick Akins : Good morning, Michael. Michael Lapides : Good morning, Nick. Thank you guys for taking my question. And Nick, sorry about your LSU Tigers. Nick Akins : Yes. Alabama is doing good though. I'm sure you're happy with that. Michael Lapides : Yes, let's hope they keep coaching. Brian, I want to come back to tax a little bit and who the heck Uncle Sam\u2019s is going to do in the next year or so regarding corporate tax rates. But if there's a change in administration, if there's a higher corporate tax rate, I think we\u2019ve seen numbers floated around 27% or 28%. I get that it's probably not much of an impact on the earnings power one way or another for AEP. But if you're talking to state commissioners or staff at the PSCs, or PUCs or others, it is a rate increase on customers. And it's a double whammy, because the cost of service goes up due to the higher tax rate and that just kind of flows through rates. But also the flow back of assets kind of slows down or declines. And it just strikes me as if I must say utility commissioner for public policy maker and given state, you're asking for what could be pretty decent size rate increases on customers coming out of an economic downturn. How does that get offset? I think about it from the customer standpoint. What's the get [Indiscernible]. Nick Akins : Hey, I think there's no doubt that -- and again, I think there was a lot of advantage taken with it with the tax reductions that occurred. And you're right, there's no doubt that there will be headroom that is reduced, because it is certainly going to be an impact to put those back in. Now, the question is how to put back in or what time frame and that kind of thing. But also that's why it's so important for us to move forward as quickly as possible and accelerate achieving excellence, so that we can mitigate that impact as much as possible. But still, you're looking at it in the face of a definite need for rehabilitation and continued capitalization of the grid to ensure that we have reliability and resiliency of supply, particularly when you're dealing with hurricanes, wildfires, cyber, all those kinds of issues we have to respond to that. So there'll be rate increases associated with the implementation of new taxes. And I think it's unavoidable, but certainly it's incumbent on us to make sure we mitigate that as much as possible with our achieving excellence program and other measures. And we'll have discussions with the commissions, just like we had discussions when tax reform occurred. And, it's unfortunate we didn't do it over a longer period of time like we had suggested, because then it would mitigate even the return of taxes. And if we continue vacillating back and forth like this, that's going to be a continual issue for our industry that our regulators need to recognize. We do have to keep some reserve there to ensure that we're not moving customer rates around, as much as could be as if it becomes pretty volatile. So, your point is well recognized, but we'll do what we can to mitigate the effects and we'll have those conversations. But I think one thing that's also come into play here, though is, is the nature of the importance of the service that we provide, for everyone to be able to watch their Netflix or do all the things they need to do at home, work from home. All those sorts of activities will change the nature of how we look at residential supply. And there's no question that that's going to change going forward. And that's why I'm always troubled by the commission saying that AMR versus AMI, for example, the investments we want to make in AMI, it's not because AMI is you don't just look at the cost of the meters of AMI and the undepreciated balance associated with AMR. You've got to look at what you're leveraging into and that's the customers\u2019 ability to adjust to their own energy picture and be able to drive energy efficiency and all those things and give the customer the opportunity to do that, as opposed to of the system just decide in that forum. So, I think there's just a lot of things we need to have discussions about with our regulators to really focus on what that future actually means. And with electrification of the economy, that's clearly going to be an issue that we need to deal with to make sure our customers are more resilient, more reliable and as economic as possible, but also give them the opportunity to make adjustments on their total bill as opposed to dealing on a headline on rate increases. Michael Lapides : Got it. Thank you for that, Nick. And then one other question, totally unrelated. I'm thinking about states where you've not really talked about sizable rate base growth and investment. One of those that stands out a little bit is West Virginia. How do you think about going forward, the pace of generation transformation in a state like West Virginia? Nick Akins : Yes, I think, we're looking at all of our states now and all our state jurisdictions, and it's really sort of our resource planning on steroids. And even the dogs like it. And I think there's no question that we're in the process of moving forward with that transformation as quickly as possible, making significant T&D investments, but all and you see that based on the changes in capital. But then when you look at states like West Virginia, we will be -- I think the first step is going to be how we run coal fired capacity, for example, where we have other forms of energy coming in and have lower capacity factors on coal units, but still they be available if those times where, you have severe cold weather, or really warm weather in the summer. So, it's a way we run these facilities during the interim, but then it's also that transition that we make going forward. I think that's true for all of the jurisdictions. And our jurisdictions have been fairly conservative in making that transition. I think that pace can quick and though, as a result of the even the bipartisan focus on continuing to lower emissions in our plant. So, I think there's the catalysts are there. And actually, post-election, who knows what'll happen, but I still see, you're already seeing some Republican and Democratic legislation that's being proposed that tries to answer that question. And if you have that from a national standpoint and the states are moving forward with their own resolutions, and then we can be particularly helpful in ensuring that occurs as quickly as possible. Michael Lapides : Got it. Thank you, Nick. Sorry about the [Indiscernible], and I both appreciate it. Thanks guys. Nick Akins : No, that's fine. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Sophie Karp with KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Sophie Karp : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Nick Akins : Yes, sure thing. Good morning. Sophie Karp : I'm curious, I want to go back to kind of the load composition and the rate case activity. So, as we roll forward and the load dislocation continues to be persist, where we have this unusual situation where residential, maybe it's higher, but C&I is suppressed. And that's not really a normalized picture. So, if you go through your rate cases now, and the future rate cases where this period becomes your test here, right? How do you address that? Did you attempt to normalize? Do you just go with what they actually look like? So, that's my first question, I guess. Nick Akins : Yes. So, we have multiple utilities, right. So, we have the opportunity to move around capital investment to time it with relative rate case activity to ensure that we are spinning on the right things at the right time. Not to say that we're trying to load the budgets or anything, what we're saying is that, that when we go through the rate case, filings, it's important to not only have discussions with the Commissions about what we're spending on, but what the results of that spending will be. So, if the load is not increasing, obviously, it exaggerate. It certainly challenges the rate impacts, because the denominator is not growing. If the denominator is growing, obviously, that's helpful. But if it isn't, you're still having to make choices about what the priorities are for each regulatory jurisdiction based on discussions with the Commissions to help us determine, okay, number one, what are we willing to pay for, number two, what are those priorities that exist. And some of those are absolute priorities and some of them are things that yes, we'd like to do, but it may be that we have to work out for a longer period of time before bringing that in. So, there's all kinds of dialogues that occur, relative to what that prioritization should be. And we'll continue doing that with our Commissions. And we have done, whether it's gone, where the economy is going well, or whether the economy has been in a downturn. I think we're moving toward an upturn. So that's going to be helpful. Brian Tierney : Sophie, we also have some jurisdictions that have forward looking test years, so we'll be able to incorporate a forward looking view. And then we have places like Ohio, where residential and small commercial are already decoupled. So, there are lots of mitigations to unusual load circumstances that we find ourselves in right now. Nick Akins : And some of these things are known and reasonable adjustments too, so you have to look at the 2020 test year and say, we had to make these changes because of COVID. And COVID is going to be sort of a unique circumstance and then we had to react. And actually, the Commissions themselves, we had moratoriums on customer cut-offs. So, there is adjustments we all made in that process, and I think we'll make those adjustments coming out of that process as well. Sophie Karp : Great. Thank you. And then, if I may a quick follow-up on the Central Wind. You mentioned assets rotation, I guess, as a part of the considerations for equity financing there. What might those be? Is this more of a like one-off situation with churn assets in your portfolio? Or could we be looking at something more strategic here? Thank you. Nick Akins : Well, so when we talk about potential assets, we look at everything, and we look at sources and uses. And obviously, we want the use part of it right now is how do we finance North Central Wind, a major project. And the sources can be anything in our portfolio, and that's where portfolio management is going to be a key part of what we do in the future. So, I'm not going to say, specifically what we're looking at, or anything like that at this point. But what I will say is that it's incumbent on us to be looking at everything from a source perspective, and then focusing on how we deploy capital in the best way and transfer that into really projects like North Central, and be able to fund it in the best way to ensure our shareholder value. And we will continue to do that. So, I think you got what the sort of year play out. Sophie Karp : Thank you. Nick Akins : Yep. Operator : And with no further questions, yes, I'll turn it back to you. Darcy Reese : Great. Thank you for joining us on today's call.

And as a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Darcy Reese. Please go ahead. Darcy Reese : Thank you, Cynthia. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Call for American Electric Power. We appreciate you taking time today to join us. Our earnings release, presentation slides and related financial information are available on our website at aep.com. Today, we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors. Nicholas Akins : Good. Thanks, Darcy. And Darcy says happy birthday Bette Jo, this one's for you. But welcome, everyone, to the American Electric Power's Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. 2020 was a year of tremendous challenges, the likes of which we have never seen. It appears that 2021 has thus far had its own set of challenges. Our hearts go out to everyone that has been and are impacted by the ongoing challenges of COVID, and all the customers impacted by the severe cold and ice conditions that precipitated significant outages from Texas to West Virginia and beyond. There will be plenty of opportunities to do a postmortem of the conditions that led to these outages and to address changes to help ensure these kinds of events do not occur again. But as of now, getting customers back and some return to normalcy is paramount in everyone's mind. I'll discuss these issues a little later, but I want to tell you, in the midst of significant challenges, comes tremendous accomplishments that make us even stronger for the future, and AEP has once again delivered. The fourth quarter further illustrate the resiliency of AEP and its employees to deliver and exceed expectations in ensuring the consistent quality of earnings and dividend growth that you would expect from our premium regulated utility. AEP's operating earnings for the quarter came in at $0.87 a share, ending the year at $4.44 per share, which is the top of the operating earnings range that we projected for 2020, an excellent outcome, buoyed by our employees' aggressive moves to control costs during the COVID downturn of the economy, the arbitrage of residential to industrial and commercial loads that we have discussed in previous earnings calls, and certain tax and investment related outcomes that went our way, along with positive regulatory outcomes in several of our cases that concluded in 2020. Given the progress that we have made on cost control with our Achieving Excellence Program and in updating our load forecast for 2021, AEP is now revising our operating earnings guidance range for 2021, upward from a midpoint of $4.61 per share to $4.65 per share, bringing our new guidance range to $4.55 to $4.75 per share. We're also rebasing our 5% to 7% operating earnings growth rate on the new 2021 guidance range and continue in our view that we would be disappointed not to be in the upper half of the guidance range. AEP is reaffirming our $37 billion 5-year capital plan and are committed to our credit ratings quality as we move forward. Julia Sloat : Thank you, Nick. Thank you, Darcy, and happy birthday, Bette Jo. It's good to be with everyone this morning. I'm going to walk us through the fourth quarter results, spend a little more time on the full year financial results, share some thoughts on our service territory load and economy, review our balance sheet and liquidity and then we'll finish up with our revised outlook for 2021. So let's go to Slide 6, which shows the comparison of GAAP to operating earnings for the quarter and for the year-to-date periods. GAAP earnings for the fourth quarter were $0.88 per share compared to $0.31 per share in 2019. GAAP earnings for the year were $4.44 per share compared to $3.89 per share in 2019. There's a reconciliation of GAAP to operating earnings on Pages 15 and 16 of the presentation today. So let's walk through our fourth quarter operating earnings performance by segment, which is laid out on Slide 7. Operating earnings for the fourth quarter totaled $0.87 per share compared to $0.60 per share in 2019. The detail by segment is provided in the boxes on the chart. But to summarize, the change in our collective regulated businesses was driven by lower O&M and the return on incremental investment to serve our customers, which more than offset higher depreciation and unfavorable weather. On the generation and marketing side, earnings were up $0.05 from 2019. This was driven by land sales and favorable effects associated with the retirement of plant and the generation business as well as higher wholesale margins. Lower retail margins were offset by the expected timing of income taxes. Corporate and Other was up $0.10 from last year, primarily due to lower taxes relating to state tax adjustments and consolidating items and investment gain on a privately held investment, all of which was partially offset by higher O&M. So let's take a look at our full year results on Page #8. Annual operating earnings for 2020 were $4.44 per share or $2.2 billion compared to $4.24 per share or $2.1 billion in 2019. Looking at the drivers by segment. Operating earnings for Vertically Integrated Utilities were $2.21 per share, up $0.04 year-over-year. Favorable items in this segment included lower O&M, the impact of rate changes across multiple jurisdictions and higher transmission revenue, primarily due to true-ups. Weather was unfavorable due to warmer-than-normal temperatures in 2020 and a warmer summer in 2019. Other decreases included higher depreciation and tax expenses and lower revenue items in AFUDC. Transmission and Distribution Utilities segment earned $1.03 per share, up $0.03 from 2019. Favorable drivers in this segment included higher rate changes, the recovery of increased transmission investment in ERCOT and the impact of the Ohio transmission true-up, both on O&M and transmission revenue. Other O&M was favorable due to the concerted effort to decrease O&M expenditures through onetime and sustainable reductions. These items were partially offset by the 2019 reversal of a regulatory provision in Ohio and higher depreciation associated with the increased investment. Other smaller drivers include things like higher interest and tax expenses. The roll-off of legacy riders in Ohio, prior year Texas carrying charges, unfavorable weather and AFUDC. The transmission - the AEP Transmission Holdco segment contributed $1.03 per share, down $0.02 from 2019 due to the impacts of the annual true-up and prior year FERC settlements. Our fundamental return on investment growth continued as net plant increased by $1.3 billion or 13% since December of 2019. Generation & Marketing produced $0.36 per share, up $0.06 year-over-year. The Renewables business grew with asset acquisitions. Land sales and other onetime items more than offset the impact of weaker wholesale prices on the Generation business and lower retail margins. Finally, Corporate and Other was up $0.09 per share, driven by taxes from lower state taxes and adjustments as well as an investment gain, partially offsetting these items with higher interest expense. Overall, we're pleased with our 2020 financial results as we landed in the upper half of our operating earnings guidance range. So let's take a look at our normalized load for the quarter on Page 9. Starting in the lower right corner, our fourth quarter normalized load came in 0.2% above the fourth quarter of 2019. This was significant, not only because it was the first time we saw positive load growth since the pandemic began, but it was also the strongest quarter for load growth in over 2 years. For the year, AEP's 2020 normalized load finished down 2.2% compared to 2019. Normalized load has continued to improve since bottoming out in the second quarter of 2020 when COVID restrictions were at their highest levels. A strong finish for the year and our retail load is one of the drivers that enabled us to reach the upper end of our guidance range in 2020. I'll talk a little bit more about why this occurred when we get to Slide 11, where we can view some economic data specific to our service territory. But for 2021, we're projecting 0.2% growth in normalized load. While this will be an improvement from the 2.2% decline in 2020, it also shows that our service territory is gradually getting back to its normal growth trajectory. In the upper left quadrant, our normalized residential sales increased by 5.2% in the fourth quarter and ended the year, up 3.2%. For both the quarter and year-to-date comparisons, growth in residential sales was spread across every operating company. Residential loads spiked in the second quarter of 2020 when the COVID restrictions were at their highest and people were spending the majority of their time at home. Looking to this year, while we expect residential sales to decline by 1.1% in 2021 as vaccinations are rolled out and as we migrate to our post-pandemic lives, we are assuming a moderate sustained load benefit from this segment, given the stickiness from work-from-home relationships or arrangements for many office workers across our service territory for the foreseeable future. So let's slide over to commercial sales in the upper right quadrant. Normalized commercial sales decreased by 2.1% in the fourth quarter and finished the year down 4.2%. Even though commercial sales were down across all operating companies in the quarter, we're seeing steady improvement since the pandemic began. In fact, the same sectors that were hardest hit by the shutdowns in the second quarter of 2020 were the most improved sectors in the fourth quarter. Specifically these sectors included schools, churches, restaurants and hotels. As when you look forward to 2021, we expect commercial sales to experience a modest 0.5% decline as the service territory continues to recover, which is still a significant improvement from the record-setting 4.2% decline we saw in 2020. The improvement in commercial sales will likely track with vaccinations and as a service territory population acquires additional immunity, this class of customers should be positioned for a strong recovery. In the lower left chart, industrial sales increased - or decreased by 2% in the quarter, ending the year down 5.7%. Even though industrial sales were down for the quarter in aggregate, we did have a few operating companies, namely I&M, AEP Ohio and AEP Texas post growth in industrial sales compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. Our projection for 2021 assumes industrial sales will continue to recover and end the year, up 1.9%. On Slide 10, we have a little more color on the industrial recovery we saw in the fourth quarter. The blue bar show the growth in sales to our oil and gas customers, led by growth in the pipeline transportation sector. Our total oil and gas sector sales in the fourth quarter came in 1.3% above last year. In fact, the pipeline transportation sector has been the fastest-growing sector since 2018. The orange bars show the growth in industrial sales, excluding oil and gas. While it was still down 3.3% for the quarter, you can see how dramatic the sequential improvement has been since the second quarter. The industrial sectors that are experiencing the strongest growth for the quarter were pipeline transportation and plastics and rubber manufacturing. This is mostly offset by softer demand from oil and gas extraction, mining and primary metals. Overall, we're seeing evidence of faster recovery in the industrial sector, which supports our projected growth in industrial sales for 2021. We anticipate improvements across most sectors with the exception of the coal mining sector as the industry faces headwinds with the shift toward reduced carbon dioxide emissions. So if you join me on Slide 11, I can provide the update, I mentioned a few moments ago, on the latest economic conditions within the AEP footprint. Starting with the chart on the left, you'll notice that AEP service territory experienced a 2% decline in gross regional product compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. This was 40 basis points better than the U.S. The AEP service territory was less impacted by the virus and had fewer restrictions on businesses than other parts of the country, which allowed our territory economy to fare better than the U.S. throughout the pandemic. Looking forward, the AEP service territory is expected to grow by 4.8% in 2021, relatively consistent with the economic recovery in the U.S. Moving to employment on the right, you can see that the job market for the AEP service territory also performed better than the U.S. throughout the pandemic. For the quarter, employment was down 4.6%, which was 1.4% better than the U.S. This is largely the result of the mix of jobs within our local economy, which has a heavier relative concentration of manufacturing and government jobs and a smaller share of leisure and hospitality jobs. Going forward, we expect the job growth of 1.1% in our service territory in 2021. So let's turn over to Page 12 to check on the company's capitalization and liquidity position. Our debt-to-cap ratio increased 0.7% in the fourth quarter to 61.8%. FFO to debt increased by 0.2% during the quarter to 13% on a Moody's basis, primarily due to changes in regulatory assets and working capital. Our liquidity position remains strong at $2.5 billion, supported by our revolving credit facility. I'd like to touch base on a couple of things relating to our financing plan as we receive questions from time to time on this. So our current financing plan does not include an assumption of any asset rotation. I'd like to share that we do believe it is incumbent upon us to engage an analysis of any opportunity within our portfolio that can generate more value for another party than it can generate for us. So to the extent that we engage in such activity that would result in the sale of an asset or a business unit, the associated proceeds would likely supplant some of the planned equity and/or debt financing you see on Page 39 in the appendix of the presentation today. Nick talked about the severe winter weather in Texas, which impacted both SPP and ERCOT. I want to take a moment to provide some quantification exposure details, since that's top of mind for us and also for you. As you know, the winter storm increased the demand for natural gas and limited natural gas supply availability, resulting in unanticipated market prices for natural gas power plants to meet reliability needs for the SPP electric system. PSO's preliminary estimate of natural gas cost and purchases of electricity are approximately $825 million. SWEPCO's preliminary estimate of natural gas cost is $375 million. To provide some perspective, PSO's annual fuel and purchase power costs are roughly $550 million to $600 million. So you get the sense of how big that is. Importantly, PSO and SWEPCO have active fuel clauses that permit recovery of prudently incurred fuel and purchase power expenses. However, we would expect this recovery to likely occur over an extended period of time in an effort to mitigate the impact on customer bills, which is consistent with the filing we submitted yesterday, seeking a regulatory asset and mechanism to recover the costs, inclusive of PSO's weighted average cost of capital. So we're taking this into consideration as it relates to our financing plans since the payments to suppliers are due in March. On that note, we're contemplating the use of long-term debt and the possibility of making funding contributions to PSO and SWEPCO from the parent company. As far as ERCOT exposure goes, as Nick mentioned, this would be related to AEP Texas' receipt of funds from the reps, AEP Renewables' wind generation assets and the wholesale load served by AEP Energy Partners, this exposure should not be significant. Switching gears. Our qualified pension funding increased 5% during the quarter to 101.8%, and our OPEB funding increased 20.4% to 160.9%. Strong equity returns in both plans were the primary driver for the funded status increases during the fourth quarter. The OPEB-planned funded status also benefited from lower-than-expected per capita and Medicare advantage rates, which reduced the liability. So let's go to Slide 13 to do a quick recap of where we've been and where we're going. So we begin 2020 with a proven track record. Our earnings in 2020 - sorry, we began 2021 with a proven track record. Our earnings were strong in 2020, as we continue to invest capital in our businesses and earn a return on this investment in response to expect the decline in sales from the pandemic and early mild weather, we implemented O&M savings from both onetime and sustainable reductions and we also got some help from favorable sales mix shift. We received approval of our North Central Wind project in Oklahoma, and that will be a benefit to our PSO and SWEPCO customers. In addition, over time, we've been able to grow our dividend in line with earnings and expect to be able to do so going forward. Our dividend payout ratio is solidly within our stated target range of 60% to 70%. So as we look forward to 2020, we feel confident in raising our operating earnings guidance range to $4.55 per share to $4.75 per share. This is up from our previously stated 2021 operating earnings guidance range of $4.51 per share to $4.71 per share. There's an operating earnings waterfall on Page 31 of the appendix reflecting the midpoint of this updated guidance. The primary differences from what we shared at EEI relate to normalized load and weather reflecting 2020 actual results as well as continued focus on sustainable O&M savings from lessons learned during the pandemic. Not surprisingly, examples on the O&M front include things like reduced nonessential travel and training since we know now a great deal of this can be done very effectively in a virtual format, sustaining some of the reduction in material and supply expenses, minimizing over time and efficiency modifications in our field crew practices, et cetera, just to name a few. Specifically, we're originally forecasting our 2021 untracked O&M to be $2.7 billion. but now we are forecasting this to be $2.62 billion compared to the $2.68 billion actual for 2020. So as we proceed through 2021, we'll finalize our pending rate cases and move forward with additional opportunities in the renewable space, supporting our ESG focus, as we transition toward a clean energy future. We will continue our disciplined approach to allocating capital, and we're confident there is significant runway in our capital programs to reaffirm our 5% to 7% growth rate of the increased 2021 operating earnings guidance range. So thanks so much for joining us for the call today. With that, I'm going to turn it over to the operator for your questions. Operator : . And we will go to the line of Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Securities. Shahriar Pourreza : Just a couple of questions - just a couple of quick questions here. Nick, just on the Ohio settlement, it seems like you've been kind of close to a resolution for some time now with sort of the procedural schedule being paused to make room for continued dialogue. Is there sort of any pushes and takes we should be sort of thinking about at this juncture? Is the noise in the state, at all, impacting the conversations? Nicholas Akins : No. The noise - there's no impact there. We continue in discussions with the parties. And the typical issues of distribution riders and ROEs and that kind of thing. So nothing unusual. And like I said, I think some of the discussions are going positively, and the parties continue to engage with one another. And we all know we have March 4 and I think that could actually be 2 or 3 days different as well. But nevertheless, everyone is focused on getting that concluded. Shahriar Pourreza : Excellent. And then just on the Racine hydro sale, obviously, had an immaterial impact to sort of the financing plan, but it does sort of show kind of your desire to focus on the core business. So how are you sort of thinking about further asset optimization that could potentially offset some of the equity needs related to North Central? Whether we're thinking about a full utility transaction with an underperforming asset, for instance? Or a partial sale transaction may be similar to the Duke-GIC deal? Any sort of updated thoughts here on incremental opportunities you're seeing in the near term? Nicholas Akins : Yes. There's a lot of creative ways, obviously, and Duke showed one of those, but there's others as well. Yes, we'll continue to look at all of our assets, actually. And as I mentioned in the call, the time for half measures and talk is over. So we've got to get about the process of ensuring that we're making the way to move to that clean energy future. That means we're going to have to make sure that we're rotating capital effectively and dealing with assets from an optimization standpoint in an effective fashion going forward. So that is a prime motivation for us, particularly with maintaining our balance sheet structure the way it is. We want to make absolutely sure that we manage this process actively in all of those ways. So - and that's why Brian is over in the strategy area to focus on some of these activities as well. So we'll continue that approach, and you'll see more to come. Shahriar Pourreza : Got it. That's helpful. And then lastly for me, just on Rockport 2 and Pirkey. Any sort of additional thoughts there on the replacement generation and potentially what the implications could be sort of this 5-year capital plan you presented this morning? Nicholas Akins : Yes. The 3,300 megawatts is an incremental 2,400 megawatts of what we had before. And some of that is related to Pirkey obviously. When you talk about Rockport, that's still yet to come. So there's still plenty of analysis getting done of all of our operating jurisdictions. And that's what I've talked about before, where we'll come out with our plans, which will be reflected in our integrated resource plans, and that would accommodate Rockport in any of the other measures that we have in place to move to that clean energy future. So you'll see that, like I said, by the time we get to the first quarter earnings call or before. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steven Fleishman of Wolfe Research. Steven Fleishman : Just, I guess, first question in terms of the 2021 guidance increase. If you go back to the segment, back to EEI. I think a lot of it is in the Corporate and Other segment. Could you clarify better like what's driving that? Nicholas Akins : Yes. So in 2020, the Corporate and Other investments, there were some tax-related issues around the tax provisions that were put in place relative to COVID. And then also, there was some investment returns that were actually around - we were an early investor in charge point. And certainly, we had some opportunities there to monetize by the end of the year. And there are warrants that we held. So we continue to invest in different technologies. And we have investments that have gone positively. We've had investments that have gone negatively. And this is - this happened to be a year where it was positive from an investment standpoint. So - but from an ongoing perspective, it really is not so much driven. There still is some investment related activity that bleeds over into '21. But I'd say the story of '21 is, when we had - we didn't know exactly where the load was going, didn't know where the economy was going. We're feeling much better about that and the progress in 2021. And also our Achieving Excellence Program. We continue to advance in a very positive way from that perspective. So we felt like - certainly, the confidence level was much more for us to raise guidance, but also continue to encourage that we'll be in the upper half of that guidance range. Julia Sloat : And Steve, this is Julie. The items that we're calling out here, obviously, were much more pronounced in the fourth quarter of 2020. And specifically, as it relates to an investment gain and some income tax items, et cetera. And if you look at Page 31 in the slide presentation, you can look again at that full year view, 2020 actual versus 2021 projected or revised projection, and you'll see that we still have a little bit of an investment gain associated with charge point in that particular column around Corporate and Other. And then we'll have a little bit of pickup on the O&M front and offsetting this is going to be some increased interest expense, largely due to continuing to fund the investment program. So we have slightly higher long-term debt balances out there. Steven Fleishman : Okay. Just to verify because I just want to... Nicholas Akins : Go ahead. Go ahead, Steve. Steven Fleishman : So yes, I was just looking at the guidance you gave at EEI for 2021 and then the guidance that you're giving now for 2021. And I think the Corporate and Other is $0.08 better. So it sounds like that's mainly due to a mix of interest savings and then the charge point gains or some other things continuing? Julia Sloat : As well as some O&M pickup, yes, improvement, I should say. Steven Fleishman : That shows up in the - okay. And that's in the Corporate segment? Julia Sloat : Yes. Bingo. Yes. Steven Fleishman : Got it. Julia Sloat : Versus what we showed you at EEI. Yes. Steven Fleishman : Okay. Super helpful. And then one other question just on the SWEPCO new renewable megawatts. Do you have a sense how much of those you are going to be able to own? Are those all owned? Are some of those maybe PPA? Or how do we know the mix... Nicholas Akins : Yes. We would certainly like to own as much of that as possible because I think it's really important for - from a capital structure perspective and these companies to be well funded and have a firm foundation within the states we serve. We feel like that these generation resources, particularly the renewable resources need to be vested within the operating company. So we'll continue that approach. And that - those are the filings that we'll make. And obviously, some portion of it may wind up being PPAs, but I think we have to get the message across that it's important to the vitality of the operating companies and the operating utilities in these states that we continue to flourish from a capital standpoint. And so I think, obviously, too, the weather events in SPP demonstrate that - and I'm going to be probably testifying again on this pretty soon. But I really think it's important for the utility to have a view of what Generation looks like in these particular events, and the interaction and interoperability of these resources with the transmission and distribution system is incredibly important. I started my career in - as an electrical engineer and system operations, and I went through an ice storm, and actually, I'll tell my age now, it was 1984. But mills were tripping with coal, pipeline was freezing, valves were freezing, all these activities were occurring, and it was our ability to redispatch and utilize the ties and those kinds of things that were important for us to be able to manage through that crisis. And that's why I think it's important for there to be control features in place and from an ownership perspective, be able to focus on ensuring those benefits for our customers. You look at even some of the coal-fired generation that was in place that mitigated some of the impact from a fuel cost perspective going forward with natural gas prices going up so much. So there's a reason for each part the portfolio, and I think it's important for the utility to be the party that runs those particular facilities. So that's my view. And certainly, we'll go into these cases with a firm view toward that. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Jeremy Tonet : I just wanted to start off with - on O&M, if I could? Just wanted to see what you guys are seeing there? Because it seems like it's a nice little step down even versus what you guys had at EEI there. And just wondering, if you could provide a bit more color what you see now versus then? And really, the durability of those savings, as you think about 2022 plus, just sticking around all these cost savings that you're pulling out? Julia Sloat : Yes. This is Julie. Thanks so much for the question. Yes, O&M was a nice benefit to us in 2020. And we're going to try to hang on to as much of that and maybe a little bit more for 2021, as you can see in our forecast. So the things that we're looking to, would be things that are not only onetime in nature, but then obviously sustainable and try to take the learnings that we were able to glean from the pandemic really and how we had to operate in different ways. So things that we're talking about include things like data analytics, automation, digital tools, drone usage, outsourcing, workforce planning and then other related items, essentially, those types of things that I mentioned in my kind of preamble at the beginning of the call here. So reducing nonessential travel and training. I mean we've been able to be very successful in a virtual format. So that actually brings a fair amount of cost savings into the pocket as well, reduce materials and supplies to the extent that we can continue to rein in on advertising, minimizing overtime, et cetera. So we're looking at this from more of a sustainability or sustainable perspective, and we'll see what else we can kind of pull out of the hat in terms of additional learnings as we go forward. So it's a little bit of everything. So I can't particularly point you at one thing. And in fact, it's a variety of the entire team pooling together to be able to make this stuff come to fruition. And the track records there, we've been able to do it. So we're going to continue to turn the crank. Jeremy Tonet : That's very helpful. And maybe just pivoting over towards the renewables. I think you mentioned 10 gigawatts of wind and solar generation in regulated states by 2030, you're looking to add there. And just wondering, if you could provide a bit more color on where you think that could fall out jurisdiction wise? It seems like SWEPCO has a good focus here. Just wondering where else you might be seeing the potential over that time frame? Nicholas Akins : Yes. That's a number that continues to be in play, obviously. We originally had - I think it was like 7,500, 8,000 megawatts of renewables last time we showed and then adding the 2,400 gets to 10,000 or so. And then as we further update this analysis, like I said, by our first quarter earnings you'll see more renewables being placed in as well. So I think it is a work in progress. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. Okay. We'll stay tuned there. And just last one, if I could. Post the elections here, just wondering Biden's plan for 2035, if that impacts you directly? And also with the new FERC - ahead of FERC here, just wondering what that could mean on the transmission side if you see kind of more supportive actions there and what opportunities that could bring to AEP? Nicholas Akins : Yes, I think we'll see - continue to see supportive actions by FERC-related transmission because obviously, the build-out necessary to support renewables and clean energy is something that the Biden administration is taking on. And I'd be highly surprised if there's any let up on that. As a matter of fact, they're probably more aggressive than what the industry feels like they can do at this point. But certainly, in order to do that and aggressively meet the kind of targets that are being placed out there, transmission will play a critical role and that means AEP. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Durgesh Chopra : So just, Julie, real quick, I just want to make sure I have this right. The storm - the last week's storm-related costs, I think when you add those numbers up between PSO and SWEPCO, roughly north of $1 billion, $1.2 billion, call it, the financing plan, the interest-related charges. Are those incorporated into your 2021 guidance numbers? Julia Sloat : Not yet. No. And so we have not yet updated our financing plan. We're actually holding tight just a bit here until we get a little more clarity on exactly how this stuff is going to roll out, and we have firming up of all those numbers. As I mentioned, we made an application at the commission in Oklahoma. So that's another piece of that as well, and we will update you as we continue to move forward and make those crystallized plans for you. But as I mentioned, what you can largely anticipate is taking on a little bit more debt. Obviously, you're picking up on that with the increased potential interest expense. And obviously looking to be able to be sensitive to the customer needs, as they try to absorb this cost, but then also managing the balance sheet and the metrics that we really need to have to stay at that Baa2 stable type rating and arrangement. Durgesh Chopra : Got it. Okay. Understood. So I guess maybe just in terms of the interest charges and other things, looks like, at least, near term, you're going to borrow debt. Is there a sort of plan to offset that with O&M or other savings in the business? Julia Sloat : Yes. Yes. As a matter of fact, there are a couple of things that I'd point out. Number one, we're always going to work to mitigate any potential unforeseen risk, right? So plan do check, adjust as we move through the dynamic year. And the other thing that you may recall, me making a statement about, specifically, in my opening comments here, that application that we made at - for PSO in Oklahoma, specifically called out the fact that we were looking for a regulatory asset with a mechanism that included a WACC. And so that's incredibly important to us as well. I know Nick made the comment several times through his opening comments regarding making sure that our balance sheet metrics are intact. Having a WACC helps us do that because we need to be able to preserve the financial integrity of the operating companies as well as the entire enterprise. So those are the things that we'll be looking at. It's early. Yes. It's early. Durgesh Chopra : Understood. Understood. And then just 1 quick follow-up on the Ohio rate case - Ohio settlement discussions on the rate case there. The March 4, is that the drop-dead date or can that be extended? Nicholas Akins : Yes. It can be extended. But obviously, everyone is sort of geared towards March 4, but it could be extended. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: So Nick, maybe to start here. You seem passionate about it, and I'm quite curious. I mean you guys have a footprint that stretches RTOs here. How do you think about what reforms and weatherization looks like here? And how that could impact your capital budget? I hear your comments about reserve margins, et cetera, I was just curious if you can elaborate a little bit further? What are your lessons learned from 2014 and 1984 here, as you see them being applied perhaps in Texas holistically? And especially as you see your specific dialogues kicking off whether in Texas, or frankly, the other adjacent states as well? Nicholas Akins : Yes. So in 2014, I really testified over 3 issues. One was capacity markets and understanding the value of capacity and certainly 24/7 baseload generation. But also the second part of it was the - at that point in 2014, it was the dash to gas. And then was gas and renewables, if we're going to depend upon natural gas for substantial part supply in this country, then we really have to reinforce the ability for natural gas to perform during these types of events. And that means someone's going to have to be able to pay for it and markets will have to compensate generators for those kinds of investments. And then for the utility system itself, it really is around infrastructure to support resiliency and hardening of the system. And also, one of the other areas, I talked about in 2014, was how quickly we retire units and what the replacements of those are and how we're changing the nature of the generation mix and those have different factors associated with the planning and operation of the grid. So those are critical areas where I think for really, if I were to opine on Texas, it'd be more around market reform to support weatherization, market reform around communications that exist during crisis times because it's important for operators to know and even T&D operators to know where the generation is coming from to make adjustments from a transmission and distribution standpoint. And so when you think about some of these opportunities that exist for us, it seems projects, on the seams of the RTOs, is particularly important to have interchange capability. Now for Texas, it may be more DC ties, it could be - well, obviously, it could be more transmission in general, but Texas will have to decide that. But I think there's opportunities for more levels of interchange, more ability to put infrastructure in place to support weatherization and then market changes to support the ability for capacity to be valued the way it should be based upon its contribution to the total grid. So those are key points that continue, and really, we sort of see - let me - with California, you sort of see the same thing. I mean they're depending on heavy level of imports from out of state. If out of state has issues, then they have issues internal, within the state. So when you think about all those things, I think the planning and the optimization of what occurs is going to really carry the day in terms of our ability to better take care of these types of situations. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. Excellent. And if I could just quickly could clarify your earlier comments here? To quote you, I think you used the expression, \"no time for half measures and talk is over.\" Can you elaborate a little bit on the timing there, just as you think about it? And obviously, you're already moving, is probably a question for Brian more than Nick. But what's the timing of this, just to make sure we're on the same page here? Whatever it... Nicholas Akins : Yes. I think you have to see those decisions start this year because when you think about - I think what's crystallized for us is really the path that we're taking. We're moving to a clean energy future. We need to be able to move from a regulatory standpoint to ensure that we're achieving the balance sheet capacity to do the things that need to be done for the transition and the optimization of the grid, and I think it's really important for us to be able to manage internally, not only from an OEM perspective, but also our assets, with generally what the assets are that contribute to not only an improved return for our investors, but also in terms of optimization of the business itself. So that will be part of the path because you have 2 - you really have 2 - maybe 3 forcing functions, but, one of those is the movement to a clean energy economy, the other is the capital structure and balance sheet of the company and then the third is really focused on those 2 objectives, but ensuring that we're moving forward with infrastructure development and grid development to support resiliency and reliability of the grid. Those things, together, along with electrification, I think, are really going to be tailwinds for this industry going forward, but in particular, AEP is the largest transmission provider, we have a large distribution footprint and we have a significant amount, as I said in the last earnings call, we were on the precipice of clean energy transformation. So a lot of opportunity for AEP. We just need to make sure we manage all those throttles to ensure that we're consistently driving forward. Operator : Next, we will go to the line of James Thalacker with BMO Capital Markets. James Thalacker : Julie addressed some of the asset rotation to mitigate your financing needs. But yes, Nick, it's been a while since you've kind of, I guess, updated how you're thinking about how you prioritize growth via the different channels that are in front of you. I mean, obviously, Chuck's working on the nonregulated side on renewables, and you've got plenty of opportunities of regulated growth on the renewable side transmission. Just wondering like how are you thinking about inorganic growth maybe on the regulated side? Or how are you prioritizing sort of all those different opportunities in front of you? Nicholas Akins : Yes. So obviously, our priorities are around transmission, distribution infrastructure, certainly, on the regulated transformation of the resources that are ongoing. Chuck's business is really with AEP Energy and so forth. They've done a great job of managing risk around that business, but they've also done a great job in terms of their allocation of capital and being able to manage it, not only within their own part of the business, but also in total - the entire enterprise. So Chuck is more than willing to turn capital over, if it's a better use anywhere else in the corporation and vice versa. But we like for that business to be less than 10% of the overall business. So - and it continues to track that. And it gives us the ability to, not only further optimize that business, and you're seeing continued - really continued opportunities on that part of the business with AEP OnSite Partners on special relationships with customers around resources that really drive tremendous benefit for us because we can also approach that on the regulated side as well. So I think there's an opportunity there. But certainly, our focus is ensuring that we're able to move forward with this clean energy transformation and all the optimization around the grid and the grid resiliency and the issues there and do it in a very pragmatic way. That means we're going to have to make sure that whoever is progressing better from that perspective, that's where the equity is going to go, and we need to ensure that we're managing that portfolio in that fashion. So we can now look at this business like it's a fully regulated business, and we can make decisions based upon - there obviously are things that we look at, like, what's the quality of the service territory? What's the quality of the regulatory environment? What's the ongoing view of valuation of any particular entity for us, for someone else? And what that means in terms of rotation of capital in terms of optimization? So we are continuing that approach. And I would say that we said in the past that if we - for all of our utilities, if we see the ability to continue sustainable growth and quality growth in those jurisdictions, they make a lot of sense to us. And then, of course, we have to look at also those that are challenged and understand what those challenges are, can we erase those challenges? Are they systemic challenges? Those are the kinds of things we have to look at, and we'll continue to do that, and that's what Brian is doing. James Thalacker : Okay. Great. And just I guess, just 1 last follow-up on that because I know we're running up on time here. But I mean, when you look at like all the opportunities like you just rolled out another 2,400 megawatts of renewables. Transmission has always been something you've had plenty of opportunities, too. Like do you still look at those opportunities like where you can put earning assets in that like 1x rate base as your best opportunities? Or do you see, as you look across the landscape, like inorganic, maybe M&A or regulated properties or something that makes sense? Or is it just better to kind of stick to your point in the jurisdictions where you see the growth, it's visible, and you've got a good regulatory sort of opportunity to achieve your goals? Nicholas Akins : Yes. I think our primary focus is due to 1x. And with the organic growth that's occurred and that's really why the previous question about whether we want to own the renewable assets or not? The question is, if we own those renewable assets and that gives us more capacity to be able to invest and we can take full advantage of tax benefits and other things that enable us to continue to organically grow. And as I said earlier, we have a very high threshold for M&A because we do feel like that we have plenty of opportunities. We just have to manage the portfolio in a way that optimizes that going forward. And so that's the way we sort of think about it. And then from an M&A perspective, it has to be strategic, it has to be accretive for shareholders, it has to be something that really produces strategic benefit for us in some fashion of what we're trying to do. But again, that's a high threshold. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Weisel with Scotiabank. Andrew Weisel : Thanks for all the good detail on renewables. I just want to dig into 1 or 2 relative to your CapEx outlook. You mentioned the incremental capacity at SWEPCO, and then you mentioned that you'll do an AEP-wide regulated renewable plan in the coming months. Would a lot of that be incremental to the $37 billion? I know a lot of the spending will probably come after 2025, but do you think of that as upside to the plan? Nicholas Akins : Yes. We would - it's early to tell, but we would like it to be incremental. So we'll be working to help support that. And obviously, as you said, some of its 2025, some of its 2028. So as we progress, we want to make sure, okay, if cash flow increases, load continues to improve, optimization of capital deployed makes a lot of - has a lot of benefit associated with that, then there's a lot of parts in the puzzle, sort of like when we did North Central, we didn't know what the financing plan for that was and we continued to focus on that one. And then we'll also continue to focus on trying to make sure that they are seen as incremental. That's our focus. So whether we have to obviate some of that with the redeployment of capital or not remains to be seen, but the target is for it to be incremental. Andrew Weisel : Okay. Great. And then on the RFP at SWEPCO, you mentioned that you'd prefer to own those assets. Do you plan to bid in from the contracted renewables business as well as from the regulated utility? Nicholas Akins : Well, from the contracted renewables business - our contracted renewables business are maybe rules associated with that. But just like with North Central, we did sort of a turnkey-type thing that really allows us to time the recovery with the investment itself. That's always sort of a preferred opportunity for us because it really is handled well from a financial standpoint and also handled well from a risk standpoint relative to the construction and customers, the risk to customers as well. So I think we probably stick with something like that and whether our contracted business is on the back end or not is another question. I mean, obviously, we don't really care if it's our contracted business or someone else as long as at the end of the day, we wind up owning it. Andrew Weisel : Yes. Got it. That makes sense. Then one last one, just to clarify. I think you said you still want that contracted renewables to be capped at about 10% of the company, did I hear you right? And given the overall growing demand for renewables across the country and support out of DC, does that mean that you'll be more selective in your projects or look for higher returns at lower risk? How do you think about that dynamic? Nicholas Akins : Yes. No. Yes, that's exactly right. We've always managed that business around higher returns. We want to be commensurate on a levered basis with our regulated businesses. And we will continue - as a matter of fact, we turn away a lot more projects than what we actually move forward with. And as you probably have seen, I guess, it seems to get more aggressive all the time about what the return levels are. And it's really - the difference is really what people say at the end of a contract, what that terminal value is. And we really don't want to get into that kind of war. We really focus on those relationships with customers and developers that help us move forward with very positive projects, and that's the way we'll continue to look at that business. And then OnSite Partners and others with specific customer-related issues, like, for example, here in Columbus, we have several businesses that we have signed up for a joint renewables project that we continue to focus on, and we do aggregation of customers in Columbus, which was approved by a referendum vote that AEP Energy would be doing. So it's those kinds of things that we can mix and match with the - and tailor the relationship that the customer is looking for. I think that's what we are after. Julia Sloat : Just to circle back real quickly, too, if I could, just an additional comment. As it relates to that threshold in terms of business mix, there are a couple of reasons why that 10% makes sense for us. Number one, to a credit profile risk management perspective, that's very important for us. So that's something we keep top of mind. And the other is really on tax shield associated with debt. So we've got a couple of things that we're sensitive to and just continue to high grade the earnings opportunities from our unregulated contracted renewables business. But that gives you probably a little bit more perspective if that wasn't already top of mind for you because it surely is for us. Nicholas Akins : Yes. Andrew Weisel : Okay. Very helpful. And I just want to echo the congrats to Julie and congrats to the team on another strong year. Nicholas Akins : Thank you. Julia Sloat : Thank you. Operator : Our final question will come from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Paul Patterson : So just some quick follow-up, just on the Oklahoma filing, I haven't had a chance to look at it. The - how long do you guys expect to - my understanding, if I heard you correctly, that you're asking for a weighted average cost of capital. I was wondering how long do you expect to have the - how long will it take to amortize the asset, I guess, with your filings? Julia Sloat : Yes. Well, actually, we haven't been prescriptive in our filings. So we've got a little flexibility there. And so that's another reason why I kind of mentioned, we're thinking about any potential financing in the interim and how that would map to any potential outcome there. I do know that one of our peer companies out in Oklahoma made a similar filing, and I believe that it was 10 years on theirs as well as a WACC to give you a kind of perspective, but we want to be sensitive to customer bills as well as I'm sure you can imagine. Paul Patterson : Okay. Sure. And when do you think we'll get some sort of feedback from the commission? Julia Sloat : Probably a couple of months. I don't have a time line yet. Paul Patterson : Sure. It's all early. Julia Sloat : Yes. Paul Patterson : And then just on - a really quick one on APCo. As I recall, you guys were granted rehearing in the - yes, the case. And you guys are also currently filing an appeal, and I was just - if you could elaborate a little bit more on that? Because I thought there wasn't a decision on - okay. Nicholas Akins : Yes. That's right. Yes, we did file for rehearing, and it was granted and the parties are filing briefs and it stands with the commission. But also, we filed in the Virginia Supreme Court. So - because we're not wasting any time. Paul Patterson : Okay. Okay. So just to sort of understand it procedurally, do you expect to get sign from the Supreme Court before the commission or the commission, I would think, normally before the Supreme Court? Nicholas Akins : Yes. It's normally the commission before the Supreme Court. But obviously, we feel like it's such an important issue and a focus on what we believe state law says as they - it's important for the Supreme Court to resolve that issue in case the commission doesn't. Paul Patterson : Okay. And do you know when would the commission might come out? Or any - is there a schedule on that? Or is it just whenever they want to? Nicholas Akins : Yes. I think it's whenever they want. Operator : And speakers, do you have any closing comments? Julia Sloat : We do. Thank you for joining us on today's call. As always, the IR team will be available to answer any additional questions you may have. Cynthia, would you please give the replay information? Operator : Certainly.

As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Ms. Darcy Reese, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Darcy Reese : Thank you, Tony. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the First Quarter 2021 Earnings Call for American Electric Power. We appreciate you taking time today to join us today. Our earnings release, presentation slides and related financial information are available on our website at aep.com. Nick Akins : Thanks, Darcy, and welcome again everyone to American Electric Power's first quarter 2021 earnings call and happy Earth Day. Before I get started with our results for the quarter, I just have to say, I was struck with the public relations - public reactions to the Chauvin verdict. It has been a long wait, but justice and faith in our legal system does prevail. I bring this up because it happens, I had chosen a song, which I do every quarter as you know for a different reason, but now it serves two purposes. One, the most mesmerizing singer as I'd ever heard was the late Marvin Gaye. I thought of his song when actually thinking about our quarter and the multitude of activities that AEP continues to accomplish and was thinking of what's going on the Marvin Gaye hit from 1971 written during another tumultuous time in America. This song was a plea for peace, justice and understanding perspectives to move forward in a positive way together. As I said, this song was released in 1971, 50 years ago, but it could not be more appropriate today. We need our leaders, our communities and indeed, our companies to continue to come together and stop the divisiveness, which the new cycle tends to feed off of and recognized we have a lot more in common than are differences, that would be a great start to advancing this nation in a positive way. That being said, getting to my original purpose, as I said earlier, what's going on with AEP as the lyrics say, hey, man, what's happening, whoo, everything is everything. We're going to do a get down today, why I tell you. So here we go, the first quarter of 2021 came in with operating earnings of $1.15 per share versus $1.02 for first quarter '20, which met our expectations particularly given impact in Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana and Oklahoma, which we reported on in last quarter's earnings call. AEP continues to reaffirm our 2021 guidance range of $4.55 to $4.75 per share and our 5% to 7% long-term growth rate, and we would still be disappointed not to be in the upper half of the guidance range. Julia Sloat : Thanks, Nick, and thanks, Darcy. It's good to be with everyone this morning. I'm going to walk us through the financial results for the quarter, share some thoughts on our service territory load and economy, and then finish with a review of our credit metrics and liquidity. So let's go to Slide 7, which shows the comparison of GAAP to operating earnings for the quarter. GAAP earnings were $1.16 per share compared to $1 per share in 2020. There is a reconciliation of GAAP to operating earnings on Page 15 of the presentation today. Let's walk through our quarterly operating earnings performance by segment, this is laid out on Slide 8. Operating earnings for the first quarter totaled $1.15 per share or $571 million compared to $1.02 per share or $504 million in 2020. Looking at the drivers by segment, operating earnings for the Vertically Integrated Utilities were $0.54 per share, up $0.04, driven by the favorable impact of weather due to warmer than normal winter temps in 2020. Other favorable items in this segment included Off-system sales, higher transmission revenue and the impact of rate changes across multiple jurisdictions, partially offsetting these favorable items were higher depreciation, lower normalized retail load, higher O&M, a prior period fuel adjustment and higher other taxes. The Transmission and Distribution Utilities segment earned $0.23 per share, down $0.01 from last year. Earnings in this segment declined primarily due to lower normalized retail load attributable in part to storm Uri. Other smaller decreases included higher depreciation, tax and O&M expenses. Favorable drivers in this segment included transmission revenue, rate changes and weather. The AEP Transmission Holdco segment continued to grow, contributing $0.35 per share, an improvement of $0.07 per share from last year. Net plant increased by $1.3 billion or 13% since March of last year. Generation and Marketing produced $0.06 per share, down $0.01 from last year. The favorable impact of the retirement of OCA Union and land sales on the generation business offset the unfavorable ERCOT market prices on the wholesale business during storm Uri in February. The decrease in the renewables business was driven by lower energy margins and higher expenses. Finally, Corporate and Other was up $0.04 per share, driven by an investment gain and lower interest expense, partially offsetting these items was the higher impact of - impact of higher taxes. Overall, we experienced a solid quarter and we're confident in reaffirming our annual operating earnings guidance. So let's take a look at our normalized load for the quarter on Page 9. Starting on the lower right corner, our first quarter normalized load came in 1.9% below the first quarter of 2020. There are two important factors to consider when evaluating the year-over-year comparison for the quarter. The first factor is that last year included an extra leap year day assuming everything else equal, you would expect about a 1% decline in sales due to one lesser day in the quarter, and the second factor is that the pandemic started during the last two weeks of the 2021st quarter. In other words, the first quarter analysis is comparing a pre-pandemic view of our service territory load to have you after COVID began. Importantly, we still expect a stronger recovery in the second half of this year as vaccinations increased positioning more communities to relax restrictions on businesses without jeopardizing public health and as a benefit of the American Rescue Plan stimulus, it was signed in late March, works its way through the economy. I'll talk a little bit more about the latest economic projections when we get to Slide 11. So let's take a look at the upper left quadrant, our normalized residential sales increased by 1.5% in the first quarter compared to last year. The growth in the residential sales was spread across most operating companies. As the pandemic recovery progresses, growth in residential sales as begun to moderate. While we expect residential sales to decline by 1.1% in 2021, we're assuming a moderate sustained load benefit from this customer class given the stickiness of work-from-home arrangements for many office workers across our service territory for the foreseeable future. So if you go over to the right, normalized commercial sales decreased by 1.6% in the first quarter. Even though commercial sales were down across every operating company excluding Ohio, we are seeing steady sequential improvement since the pandemic began. In fact, AEP Ohio was the first operating company to post positive commercial sales growth. This correlates well with the fact that the AEP Ohio territory added the most jobs in the first quarter. We also continue to see significant improvement in the same sectors that were hardest hit by the shutdowns in the second quarter of 2020. These sectors include schools, churches, restaurants and hotels. So finally, if you look in the lower left chart, you'll see that industrial sales decreased by 6.1% in the quarter compared to 2020. Industrial sales were down across every operating company and most industrial sectors. Not surprisingly, the biggest declines were located in the western territory where storm Uri in February caused a significant yet temporary - significant yet temporary disruptions to many manufacturing facilities located in ERCOT and SPP. In addition to the numerous electric generators unable to run due to frozen natural gas supply lines, there are a number of other manufacturing processes that rely on natural gas supply to produce their product. Many of those businesses were unable to produce for up to a week while the pipelines were being out and in some cases, industrial loads were stalled as long as 42 days in Texas. So the key takeaway here is that the dip in industrial sales in the first quarter was largely due to the one-time winter storm, which does not impact our fundamental outlook. So here's an interesting data point that illustrates this, our industrial sales in the eastern part of our service territory were down 2.6% as compared to the significant 12.8% drop in the western part of our service territory, which was impacted by Uri. So obviously, that's a pretty dramatic difference. That being said, we're still very bullish about the second half of the year as the US acquires a significantly greater concentration of immunity from vaccinations and as the full impact of the additional fiscal stimulus is felt throughout the service territory economy. So let's go over to Slide 10 where I can provide a little color on the industrial sales performance in the first quarter. The blue bars show the change in sales to our oil and gas customers. In aggregate, the sales to oil and gas sectors were down 9.6% in the first quarter, led by the 21% reduction in oil and gas extraction. Most of the decline in this sector is in response to the challenging market signals from last year when the drop in global demand along with the temporary price war caused oil prices to fall below many producers' breakeven point. However, we do not expect the weakness in oil and gas to persist. In fact, natural gas prices in March were up about 60% from last year and domestic oil prices last month have more than doubled since March of 2020. We fully expect the higher prices today will provide the necessary signal that producers are looking for to increase their production within the service territory. And once we see the production increase in the upstream sectors, it's only a matter of time before we see the corresponding increase in the midstream and downstream operations. The orange bars in the chart show the change in industrial sales, excluding oil and gas. While it was still down 3.3% for the quarter, we expect to see stronger improvement in the second half of the year as the global economy recovers from the pandemic. Some of the weakness in manufacturing right now is related to supply chain disruptions. As efforts continue to strengthen the resiliency of the domestic supply chain for manufacturing, the AEP service territory is certainly positioned to benefit from any movement in that direction. So let's go over to Slide number 11 where I can provide an update that I mentioned a few moments ago on the latest economic conditions within the AEP footprint. Starting in the lower left chart or on the left chart, you'll see that AEP service territory experienced a 1.6% increase in gross regional product compared to the first quarter of 2020. This was much better than the US, which had a relatively flat first quarter in terms of year-over-year GDP growth. The AEP service territory was less impacted by the virus and had fewer restrictions on businesses than other parts of the country, which has allowed the regional economy to fare better than the US throughout the pandemic. Looking forward, the AEP service territory is expected to grow by 5.2% in 2021, lagging the economic recovery in the US as you might expect. Moving to employment on the right, you can see that the job market for the AEP service territory has also outperformed the US throughout the pandemic. For the quarter, employment growth was only down 1.6%, which was 4 points or 4% better than the US during the first quarter. This is largely the result of the mix of jobs in our local economy, which has a heavier relative concentration of manufacturing and government jobs and a smaller share of leisure and hospitality jobs. Going forward, we expect job growth of 1.7% in 2021. So let's go over to Page 12 checking on the Company's capitalization and liquidity position. On a GAAP basis, our debt to capital ratio is 62.5%. When adjusted for the Storm Uri event, the ratio remains consistent with our year-end 2020 ratio at 61.8%. Let's talk about our FFO to debt metric because as you would expect and as we've been signaling, the impact of Storm Uri has and will have a temporary and noticeable impact in 2021 on this metric. Taking a look at the upper right quadrant on this page, you see our FFO to debt metric based on the traditional Moody's and GAAP calculated basis as well as on an adjusted Moody's and GAAP calculated basis. On a traditional unadjusted basis, our FFO to debt ratio decreased by 3.9% during the quarter to 9.1% on a Moody's basis. Well, this is a pretty dramatic impact. The rating agencies are very much aware of this and have taken the metric data point as well as the anticipated recovery into consideration as it relates to our credit rating. On an adjusted basis, the Moody's FFO to debt metric is 12.9%. To be very clear, this 12.9% figure removes or adjusts the calculation to eliminate the impact of approximately $1.2 billion of cash outflows associated with covering the unplanned Uri-driven fuel and purchase power in the SPP region directly impacting PSO and SWEPCO in particular. The metric is also adjusted to remove the effect of the associated debt we used to fund the unplanned payments. This should give you a sense of where we would be from a business as usual prospectus of 12.9% business as usual. As you know, we're in frequent contact with the rating agencies to keep them apprised of all aspects of our business and importantly, there is no change in our equity financing plan. On the topic of anticipated recovery, there is no debate that Storm Uri was an extreme event and consequently, the various states would like to resolve recovery docket as expeditiously as practical. Assuming recovery begins this year, our cash flow metrics will quickly return to the low to mid-teens target range next year as expected. So this should be a one year phenomenon for us. As many of you know, we have initiated regulatory cases in our respective states to evaluate the costs and determine the recovery plan. Let me provide a quick update where we are in this process. On February 24th, PSO filed with the Commission for recovery of fuel costs through a - with a regulatory asset and weighted average cost of capital carrying charge and subsequently filed a motion seeking recovery of a $615 million regulatory asset with a five-year amortization. At this point, PSO has received approval to defer the storm-related costs, with recovery of the established regulatory asset over five years at an interim rate of PSO's short-term financing cost of like 75 basis points. This is intended to be an interim order and the actual carrying charge will determined in a future review and the regulatory asset amount is subject to finalization. Importantly, Oklahoma has also taken up a securitization bill to address the extraordinary fuel and purchase power costs felt by all utilities, PSO will evaluate as the securitization is appropriate for the recovery. And if so, we would expect it to occur as early as next year. In March, the Arkansas Public Service Commission issued an order authorizing recovery of the approximate $113 million Arkansas jurisdictional share of the retail customer fuel cost over five years, with the carrying charges to be determined at a later date and the actual amount to be recovered being subject to finalization. We requested a WACC rate, which was supported by the staff in accordance with the order, SWEPCO began recovery in this jurisdiction in April, that was at a customer deposit rate of something like 80 basis points. The recovery period and associated carrying charge will be further reviewed in a hearing that's already been set for July 8th of this year, so 2021. In March, the Louisiana Public Service Commission approved a special order granting a temporary modification to the fuel adjustment clause to allow utilities to spread recovery over a longer period of time. In April, SWEPCO begin recovery of the Louisiana jurisdictional share of these fuel costs is about $150 million based on a five-year recovery period in a fuel over under recovery mechanism. SWEPCO will be working with the Louisiana Commission to finalize the actual recovery period and determine the appropriate carrying charge. And in Texas, SWEPCO intends to file for recovery under fuel surcharge, most likely in the second quarter. Our current plan is to request recovery over five years with a WACC carrying charge. Obviously, we have a lot in process on the regulatory recovery front on this matter and we'll keep you apprised as we make progress, because as we all know this is extremely important. Let's take a quick moment to visit our liquidity summary on the lower right of Slide 12. In March - on March 31st, AEP renewed its $4 billion bank revolver for five years and also entered into a two-year $1 billion revolving credit facility to fortify our liquidity position as we go forward, just placed our net liquidity position as of March 31st at a strong $3.4 billion. Switching gears, our qualified pension funding increased 1.7% during the quarter to 103.5% and our OPEB funding increased 9.6% to 170.5%. Rising interest rates that decreased plan liabilities along with positive equity returns were the primary drivers for the funded status increases in both plans during the first quarter. So let's go to Slide 13, so we can wrap this thing up and get your questions, but I just want to call out a couple of quick things before we do that. So on top of mind for many folks I know this, we want to mention to you that we completed the planned $125 million equity funding portion of the North Central Wind Sundance project. We used our at the market mechanism, so that we could time the equity need with our purchase of the Sundance project, which occurred last week. As you know, we will continue to move forward with additional opportunities in the renewable space supporting our ESG focus as we transition toward a clean energy future. Our performance in the first quarter and stability of our regulated business model gives us the confidence to reaffirm our operating earnings guidance range of $4.55 per share to $4.75 per share. Because of our ability to continue to invest in our own system organically, we are confident in our ability to grow the Company at our stated long-term growth rate of 5% to 7%. So we surely do appreciate your time and attention today. And with that, I'm going to turn the call over to the operator for your questions. Operator :  Our first question comes from the line of Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead. Nick Akins : Good morning, Shar. Shar Pourreza : Good morning, guys. Good morning, Nick. Good morning, everyone. Julia Sloat : Good morning. Shar Pourreza : So the - couple of quick questions here. First on the incremental 8.6 gigs of renewable opportunities, which just added to plan. It's very sizable - maybe touch a little bit on how we should think about these new opportunities in light of the 5% to 7% growth that you gave, what sort of financing avenues were you kind of looking at the approval tariffs and what are you assuming in terms of owned versus PPA? Nick Akins : Yeah, I think we have - the last part - last part of your question first. I think we have a pretty compelling argument now for owners of these facilities given even past the winter storm activity that we learned operationally, certainly what we learned from the - really this the provisions of the agreements that we put in place relative to the approvals really stands better in terms of our ability to manage the project, manage congestion, manage other factors that really provide benefits to our customers. So we're going to make a strong position that we should own those assets and actually when you think about the strength of the utilities, it's going to be important for the states to really focus on how do we keep our utilities strong and PPAs don't do it from a capital structure perspective. We need to make sure that ownership and their flexibility of operations is key in that regard. And regarding the other, 8600 megawatts, yeah, it is a sizable number, but obviously when you look at the evaluation of the retirements, when you look at the needs of the operating companies and also North Central certainly showed, you can deploy capital and reduce the overall bills to consumers. So when you think about the retirements of coal-fired generation, the imposition of additional transmission, having the benefits of the fuel cost aspects of it are tremendously important. So when you look at the analysis having some level of carbon pricing in there certainly increases the focus on the ability for renewables to come into play and that's certainly what we've been focusing on. So as you look at the finance ability of it, the finance ability pretty much work like we - like it did for North Central, although it is large number. So we'll have to be very aware of what our balance sheet strength looks like during the process, the timing of when the different tranches of these renewables come into play, the cash position that supported with these projects coming online and being able to improve as Julia mentioned. This FFO to debt thing where it is today is really a 2021 issue. In 2022, FFO to debt comes back up and certainly with the ability to put these projects in place, it will help in terms of our ability to continue to fund these projects. So it will probably - we've certainly would like for it all to be incremental, but in reality when you go through this process, it will probably be around capital allocation and prioritization associated with that within the existing plan, but also incremental. So it'd be a combination of both. Yet to be seen, obviously if load continues to grow, if the position relative to the regulatory framework getting concurrent recovery, making sure that we get off the tax ADIT issues, that's all going to be helpful in terms of our ability to finance. So it's still a work in progress. Shar Pourreza : Got it. And then maybe just transitioning to corporate strategy and asset optimization, obviously, the strategic review for Kentucky is started, so Brian has been obviously very busy year, can we maybe just elaborate on the phase we are in with that process has - have bidders emerge or data rooms opened and assuming this would backfill most of your Wind Catcher equity need. So assuming we are looking at a Duke style Indiana GIC transaction for the entire OPCo. So we should obviously consider leakage share any NOLs as well that could be applicable in this case? Nick Akins : Yes, Shar, you are always ahead in terms of questions. Yeah, and I really can't answer any of those at this point because we are in a process and certainly as soon as we have information on it, I think the real issue here is, we have made a deliberate decision to really start our portfolio management approach and evaluating jurisdictions, because we are fully regulated. We can look at these areas and determine what the best fit is in terms of future capital needs and what our focus is in terms of moving to a clean energy economy. So - and for us to come out and say that we are in a strategic process relative to Kentucky is an important statement in that regard. That's probably as far as we can go right now. Shar Pourreza : Let me ask you something a little bit more of a theoretical question, would you consider asset rotations above your current equity needs, let's say, from North Central to fund the incremental CapEx or renewables or T&D, I mean, you're within your credit metric guidance but does it make sense for you to further improve your balance sheet and simplify your store even further. I mean, do you kind of like looking at the stock valuation and does it may be more sense to - do you think there's incremental value from a multiple standpoint to even have a stronger balance sheet and operating even less states here and I'm thinking maybe Texas? Nick Akins : Well, certainly, like I said, this is at the beginning of this process, but multiple expansion is clearly on our minds and making sure that you can - you're investing in the right things at the right places at the right time is going to be incredibly important. And you saw that with North Central of timing the recovery with the actual investments with the turnkey approach that we took and it's all about the timing of it, it's all about the decisions made to ensure that we are doing proper capital allocation and rotation to manage this process forward. So - and like I said earlier, that's going to be a continuing part of our business. Shar Pourreza : Terrific. Thank you, guys. I'll jump in the queue. I appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Next, we go to the line of Julien Dumoulin Smith with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Nick Akins : Good morning, Julien. Julien Dumoulin Smith : Hey, good morning, team. Congratulations on all these updates. Nick Akins : Yeah. Julien Dumoulin Smith : A lot to digest here today, I did. If I can, let's start with a higher level question here, right. So you're proposing a lot specifically in PSO, how do you think about the events that have transpired in Texas and Uri impacting that and specifically around some intermittent resources like solar in Oklahoma, right. We just haven't seen a lot of that historically and so this is a little bit of new territory for that geography more than the economics all around. Can you talk to that and have you kind of vetted some of the proposals here and the approval process? Nick Akins : Yeah, so obviously, we're right out of the gate in terms of the announcement of what's included in each jurisdiction. So we'll have discussions with the commissions and that's part of the integrated resource planning processes and keep in mind too, when we do this evaluation during the RFP, I mean, during the process, as always solving for whatever the lease cost is in terms of what those resources are. So it shows up as win. And then solar, typically it's showing up as more wind early on and solar starts to pick up, but that's pretty fungible as you go forward. I mean, these plans will change as we go forward based upon where technologies go, certainly where the opportunities exist. Oklahoma may want more wind and less solar, but that won't matter, it'd be a part of the total renewables piece that's included there. The other part of it too is, we will be very mindful of how much renewables are placed into service in relation to 24/7 supply and there is some natural gas that's built into this plan as well that enables more renewables to be put in place, but the real focus going forward during this transitional period will be for units that provide 24/7 to be more of a reliability component, certainly more of a - sort of an insurance backstop for weather events or other events that may occur that impact the grid security and will have to be very, very mindful of how those studies actually go. And I'll tell you, in our climate report, we saw for 2050 with a $15 carbon price and then more aggressive $30 carbon price, the 2035 case didn't solve because of the timing of getting resources in place and system-related issues. So you have to really think about how that's done and we've looked at these plans and we certainly believe that was the level of 24/7 supply we still have out there and the additional opportunity associated with just the diversity of some of these projects. It's going to be of particular value to our customers going forward. And I guess, I'll just remind you that North Central, had it been operational during this time of the Texas and Oklahoma outages with the Uri would have saved customers $227 million. So you think about the savings associated with that and the other thing too, the previous question, someone was - Shar was asking, when the utilities do it, they focus on the long term and North Central already had the weather package is already in place where you don't find that in a large part of the market. So we think the long-term when we go about after these investments and that's why ownership is clearly important. Julien Dumoulin Smith : Excellent. And just to clarify this a little bit further, I know that the equity numbers aren't moving around too much, we're at all, frankly, relative to CapEx, but how much capital could be shifted given the latest updates here in the three-year versus the five-year outlook here? Just want to understand, out of the total 10-year view that you guys are providing today, how much could be in that three-year and five-year window as you think about just the specific timing of each of these dockets that will come up for renewable resources? Nick Akins : Well, yeah, as I mentioned, 10,000 of the megawatts of the 16,000 - over 16,000 is in the '21 to '25 timeframe, so it's going to be near-term. So when you think about these projects, they take a couple of years to put in place. You'll be looking more at that '23 to '25 for most of it, but some of it was - is already in play. There is already RFPs going out for suppliers of some of these renewables as we speak. Julia, anything do you want to add to that? Julia Sloat : No, you've got that perfect, thank you. Nick Akins : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Stephen Byrd : Hi, thanks guys for taking my question. Nick Akins : Good morning, Stephen. Stephen Byrd : Good morning. Congrats on a great update and a big movement in renewables, so happy to see that. I wanted - if you could just talk a little bit more about as you grow out renewables, whether there might be some additional transmission distribution requirements or stores there just other things that would sort of be additive as well, it's obviously just huge amount of megawatts, just curious about the other impacts? Nick Akins : Yeah, there will be and many of these projects, obviously, we'll have to look at the placement of these projects as in the level of congestion, but also the level of transmission investment that's required. But keep in mind too with the Biden administrations doing relative to the movement to clean energy, which obviously is a big part of his plan, large scale transmission will also be incredibly important. So, I see with what's going on today and in excess of all these things coming together, our transmission which you've always said is, as far as I can see for a decade, well, it's probably even higher. We don't know what that number is at this point and I think we've got to get through the process and fully understand that, but when you do the net benefits associated with fuel and the capital cost of the renewables projects and transmission, it's still a benefit to consumers. So, we'll go through that process, but you're right to be bullish about transmission in relation to these investments, but also everyone else's investments because we are the largest transmission provider in the country and most of this has to come through us. Stephen Byrd : That's really helpful. And then I wanted to drill into Texas for just a moment. There are some bills as you know that are floating around that would permit securitization of costs and those look to be, I guess to me, quite helpful from a financing point of view, just curious how you're thinking about that impact, how might that impact your thoughts on financing? I appreciate the point you raised earlier that essentially the credit metrics are sort of artificially low at the moment because of the storm, but with some of this - some of these bills be especially helpful to you? Nick Akins : Well, certainly the ERCOT portion of Texas, we are essentially a large company there at T&D. So, and we have, based on our cost provisions in place for recovery of that, we - the only real exposure we've got from a standpoint is any, I guess some of the reps, they could potentially go bankrupt and - but that's where it's going to be important to understand where that goes and also as far as securitization is concerned, we view securitization in the past in Texas and you're seeing it develop for what's classified of storm caused, but it really is Uri-related investments we'd be fine with that. Julia, anything... Julia Sloat : No, that would be great. Great question, Stephen. So, we're keeping an eye on what's going on in Oklahoma. There is an opportunity potentially to engage in some securitization activity there, would love to get cash in the door. So if that's something that's workable, we will absolutely take the cash and my understanding is, the way that is being at least they initially discussed it and potentially structured would be such - in such a way that that does not sit on our balance sheet, which makes it even better. So, yes, we'll take that cash and with no doubt on the balance sheet, we like that very much. So, we are definitely poised and ready and waiting. Stephen Byrd : That's great. Maybe one last quick one, just as we think about this growth in renewables, any changes in terms of your thoughts on coal retirement dates? Nick Akins : Well, obviously the move we made on the second Rockport Unit solidified at least at 2028 and it could occur earlier depend on what the conditions are and what the evaluations are with the commission and the replacements of capacity. And so, we are - and actually, we're looking for provisions like that even in legislation that's occurring, because you're seeing all kinds of incentives developed for extension of PTCs, ITCs, direct pay we like, so direct pay not only for renewables projects, but also for transmission. If you have an ITC, but I think also, we'd like to see incentives for the undepreciated plant balances of coal units to further accelerate the ability to retire and obviate the impact to our customers. But the current plan does assume any of these advancements so - and this happens all the time where we have plans that are out there that are public, but lot of things get worked on and we'll continue to work on these objectives, because our objective is to move as quickly as possible to derisk these investments, particularly with new environmental rules with CCR and other things. We're making decisions about these plants and you've seen the last two quarters, we've announced earlier retirements of coal and lignite plant operation. So I would fully expect to see that process to continue. Stephen Byrd : Very good. Thank you very much. Nick Akins : Yeah. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Steve Fleishman : Yeah, thanks. Good morning, Nick and team. Nick Akins : Good morning, Steve. How are you doing? Steve Fleishman : I'm doing well. I have a couple of questions on the Kentucky Power announcement. Nick Akins : Yeah. Steve Fleishman : So just I think, Nick, you said that you're doing a strategic review with a target for year-end. So, is that the target to basically have a sales done and proceeds by year-end or have a kind of like a sale or other plan announced by year-end? Nick Akins : Steve, so, I didn't say year-end. I said we would get the evaluation done in 2021, that could be earlier in the year, it could be later in the year. Obviously, we need to get farther down the road in terms of this process. I can tell you that the process is established, it's ongoing and we're going to move as quickly as possible. So - and we've always talked about the timing of the resolution of anything related to the weather was Kentucky or anything else in relation to the needs around North Central. So, and we still believe that timing fits. Steve Fleishman : Okay, that's helpful. Nick Akins : So, I wasn't saying that would be the end of the year before we know anything, I just said during '21. Steve Fleishman : Okay. And just, is there kind of - this may be, it seems silly, but just, is there a reason that this wasn't like part of your slide deck or release or just - it was just stated on the call, just - it's something just happened, the Board just decide something? Nick Akins : No, I think it was out of respect to our employees, because obviously, you can't say something like this from an SEC perspective without some thought around that, but also there is the human aspects of it too and employee aspects. Matter of fact, our employees just found out about it. When I've said it, I have a webcast after this with all employees to talk about this to just alleviate their concerns through the process, but this is the way that occurs, there is multiple things you have to think about when you're making these kinds of announcements. Steve Fleishman : Understood. And then just in terms of - that's helpful. So in terms of the - in terms of thinking about your financing, this would still be potentially directed at replacing the equity needs that you have currently for North Central as a potential replacement for some of that it will be? Nick Akins : Yeah, I'll let Julia talk about that. Julia Sloat : Steve, yeah, thank you for the question. Absolutely, to the extent that we get dollars in the door, that will be a wonderful place to put that to work in terms of being able to sidestep some of the equity need and we'll see if we can make that happen, absolutely. Nick Akins : We have the that we've access, but obviously it would change the nature of that. Steve Fleishman : One challenge with Kentucky Power has a lot of coal plants and exposure I guess, so to speak, just, do you feel like there is still despite that decent interest to be able to monetize at a reasonable price? Nick Akins : Yeah, and obviously different parties look at in different ways and that's what we're going to find out and through the strategic process is what evaluation Kentucky's ownership of Mitchell in terms of valuation and its impact on overall price would be. It still has value, it's still has years to operate and certainly, if you look at the plan that we presented, you still have a potential renewables opportunity there, particularly with the potential retirement of Mitchell at some point. So, anyone who is looking at this, I would say, it's not - in terms of just the valuation of Mitchell, it's a evaluation of what you do with it during the transition. So there's a lot of things to look at from that perspective. Steve Fleishman : And my last question just on this topic and my last question is just, the overall portfolio optimization kind of that you've been doing, is this a conclusion of that or is this something where we could get more? Nick Akins : No, it's going to be an ongoing part of our process. So it's just the beginning. Steve Fleishman : Great. That's helpful. Thank you very much. Nick Akins : Yeah, okay. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of the Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Nick Akins : Good morning, Durgesh. Durgesh Chopra : Hey, good morning, Nick. Thank you for taking my question. Just I have - I think you've covered the rest, just on storm costs, Julia, you're currently deferring those, right, the $1.2 billion on the balance sheet, can you just reminded us... Julia Sloat : Yeah... Durgesh Chopra : Thank you. Can you just remind us what is factored into your 2021 guidance, I'm just thinking about how the sort of the regulatory decisions here in the next few months impact your 2021 numbers? Julia Sloat : Yeah, absolutely. You have it exactly right. We're deferring those storm costs, particularly as it relates to the fuel and purchase power costs, because that's the biggest chunk of the dollars that we had exposure to as it relates to storm in Uri in particular. And as it relates to what's embedded in our guidance, I would tell you, we actually updated our cash flow forecast. That's included in the slide deck that you have today to incorporate the impact of this particular circumstance as well as the fact that we did have some ice storms and more I'd characterize more kind of normal storm-related activities that occurred in the eastern portion of our jurisdictions here during the first quarter. So all of that is factored into those new cash flow forecast details, which you'll see impacting the cash flow from operations line in the slide included in the deck today. As you know, we did take on some additional debt to be able to accommodate the fuel and purchase power spike that was not anticipated and so that is now being absorbed into our 2021 operations and therefore into our earnings. Interestingly, if you look at Page number 8 of the slide deck that we have out there today, on the Corporate and Other segment, you'll actually see that interest expense was a benefit to us this time despite the fact that we have taken on a little additional debt in that capacity, because we took a $500 million term loan on at the parent company interest rates - in terms of interest cost I should say, was much lower in this particular quarter versus last year. We do have - still have lower debt outstanding from a short-term perspective versus last year. So all of those factors, interestingly, helped to have this impact to be one of benefit to us in this particular period. So, steady as she goes, no change in forecast, still feeling really good about where we are. Hopefully that helps you a little bit. Durgesh Chopra : It does. It does a nutshell. It's captured in your EPS guidance, interest costs and the cash flow metrics already reflect the sort of the some of the treatment you might get in terms of recovery for these costs. Julia Sloat : You've got it. We did that by design because we wanted to make sure we had a fair amount of integrity in that forecast with - particularly when you look at the cash flow metrics and give a shout out to our fixed income friends because I know that's extremely important. Durgesh Chopra : Understood, thanks. Just one last one for me. Nick, you mentioned the disappointing first quarter, it's just what to look forward there in terms of next steps, is there going to be a rulemaking procedure and just next steps there, what should we be looking for there? Nick Akins : Yeah, there it is open for right now. So, and obviously our comments will be very direct and very focused, and I'm sure there'll be others in the industry with that as well, but it just seems like a direct polar opposite to where the administration is trying to go with movement to a clean energy economy and really it is directly opposite to years of precedents of encouraging the development of transmission. So I'm certainly hopeful as we get through the dialog of what this all means and actually with RTO participation, when we originally joined the RTO years ago, we were making a lot of money off of through an outrates of transmission. We traded that in for generation benefits, because we were selling a lot of generation. We're not selling generation, so to any real extent and certainly when you look at the value proposition of an RTO, it is centered on the ability to optimize across a larger jurisdiction. But from an AEP perspective, you got the cost of the RTO and certainly, our customers need to be able to benefit from that. So if you disrupt that net cost benefit opportunity, you will have people making different decisions about RTO participation. So I think it's just sort of a policy move in the wrong direction, but certainly and hopeful that the commission comes together on that. Durgesh Chopra : Understood. Is there a timeline as to when the common period ends and when they might make a final determination yet? Nick Akins : I don't know that there is right now, they have to post the noper in the Federal Register first. So we're thinking probably a summer timeframe for the noper. Durgesh Chopra : Understood. Thank you. Appreciate the color. Nick Akins : Yeah. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Weisel with Scotiabank. Please go ahead. Nick Akins : Good morning, Andrew. Andrew Weisel : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I appreciate late in the call here. First, just to follow up on the transmission, are you able to provide an EPS sensitivity or potential impact if that RTO incentive adder would it be eliminated? Nick Akins : Yeah, we had in our queue, actually, the number for our evaluation that we lost the entire 50 basis points, it would amount to $55 million to $70 million pre-tax. So - and that's the evaluation now and who knows what they're going to do because you went in the meeting thinking they may actually go up on the RTO incentive, but they remains to be seen what they decide to do, but that's the impact. Andrew Weisel : Well, that was the next thing I was going to ask, do you see any potential of an increase or do you think that's, it's a highly improbable at this point? Nick Akins : I think certainly with what transpired, we're just trying to make sure it stays the same, but if it increases, there's a lot of reasons for it to increase because RTO participation and the adders associated with transmission, like I said, the expenses of an RTO continue to go up and up. So I think there definitely needs to be an incentive there. Andrew Weisel : Okay, great. Then just one last follow-up question on the renewables. Do you - you talked a bit about the cost savings from coal plant retirements and I know it's early and the cost would be continuously changing hopefully downward. But from what you see today, do you expect this update to the generation stack to lower customer bills in most cases, all else equal and you mentioned something about potential carbon policy, does your analysis assumes some sort of federal clean energy standard and how would it look from an affordability perspective without that? Nick Akins : We've always had the carbon value in our analysis from a resource planning perspective and I think it's $15 a ton is what we've used. In our reports, our Climate Report, we used two cases, a $15 case and a $30 case that was more aggressive and certainly that brought more - that case more renewables in more quickly, but that's not reflected in the plan that we've shown here. So, yes, it's certainly something that we're - we will continue to look at and evaluate with the commission. Julia Sloat : If I could... Nick Akins : Yeah go ahead. Julia Sloat : Just to throw additional finer point on that as well, if carbon pricing is excluded from the equation, the renewable opportunity could get a haircut buy about 2 gigawatts. So it's not that significant, but want to throw that out there. Nick Akins : Yeah, we're looking at this thing as a $15 billion to $20 billion investment opportunity. So, it would be not much of an impact if you took out the carbon pricing, but you can't plan for anything without putting in a carbon pricing these days. Andrew Weisel : Okay, great. And the affordability question, assuming the carbon is in the bulk part of what you're talking... Nick Akins : Yeah, and we've demonstrated that with North Central. I mean, you can put these projects in place and keep in mind, we're thinking about the resiliency and reliability of the grid too. So there's limitations and we have to go through that process, but the ones we have in this plan, we can do and certainly, when you look at the benefits of North Central, for example, it was $3 billion of benefit to the customers and so when you have those kinds of economics in play, if you're able to run your 24/7 generation has more of a reliability and as an insurance policy essentially and layer in as much renewables you can, put in transmission to make sure of the system continues to operate the way it should and then it could be pretty powerful combination to benefit customers in the future. Andrew Weisel : That's great. Thank you very much for the details. Nick Akins : Yeah. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Nick Akins : Good morning, Jeremy. Jeremy Tonet : Good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in here at the end. Just wanted to touch based on Rockport, if I could, in kind of the decision tree that led to this and just wanted to see what other kinds of options you were evaluating, just a bit more color would be helpful there, thanks. Nick Akins : Yeah, so obviously we were looking at future requirements instead of environmental requirements on the units and if we kept them operating longer than 2028, that would be a challenge from an economic perspective. We didn't want to start making those kinds of investments not knowing how long the units would actually be operational, so that was a consideration. The other, as I mentioned, was litigation to clear all that out to make sure we took ownership and we took control. And then, of course the value of the short-term bridge that exists that gives us the flexibility to make decisions with the Indiana Commission to focus on what is the right path for that transition. So it gives us a lot of optionality, a lot of flexibility and the control and by the way, I mean there's two units there. So one we own, one we leased and it just made more sense for us to own both of them and make the decision of the plant as a whole and be able to adjust accordingly. So, it worked out well overall from that perspective and like I say, it gives us a lot of optionality and flexibility and actually at a pretty - at a price that I think it was $115 million. So it's an opportunity for us to really pay for that degree of optionality that has considerable value. Jeremy Tonet : Great, that's helpful. I'll stop there. Thanks. Nick Akins : Yeah, sort of thing. Darcy Reese : This is Darcy. We have time for one more question. Operator : Great, thank you. Our last question comes from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Nick Akins : Michael, you snuck in there. Michael Lapides : I snuck in at the end that better late than never. Thank you for taking my question, team. Hey, Nick, you mentioned Kentucky today, you also outline the renewable growth platform and plan for the regulated businesses. And obviously, lots of renewable companies, pure plays trading at pretty good multiples even after the recent share price weakness, just curious how do you think about the renewable portfolio at the G&M segment and whether that piece of the business is truly core to AEP or whether the real growth is obviously in the regulated subsidiaries and maybe the non-reg contracted renewable business could potentially be a source of funds for the parent to fund regulated growth? Nick Akins : Yeah, so that's been a continual part of our business, just gets allocated capital, the AEP Energy gets allocated capital and he is perfectly willing to throw it back over the fence, because we make evaluations based upon his threshold which is commensurate with the regulated part and also just his business is important because it keeps us in a part of, like for example, we're doing a lot of projects here in Ohio directly with customers and it enables us to with customers and corporations actually and enables us to be in that business, but at the same time, we're able to manage the capital such that you can throw it back over the fence if we see a better opportunity on the regulated side. So we have that working very well where we can make those trade-offs on a continual basis. So yes, it could be a source of capital to do some of these things, and again that lends itself to the portfolio management approach to ensure that we're putting the money in the right place at the right time. So - and like I said, he is doing an incredible job with that and that organization and the fact is they are still doing the renewable part of it, but they're also doing specific relationships with customers with microgrids and those types of applications. So, the value proposition of that business is so important to us seeing the leading edge of what we need to be doing and making cases in our regulated business to ensure that we can continue to grow from those perspectives as well. So, all in all, it's working fine. But, yeah, the answer is yes, we can utilize that as a source. Michael Lapides : Got it. Thank you, Nick. Much appreciate it, guys. Nick Akins : Okay. Darcy Reese : Hey, Tani, I wanted to say thank you for joining us on today's call. As always, the IR team will be available to answer any questions you may have.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session.  As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference to our host, Vice President of Investor Relations, Ms. Darcy Reese. Please go ahead. Darcy Reese : Thank you, Toni. Good morning, everyone. And welcome to the second quarter 2021 earnings call for American Electric Power. We appreciate you taking the time to join us today. Our earnings release, presentation slides and related financial information are available on our website at aep.com. Nick Akins : Okay. Thanks, Darcy. And welcome again everyone to American Electric Power\u2019s second quarter 2021 earnings call. Today we reported a strong second quarter operating earnings of a $1.18 per share versus a $1.08 for the same period of 2020. Our second quarter results reflect significant progress in terms of economic recovery throughout AEP service territory, with a continued focus on OEM as we navigate through what is hopefully an emergence from the COVID-19 pandemic. Gross regional product has already exceeded its pre-pandemic levels and important across AEP service territory is now 2% of its pre-pandemic levels after adding over a 163,000 jobs in the first six months of this year. Increased vaccinations combined with the additional fiscal stimulus from the American Rescue Plan are contributing to the strong demand for goods and services throughout the economy. AEP\u2019s normalized retail sales in the second quarter of 2021 were the highest we have seen since the second quarter of 2018. Clearly, we are pleased with the improvements we have seen thus far and we will continue to monitor the recovery\u2019s progress over the second half of the year.  Accordingly, we are reaffirming our 2021 guidance range of $4.55 per share to $4.75 per share and a 5% to 7% long-term growth rate and would be again disappointed not to be in the upper half of our stated guidance range as we have previously stated. Julie will be discussing these issues in more detail in her report. Rate case activity across our jurisdictions continues to be active and substantial. In Ohio, we are awaiting an order by the commission on the settlement reach involved with the commission earlier this year. As a reminder, the settlement has broad support in the settling parties including the commission staff, the Ohio Consumers Council, industrial companies, commercial companies and other entities like the Ohio Hospital Association. We expect a decision in the third quarter of this year. Public Service Company of Oklahoma filed a rate case at the end of April. PSO is seeking $115.4 million net revenue increase and a 10% ROE. The following transitions North Central costs from the right established in the approval into base rates. Julie Sloat : All right. Thanks, Nick. Thanks, Darcy. It\u2019s good to be with everyone this morning. I am going to walk us through the second quarter and year-to-date financial results, share some thoughts on our service territory load and finish with a review of our credit metrics and liquidity. So let\u2019s go to slide number six which shows the comparison of GAAP to operating earnings for the quarter and year-to-date periods. GAAP earnings for the second quarter were $1.16 per share, compared to $1.05 per share in 2020. GAAP earnings through June were $2.31 per share, compared to $2.05 per share in 2020. There\u2019s a reconciliation of GAAP to operating earnings on pages 14 and 15 of the presentation today. So let\u2019s walk through our quarterly operating earnings performance by segment that\u2019s laid out on slide number seven. Operating earnings for the second quarter totaled $1.18 per share or $590 million, compared to $1.98 per share or $534 million in 2020. Operating earnings for the Vertically Integrated Utilities were $0.45 per share, down $0.10 driven by a year-over-year increase in the O&M due to lower prior year O&M, which included actions we took to adjust to the pandemic. Other pressures included lower wholesale load and higher depreciation and other taxes. These items were partially offset by the impact of rate changes across multiple jurisdictions, higher normalized retail load, transmission revenue and off system sales. The Transmission and Distribution Utilities segment earned $0.31 per share, up $0.02 from last year. Favorable drivers in this segment included higher normalized retail load, transmission revenue and rate changes, partially offsetting these favorable items were higher tax, depreciation and O&M expenses, as well as unfavorable weather and lower AFUDC. The AEP Transmission Holdco segment continued to grow contributing $0.34 per share, an improvement of $0.15, which got a boost because of the unfavorable annual true-up last year consistent with the 2021 earnings guidance assumptions we had provided to you. Our fundamental return on investment growth continued as net plant increased by $1.4 billion or 13% since June of last year. Generation and Marketing produced $0.09 per share, down $0.02 from last year, influenced by the prior year land sales and one-time items relating to an Oklaunion ARO adjustment in the sale of Conesville. We were mostly offset in the generation business by higher energy margins and lower expenses from the retirement of Oklaunion. Finally, Corporate and Other was up $0.05 per share, driven by investment gains, lower tax -- and lower taxes, which was partially offset by higher O&M and net interest expense. So bear with me a moment, I am going to talk a little bit more about that investment gain as we walk through the year-to-date view. So, if you flip to slide eight, we can look at year-to-date results. Operating earnings through June totaled $2.33 per share or $1.2 billion, compared to $2.10 per share or $1 billion in 2020. Looking at the drivers by segment, operating earnings for Vertically Integrated Utilities were $1 per share, down $0.05 due to higher O&M and depreciation expenses. Other smaller increases included lower normalized retail and wholesale load, other -- higher other taxes and a prior period fuel adjustment. The impact of weather was favorable due to the warmer than normal temps in the winter of 2020. Other favorable items in this segment included the impact of rate changes across multiple jurisdictions, higher off-system sales and transmission revenue. The Transmission and Distribution Utilities segment earned $0.54 per share, up $0.01 from last year. Earnings in this segment were up due to higher transmission revenue, rate changes, weather and normalized retail load, partially offsetting these favorable items were higher tax, depreciation, O&M and interest expenses, as well as lower AFUDC. The AEP Transmission Holdco segment contributed $0.68 per share, up $0.21 from last year, for the same reasons identified in the quarterly comparison. Generation and Marketing produced $0.16 per share, down $0.02 from last year, due to favorable one-time items in the prior year relating to an Oklaunion ARO adjustment in the sale of Conesville, higher energy margins and lower expenses in the generation business offset the unfavorable ERCOT market prices on the wholesale business during Storm Uri in February. The decrease in renewables business was driven by lower energy margins and higher expenses. Finally, Corporate and Other was up $0.08 per share, driven by investment gains and lower taxes and partially offset by higher O&M. So, let me take a quick moment to comment about the investment gain which is predominantly a function of our direct and indirect investment in charge point. As you will see on the waterfall, this produced a $0.09 benefit year-to-date in 2021 as compared to the corresponding 2020 period. You may recall that in the fourth quarter and full year 2020, this investment produced a $0.05 contribution and we would expect the year-over-year variance to be more pronounced at this point in 2021 as we had no benefit during the same period in 2020. So, turning to page nine, I will update you on our normalized load performance for the quarter. Before I talk about class level trends, I\u2019d like to start with a couple of observations at a macro level. So, first of all, since all of these charts are showing a year-over-year growth, it is important to recall that the second quarter of 2020 was at the trough of the recession when restrictions on businesses to manage the public health crisis were at their greatest. So the magnitude of growth percentages is being influenced by the comparison basis. And the second observation is that there has been a steady path to recovery since bottoming out in the second quarter of last year. The momentum we are seeing is a positive sign for the economic recovery throughout the serviced territory. So, if you start in the upper left corner, you will see that normalized residential sales were down 3.1% compared to last year bringing year-to-date decline down to 0.5%. As mentioned earlier, the comparison basis is the key here. You will notice that residential sales were up 6.2% when the COVID restrictions were at their greatest. In fact, one year later, they are only down 3.1% which suggests some of the increase in residential is having some staying power as more businesses have embraced a remote workforce for jobs that can be easily performed at home. In fact, the second quarter normalized sales in 2021 were the second highest second quarter on record exceeding every second quarter before the pandemic began. So moving to the right, weather normalized commercial sales increased by 10% bringing the year-to-date growth up to 3.9%. If you compare this with the residential class, you will notice the commercial sales growth in the second quarter is more symmetrical with last year when sales were down just over 10%. The growth in commercial sales for the quarter is spread across all operating companies and most sectors. The only sector that was down slightly compared to last year was grocery stores, which were very busy at the onset of the pandemic trying to keep shelves stocked when panic purchasing was at its highest. So moving to the lower left corner, you will see that the industrial sales also bounced back in the second quarter. Industrial sales for the quarter increased by 12.8% bringing the year-to-date growth up to 2 -- up 2.8%. Similar to commercial class -- the commercial class, you will see a symmetrical recovery compared to the second quarter of 2020 when sales were down 12.4%. Also industrial sales were up at every operating company and nearly every sector. The only industrial sector in our top 10 that reported less sales this year compared to the second quarter of 2020 is a paper manufacturing sector, which ironically was also higher last year, partially due to panic purchasing of toilet paper. This is a phenomenon that none of us is likely to forget especially if you were one of the folks who didn\u2019t get a jump on it. Finally, in the lower right corner, you can see that in total normalized retail sales increased by 6.3% for the quarter and were up 1.9% through the first half of the year. By all indications, recovery from the pandemic and recession are on a firm footing. So, let\u2019s go to slide 10. There are two more charts here that help put the second quarter normalized sales performance into perspective. The bar chart shows the last five years of weather normalized retail sales in the second quarters for the AEP System. Retail load performance in the second quarter of 2021 has not only recovered from the recession, but this is also the highest second quarter since 2018. The line chart on the bottom of this page shows the seasonally adjusted retail sales by quarter which provides an illustration of the trend of the recovery, and again, confirms that our current level of sales is the highest since the second quarter of 2018. So, before we leave the load story, let me remind you of an important factor to consider when evaluating the impact of load growth. The mix matters. So, while we are seeing strong growth now in commercial and industrial sales, those are priced at much lower realizations than the decline we are seeing in residential sales. To further illustrate this point, the impact of the pandemic was most pronounced in our biggest metropolitan area, that\u2019s Columbus Ohio. Since Columbus -- since AEP Ohio is in the T&D Utility segment where we only collect an unbundled rate, the strong recovery that we are seeing this year is coming in at much lower realizations in the system average. Finally, let me remind you that there are rate design mechanisms in place to limit the exposure when entering a downturn that can also limit the impact when you are coming out of recession. So while the industrial sales are up significantly this year versus last year, it does not mean that revenues will increase by the same percentage. So what does all this mean when we think about the remainder of 2020? Well, it means that our confidence in our earnings guidance range is fortified by what we are seeing. It suggests that the low trends we anticipated are coming to fruition as the chart on page nine illustrates. Our continued investment at Transco is fueling strong performance in this segment beyond the favorable true-up impact that we had anticipated. And while O&M is up, it\u2019s enabling us to take care of our business and customer needs given the low growth we are seeing. Obviously, we have the second half of the year to navigate, but we are pleased with the direction and are keeping a watchful eye on economic activity in our service territory, while scanning for any impact associated with rise in COVID variant. So, let\u2019s check in on the company\u2019s capitalization and liquidity position on page 11. On a GAAP basis, our debt to capital ratio increase 0.1% from the prior year quarter to 62.6% when adjusted for the Storm Uri event, the ratio remains consistent with year-end 2020 at 61.8%. Let\u2019s talk about our FFO to debt metric. As it did in the first quarter the effect of Storm Uri continues to have a temporary and noticeable impact in 2021 on this metric. Taking a look at the upper right quadrant on this page, you will see that our FFO to debt metric based on the traditional Moody\u2019s and GAAP calculated basis, as well as on an adjusted Moody\u2019s and GAAP calculated basis. On a traditional unadjusted basis, our FFO to debt ratio increased by 0.2% during the quarter to 9.3% on a Moody\u2019s basis. On an adjusted basis, the Moody\u2019s FFO to debt metric is 12.8%. To be very clear, this 12.8% figure removes or adjusts the calculation to eliminate the impact of approximately $1.2 billion of cash outflows associated with covering the unplanned Uri driven fuel and purchase power costs in the SPP region directly impacting PSO and SWEPCO in particular. This metric is also adjusted to remove the effect of the associated debt we used to fund the unplanned payments. It should give you a sense of where we would be from a business as usual perspective. As you know, we are in frequent contact with the rating agencies to keep them apprised of all aspects of our business. The rating agencies continue to take the anticipated regulatory recovery into consideration as it relates to our credit rating. And importantly, there continues to be no change in our equity financing plan and our multiyear cash flow forecast is laid out on page 39 does not assume any asset rotation proceeds. Given the regulatory recovery activity that currently in flight, we do expect our FFO to debt cash flow metric to return to the low to mid-teens target range next year. So here\u2019s a quick refresh on where all this regulatory activity stands today for PSO and SWEPCO. In Oklahoma, we are working through the regulatory process and anticipate issuing securitization bonds in the first half of 2022. In both Arkansas and Louisiana, recovery is underway, while final details get worked out in the regulatory process and we will be filing for recovery in Texas in the third quarter of 2021. So let\u2019s take a quick moment to visit our liquidity summary on slide 11. You will see here that our liquidity position remains strong at $3.3 billion, supported by our five-year $4 billion bank revolver and two-year $1 billion revolving credit facility that we entered into on March 31st of this year. If you look at the lower left side of the page, you will see there are qualified pension continues to be well funded and our OpEd is funded at 174.2%. So let\u2019s go to slide 12, we will do a quick wrap up and we can get your questions. Our performance in the first half of the year gives us confidence to reaffirm our operating earnings guidance range of $4.55 per share to $4.75 per share. Because of our ability to continue to invest in our own system organically including both our energy delivery system and the transformation of our generation fleet, we are confident in our ability to grow the company at our stated long-term growth rate of 5% to 7%. So we surely do appreciate your time and attention today. So, with that, I am going to turn the call over to the Operator for your questions. Operator : Thank you.  And that will come from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey. Good\u2026 Nick Akins : Hi, Julien. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Thank you for all the remarks. I\u2019d say at the pace that you guys were just talking I would have mistaken you guys sitting in New York or something like this? Nick Akins : Yeah. No. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: So, I am going to try to catch up on everything that was just said. But maybe in summary on the logos, I hear you. I think the critical comment you made was mixed. Where are you trending against your guidance range here as you think, but obviously third quarter matters critically, obviously kept intact the total load growth here? Any comments to just resolve that against the full year numbers, I mean, I know we are still early-ish in the year? Nick Akins : Yeah. I think, well, you just sort of answered the question. We are still early in the year because the third quarter is particularly meaningful and we typically look after third quarter to see where we actually stand. But again, as Julie mentioned, OEM goes up commensurate with all the customer expansion as well and we have pretty sizable customer expansion. Look at the industrial and commercial numbers. They are up considerably. So and I think obviously without outstripping our estimate going into the year of what overall load growth would be. But it remains to be seen. Because I think we are sort of in a very cyclical period of trying to figure out what the future holds in terms of whether this other variant of COVID is going to have an impact or what happens actually is there are just pent-up frustration then it starts to moderate. What\u2019s promising is though that we are seeing -- we are still seeing residential load, although it\u2019s negative to 2020, it\u2019s still a positive overall. So our original thesis of more residential load going forward. And if we can tie that together with improved industrial and commercial load as well, it could be very positive. But we certainly have to feel our way through that and really understand that. So we pass the third quarter before we really have a good feeling of that. Julie? Julie Sloat : Yeah. Just maybe add a little finer point too. If you are thinking sequentially for the remainder of the year, our load growth rates are expected to moderate in the second half of the year based on prior year comps. So when you think about it, restrictions were most severe in the second quarter and by the third quarter of last year, so by the third quarter of last year, the service territory had begun essentially a phased reopening. And so as a result, the 6.3% growth for the second quarter, probably not only the highest growth in the quarter. And actually it is the highest growth in AEP\u2019s history. But it will also be the highest load growth stat during the recovery. So if you think about the second half of the year, I would expect it year-over-year to moderate a little bit and so we are just keeping a watchful eye on how the trend continues to click along. I know I saw in The Wall Street Journal this morning CFOs commenting on where they think the economy is going to go, doesn\u2019t look like anybody is changing their estimates based on COVID trends. But we are keeping an eye on that. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. Excellent. Thank you. And then, if I can pivot the text, obviously, you all have a pretty meaningful footprint there. We have seen various legislative efforts underway. I am curious, as best you can tell thus far, I know it\u2019s early. Any kind of context you can put especially on the transmission side, the potential project here? We are hearing from some of your peers about potentially meaningful shifts? Nick Akins : Well, certainly, obviously, it remains to be seen as far as transmission investment and really we think of T&D and what part of the business is associated with T&D. We have made some inroads in terms of in terms of backup generation, those kinds of things in terms of transmission. I really think there\u2019s probably continued opportunity for development of storage capability, of other transmission related investments on the grid to ensure that we are able to adjust that. For us, we are doing a lot in terms of line of sight into the transmission grid itself. We are continuing to expand our scale abilities, continuing to focus on our ability to have even more transmission in place, because if you are looking for additional generation to be placed in various areas, well, transmission is a big part of that solution as well. So is that, I think, Texas is sort of a microcosm of the country when you start reevaluating the system based upon the needs from not only a natural gas perspective, but also from a renewable perspective, that brings in the whole planning effort and communication in real time associated with the operations of the transmission and it -- for that matter the distribution system as well. So I think they are making the right steps and I think there\u2019s more steps to be made so and it\u2019s going to be a sort of a multiyear top of effort, and of course, we are a big part of the transmission in Texas. So we will be certainly very focused on how the T&D business can be expanded to improve the resiliency of the T&D efforts. But that means Texas is really going to have to start thinking about resources and a broader view of resources like we are having to do for the rest of the system and transmission technologies, and for that matter, distribution technologies are going to have to be recognized in its ability to provide a more resilient grid. You can\u2019t have these strict lines drawn between generation and transmission and distribution because that\u2019s not the world we are in anymore. So, we will continue that focus. Every legislative session, every regulatory session will be centered on that effort. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent. Just last, Kentucky, I know you can\u2019t say much, but what\u2019s the level of interest if you can give any kind of parameters? Nick Akins : Yeah. So, yeah, obviously, I don\u2019t want to get into too much detail there. I think, again, you answered it sort of right at the beginning. It is a confidential process. But I can say that we do have a credible interest and it is a competitive process. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent. Thank you all. Take care. Nick Akins : Okay. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Nick Akins : Good morning, Steve. Steve Fleishman : Hey. Good morning. Can you hear me, Nick? Nick Akins : Good morning. Oh! Yeah. I can hear you fine. Steve Fleishman : Okay. Great. Thanks. I might have missed this, but just where are you on this $600 million of equity plan for this year? How much have you issued so far? Julie Sloat : Yeah. Thanks for the question, Steve. We have actually used the ATM to issue just under $200 million. I think there\u2019s around $195 million that was associated with the financing of the Sundance North Central wind facility and we will be continuing on with the rest of that program. As you know, about $100 million of that $600 million is also associated with the drip. So that continues to play in the background. Does that help? Steve Fleishman : Okay. Julie Sloat : Yeah. Steve Fleishman : And then just -- this might be a little bit hard to answer, but just in terms of thinking about the $1.4 billion for next year that\u2019s in the plan. Obviously, if you were to sell Kentucky, some of that could maybe offset some of that. So just -- could you just give us latest thoughts on how to think about the Kentucky outcome relative to that $1.4 billion for next year? Julie Sloat : Yeah. And then, I will -- Nick can add a finer point from a strategic perspective. But purely from a financing perspective, you are right on the money, Steve. So we got $1.4 billion embedded in our plan. And for those of you who following along at home, we are on page 39 of the cash flow if you want to take a look at 2022. About $100 million of that again is associated with the drip, about $800 million is associated with north central wind financing and then we have another $500 million just associated with general funding of growth CapEx. And so to your point, Steve, to the extent that we would find ourselves in a situation where we were able to transact and bring dollars in the door, we would absolutely be able to work off some of that, otherwise equity issuance and sidestep that. So I don\u2019t -- I can\u2019t give you a number. We don\u2019t have a transaction. But that is absolutely the thinking and how we are modeling different scenarios inside the house. And I don\u2019t know, Nick, if you have any comment, it would be great. Nick Akins : Well, I think, you covered it well. As far as -- it\u2019s great to have a financing plan assuming Kentucky a sale at Kentucky doesn\u2019t happen. But also it\u2019s great to have options available to further optimize what that financing plan looks like. So and it is -- and I will say again, the timing particularly with Traverse being the last one, it\u2019s the largest one in first quarter 2022, that sums up pretty well with this process. So we will get this resolved and there will be finance one way or another, but at the end of the day, the timing of it and the process is continuing on plan. Julie Sloat : And just if I could\u2026 Steve Fleishman : Okay. Julie Sloat : \u2026to follow up\u2026 Steve Fleishman : Yeah. Julie Sloat : \u2026Steve. Again just to reiterate. The plan as it stands today, as you know, assumes no asset rotation. And again, I want to reinforce that, the 5% to 7% is well intact even if we don\u2019t have a transaction. Steve Fleishman : Okay. And are you -- do you have a bias within that range at all or just the kind of that\u2019s the range? Nick Akins : That\u2019s -- probably we can\u2019t answer at this point, Steve. Steve Fleishman : Okay. So you are being very unbiased? Nick Akins : We are. Steve Fleishman : Smart move. Okay. Thanks so much. Nick Akins : Yeah. Sure. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead. Nick Akins : Good morning, Shahriar. Shahriar Pourreza : Hey. Good morning, guys. I wanted to start with a recent event and get your sense on the Mitchell order and Kentucky, sort of rejecting the rate increase you saw, and obviously, it\u2019s not a surprise well on AG strong comments prior to the decision. Nick is this sort of a signal that the state and the PSC in general they are starting to commit to maybe a little bit more of a rational thinking around an economic approach to coal like the least cost approach is just starting to bend further towards renewable. So how do we think about the viability of the plant in the state and could we see some acceleration of that 1.4-gig of solar and when you bought into plan for the state on a prior call as a direct grid? And then, how do we sort of think about West Virginia\u2019s rate request coming off the Kentucky order? Nick Akins : Yeah. That\u2019s right. It\u2019s sort of interesting. I mean, it\u2019s multi-jurisdictional, as you know, and Mitchell is wheeling in Kentucky Power. And I think we have to get resolved Kentucky, Virginia and West Virginia. West Virginia has yet to speak on this issue, but -- and it\u2019s only the ALJ in Virginia. So we will hear more on from Virginia on that. But I think it\u2019s really important for us to really hold on our cards for now, because we got to get through a state process. It\u2019s good to have clarity. And I think Kentucky, obviously, is the first shoe to drop in this regard. But we have also made it clear that these are multi-jurisdiction unit. So we have to make sure that there\u2019s some compatibility of the jurisdictions that are involved. We will go through the process. We will get the initial views of the commissions and then if they are on different tracks, we will have to further analyze and resolve that with the commissions and there\u2019s a lot of resolutions that could occur. Some are shorter, some are longer. But we have to understand where all three commissions are before really doing anything. I think it\u2019s good to get clarity though and I think it\u2019s pretty important that whether it\u2019s the ELG or the CCR, if they approve CCR investments, but don\u2019t improve -- approve ELG investments, then that effectively brings the generation retirement dates back from 2014 to 2028. So that\u2019s something we have to consider along with those commissions. But we will know more about this in the August time frame. But I\u2019d be hesitant to say what Kentucky, it\u2019s pretty interesting that they would be looking at the ELG part of it. And I think there is becoming more of an awareness of -- that there has to be a plan. Now what that plan is, we have got a fully resolved with all those commissions. So, more to come on that. Shahriar Pourreza : Got it. And thanks for the visibility around sort of the Kentucky process. I know, Nick, you obviously mentioned that further optimization is always a possibility. Remind us just like that sugar point is the shaping of that for instance that 16.6 gigawatts of renewables you discussed in the prior call. Obviously, Kentucky will more than likely backfill some of your North Central equity needs. So as you are thinking about further optimization, should we be watching the outcomes at the IRPs, the PSC approval, how much you plan to own versus PPA, which I guess would stipulate your incremental equity needs and the resulting size of potentially further optimization measures? Nick Akins : Yeah. Yeah. So -- and just like, we have gone through probably a couple of years now of discussions about how North Central is going to get financed and we are finally getting to a point where ultimately we will know how it\u2019s being financed. The 16.6 gigawatts and -- is, certainly, we made a pretty credible case that we ought to own a significant part of that. I\u2019d like to own all of it. But certainly, if -- but operationally, and from a contracting standpoint, and certainly, the ability for us to respond to a system related activities, it\u2019s important for us to own and control those assets. And I think that, as we go forward, you are right, it will be the integrated resource planning filings that were made, there will start that dialogue, now we are in the process of doing RFPs to get more information obviously from the -- for the market in terms of what\u2019s out there from a developmental perspective and that process is ongoing. So, that will certainly fortify any CCN filings we have to make or anything like that after the resource planning filings. But the resource planning filings will be your first real dialogue around how quickly this transformation will occur and in each one of the jurisdictions. And so, we are feeling pretty good about it, because it\u2019s getting to a point where we have to decide from a capacity standpoint, how we support these utilities and it\u2019s pretty clear to me that the movement is to that clean energy economy to move it is to toward as long as you have some element of baseload 24x7 capacity, that renewables will be the big part of that. So, a lot of that\u2019s just becoming, I think, it\u2019s becoming much more transparent and our jurisdictions, I think, their conditions both federally and from a state perspective, they are just a better realization of what the options are and the timing of those options. And that\u2019s what will drive of course to that resource planning process. Shahriar Pourreza : Got it. And lastly for me and I apologize if I am putting you on the spot, Nick. The news just broke out this morning. But is there any kind of refer to the First Energy deferred prosecution agreement that was announced this morning to the SEC investigation at AEP? Nick Akins : No. Like I said before, we are on the outside looking in. We have no knowledge of any of that activity. And so if the report is true, I am glad to see that there is some element of putting all these in a rearview mirror, because naturally, and I said before, AEP has been hung up in the wake of that. And I am certainly hopeful that there\u2019s some closure brought about from that. So, but, yeah, I have -- it was a surprise to me and we knew nothing about it, and certainly, there\u2019s really nothing else that we have -- that AEP can say other than what we have put on our website and naturally there\u2019s just nothing to report from our perspective. Shahriar Pourreza : Terrific. Thank you, Nick and Julie. Congrats on today\u2019s results. Nick Akins : Yeah. Okay. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Nick Akins : Good morning, Stephen. Stephen Byrd : Hey. Good morning. Nick Akins : How are you? Stephen Byrd : Congrats on a constructive update and on weeping in, you mentioned of both, Carly Simon and a  maybe a first. Nick Akins : Yeah. Right. Stephen Byrd : Okay. So a lot has been covered . Just wanted to discuss on Kentucky, if there are approaches that can help minimize tax leakage, how are you all thinking about sort of ability to bring proceeds back and sort of the impact of taxes? Julie Sloat : Yeah. Thanks for the question, Stephen. As you know, we are a little tax efficient right now. So, given the tax basis in Kentucky and the different hurdles that we are considering, I wouldn\u2019t see that one being a show stopper. And quite frankly, that might give us an opportunity to enhance or improve our tax efficiency without getting into a bunch of numbers. I wouldn\u2019t let that trip you up in terms of what things could stop us moving forward. Stephen Byrd : Yeah. That\u2019s helpful. And then maybe just thinking through the upcoming RFPs, you mentioned the APCo and SWEPCO RFPs, could you just talk a little more detail in terms of color around the timetable there? And I am sorry if I missed that if you all did go through it. I don\u2019t -- didn\u2019t quite follow there, I am just thinking about sort of what that might mean for timing of incremental spending and sort of how we should think about those processes? Nick Akins : Yeah. So, we have certainly gone through the basic requirements for the RFPs for all of these areas. But as we go through that process, there is -- at APCo, we issued an RFP there for 300 megawatts of solar and wind resources really for a completion date of 2023 or 2024. And then in May of 2021, APCo issued an RFP to obtain, I guess, it was 100 megawatts of solar and wind energy via PPA and RFP for the renewable energy certificates only, which is consistent with the Virginia and what their requirements are. And then, SWEPCO issued an RFP for own resources up to 3,000 megawatts of wind and up to 300 megawatts of solar resources with optional battery storage by the way that can achieve a completion by 2024 to 2025. And they are also seeking 200 megawatts of capacity into 2023 to 2024 range and another 250 into 2025 to 2027 range, so those bids are due in mid-August. And then at PSO, we -- in June, we notified the regulators that it intends -- we intend to issue an RFP seeking up to 2,600 megawatts of wind and up to 1,350 megawatts of solar, again with options for battery storage consideration and that\u2019s meeting capacity needs by 2025. So and then PSO plans to issue the RFP in October of this year. So those are the ones that are on the Board right now, and have really some near-term related requirements and most are capacity related requirements. So, and again, they are being done pretty much the same way as the others with North Central that we will certainly do more of it of a turnkey type of thing where we take ownership at the time it is approved in rate. So, and then, of course, we will go through the process of approvals by the various commissions along the way. So, but that\u2019s the plan right now. And then, we will continue to -- as a matter of fact, we are spending a lot of time with our Board focused on the strategies related to these types of filings and the plan long-term and it\u2019s important for everyone to understand this is going to be a continual process. And you are just seeing the first part of these really driven by capacity requirements and not just sort of an energy convenience. So, I think, they are really good to go out with right now and that\u2019s what we have at this point. Stephen Byrd : That\u2019s really helpful. That\u2019s all I had. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Jeremy Tonet : Hi. Good morning. Nick Akins : Good morning. How are you doing? Jeremy Tonet : Good. Good. Nick Akins : Okay. Jeremy Tonet : Just wanted to pick up on Kentucky a little bit more, if that\u2019s possible and I just want to know if you might be able to comment in any degree to whether the strategic review process has received more interest from strategic or financial players? And then as well, kind of given strong prices achieved in recent industry transactions and the strong interest here in Kentucky, has this process made you thought about more asset rotation beyond Kentucky to increase balance sheet headroom overall? Nick Akins : Yeah. So, for the first question, we started out this process saying that that we expected to get strategics and financials, and we have strategics and financials, so both are involved. And then as far as your second question is concerned, as I said earlier with the Foo Fighters dialogue, this is going to be a continual process for us. And if we are practically fully regulated so we have the opportunities to look at if we are building 16.6 gigawatts of renewables resources during the transition, then we got to think -- we have to have everything on the table in terms of sources and uses. So we are going to go through that process, and of course, Kentucky is sort of a first stop, but we will continue to evaluate our assets as sources. And if it makes sense, based upon what the other opportunities are, then that\u2019s the kind of framework that we want to move this company toward. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks for that. And then there\u2019s news coming out of FERC with regards to kind of the transmission planning process. I am just wondering if you might be able to provide some thoughts on -- your thoughts on what\u2019s been said recently and what you see is kind of best practices here? Nick Akins : Yeah. So, obviously, we would like to see a much better transmission related planning across regions and AEP does a pretty good job itself in terms of transmission planning, because we do have a large system to consider. But at the same, RTO to RTO type planning process to try to make them more consistent so you can have this large transmission being built across regions and across states. If you are going to get that going, particularly as you are trying to get renewable resources to load centers, we are going to have to resolve these issues around multi-jurisdictional, multi-RTO type of analyses and making sure that we are consistent. The other part too is we have got to have consistency in terms of rate making and this notion of reevaluating incentives, structures and those types of things is not good for making decisions relative to transmission or -- and this is not good relative to the RTO model itself. So, I think, FERC really needs to sort of step back and take a look at it. And I think it\u2019s a real positive approach to be focusing on the planning aspects and addressing RTO to RTO boundaries, addressing areas where, what\u2019s competitive, what\u2019s not competitive, all those types of things, that\u2019s fine. But we have to have a clear planning process. And first of all, you can\u2019t have coming back later after a project, multi-millions have been spent on a project to, say, we are going to stop the project. That has to change. And the other part of it is, we have got to be able to make these investments with some sense of certainty and be able to move quickly to make that happen. So, I just -- I think, there\u2019s only so much value -- there\u2019s a lot of value of being in an RTO for customers. But there also has to be value for the companies involved from -- to make the investments that benefit customers in orders of magnitude greater than what the costs are related to, any incentives related to transmission. And if you want to send a bad message for anybody to join an RTO or anybody to stay in an RTO, it\u2019s just not good to start messing around with what the assumptions are relative to the future recovery of transmission investment. And now, when you start questioning incentives, you are really questioning anybody that\u2019s trying to put a multiyear model together to show the benefits of transmission has to take that into account that something may change. So, like trying to make an investment in a coal unit, with clean energy activities going on in Washington. So you really do have to really think this process through and think about what you are trying to achieve. Sorry, I went on that one though. Jeremy Tonet : No. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you for that. I will stop there. Thank you. Nick Akins : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Nick Akins : Hey, Durgesh. How are you? Durgesh Chopra : Hey. Good morning, Nick. Thanks for taking my question. Nick Akins : Good morning. Durgesh Chopra : Hey. You addressed sort of a lot of transmission questions in the Q&A. Maybe just like the MISO transmission opportunity that the MISO has flagged perhaps just sort of unveiled towards the end of the year. I know a small sort of a set of assets for you in that location. But could you compete for some of those projects? Could that be an upside for you there? Nick Akins : Oh! Yeah. We could. We could compete with our Transource entity, which we have been. But, yeah, we could. And actually a small impact for us as it stands. But certainly, we could certainly participate in any of that, yeah. Durgesh Chopra : Understood. And then just anything you are hearing at your level and your peers and through the sort of the EI organization. I mean the infrastructure bill has a pretty sizable CapEx on the transmission side or investment on the transmission side. Just anything you are hearing from that on the federal front? Nick Akins : Yeah. So, obviously, we have the, I guess, that\u2019s $1.2 trillion, the infrastructure bill that -- it\u2019s interesting we are talking in trillions as opposed to billions now. But in terms of the hard infrastructure side of things, yeah, it appears there\u2019s some kind of convergence in Washington on that particular issue, although, more has to be done on the actual language and things like that. But as far as pursuing the advancement of, and certainly, transmission investment, but direct pay and those kinds of issues are clearly important along the way. We also have to, as far as, renewables and clean energy, PTCs, ITCs extensions of those, I think that makes sense, particularly RSI  did the delays because of COVID and that kind of thing. So I think there\u2019s opportunities for that and then as far as electric vehicles, certainly we would like to see electric vehicle infrastructure continue to be developed. So, I think all of those areas are positive. The issue is how you leverage into the private. The private companies like ours or that instead of the government funding and for transmission, for example, we think that mechanisms already exist for the development of transmission as long as you can keep all the incentives and all that kind of stuff. But -- so the federal and -- federal government funding of that now is, I think, you have to sort of think about what level of encouragement and what area. So, if they can make siding much better, if they can make, certainly, the focus on planning. Those issues enable transmission to get investments. We have no problem financing transmission investments. So I think the government probably ought to pick and choose between what they truly want to focus on that not already leveraged into the utilities, for example. They can certainly encourage development of electric vehicles with the focus on charging station infrastructure and those types of things that would be a benefit. And then, as far as the renewables transformation or the clean energy transformation, any kind of hard infrastructure around being able to move more quickly from a renewable standpoint, whether tax incentives and also uh other technologies like storage. And then also, we would like to see benefits related to either tax incentives for coal-fired generation to reduce the underappreciated plant balances, for example. If you want to have a national plan around moving to a clean energy economy, then the more quickly we can reduce underappreciated plant balances, the better we are able to make decisions and conditions, and states can make decisions about what future resource replacements would be. So I think there\u2019s several ways to really focus on this. But we are all moving toward a clean energy economy. We just need to make sure that the government doesn\u2019t try to do too much across the Board as opposed to very selected areas that enable investment to continue in the private sector. That would be my view. Durgesh Chopra : Appreciate that color, Nick. Really quick just -- good to see First Energy with all the DOJ investigation or at least have an agreement this morning they highlighted. Just any update on the SEC subpoena you got? Any more color that you can share with us? Nick Akins : No. Nothing new there. We are -- we have been communicating with the SEC and we are responsive to any requests they have from a documentation standpoint. And we are going to continue to work with them and be supportive and constructive in the process and but nothing new to report there. Durgesh Chopra : Understood. Thank you for taking my questions. Nick Akins : Yeah. Operator : Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Michael Lapides : Nice try on that one. Nick Akins : Michael who? Michael Lapides : Yeah. Hey. Actually, Michael, the guy who\u2019s excited about the changes in the Southeastern Conference they had. Hey, guys, real quick question or two. First of all, one on O&M this year, obviously, O&M at the VIU segment is up a lot. How do you think about what the second half of the year O&M trajectory looks like versus the first half? And how should we think about both for VIU and T&D kind of segments, the long-term kind of the 2022 and beyond trajectory for O&M? Nick Akins : Yeah. I will just generally say, and Julie can certainly follow up on this, but as you have expansions in customer load, you are going to have higher O&M associated with that, but that\u2019s a good expansion. The issue for us is, what we typically do is, we are evaluating the true impacts of our Achieving Excellence Program against what our forecast needs to be in terms of bending the O&M curve. So we continue to take account of the good O&M that supports the expansion from a customer load perspective, but also continue to not only optimize that, but also continue the overall optimization of the O&M budget itself. So, yeah, you may see it, and that\u2019s why, obviously, we are watching what third quarter looks like and fourth quarter with the low it does. But we want to make absolutely sure that we are continuing to make progress consistent with that plan of consistent earnings and dividend improvements in that 5% to 7% growth trajectory. So that\u2019s what we are doing. We are not just saying, oh, yeah, load\u2019s going up, let\u2019s spend more O&M. It really is a measured approach from our perspective. Julie? Julie Sloat : Yeah. No. That\u2019s spot on, Nick. And thanks for the question, Michael. As I am sitting here thinking about this and as we were preparing for the earnings call, one of the things I am looking at is the mix point. You look at where load is coming in. And as mentioned in a previous answer to a question, we do expect that load on a relative basis. When you compare it to last year, for the second half, it would not be as pronounced, although we do expect it to continue to improve. So that\u2019s a good thing. And that allows us to be a little more comfortable with O&M costs where they are, because that does help the customer in the long run. So we keep that top of mind and continue to be very diligent about managing costs. But if you are trying to model for the rest of the year, let me start by saying this, we are not changing our guidance. But as you know, once we start the year and we give you that plan, so you see that waterfall that we give to you, how we get to the end of the year, obviously changes, right, because it\u2019s a dynamic business. So I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if relative to that plan, if you saw our O&M be running a little richer. But I would hope that load would be hanging in there too. And then, as you know, we are doing well on the Transmission Holdco segment already kind of clipping along where we thought we would be for the full year. So there may be some benefit there too. So do keep that in mind when you go back and compare and contrast to that guidance walk that we gave to you. I think it was on February 25th during our earnings call and then we are happy to help you with any modeling that you have offline. Michael Lapides : No. That sounds great. Thanks, guys. Much appreciated. Nick Akins : Sure. Thanks. Darcy Reese : Thank you for joining us on today\u2019s call. As always, the IR team will be available to answer any additional questions you may have. Toni, would you please give the replay information. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this conference will be available for a replay after 11 :30 a.m. Eastern today through July 29, 2021.

At this time, your telephone lines are in a listen-only mode. Later there will be an opportunity for questions and answers. If you would like to ask a question during the call,  You have an indication you've been placed into queue, and you will move yourself from the queue by repeating the one as we command. Now as a reminder, your conference call today is being recorded. I will now turn the conference call over to your host, Vice President of Investor Relations, Darcy Reese. Go ahead please. Darcy Reese : Thank you, Allen. Good morning, everyone and welcome to the Third Quarter 2021 earnings call for American Electric Power. We appreciate you taking the time to join us today. Our earnings release, presentation slides and related financial information are available on our website at www. aep.com. Today we will be making Forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors. Joining me this morning for opening remarks are Nick Akins, our Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer and Julie Sloat our Chief Financial Officer. We will take your questions following their remarks. I will now turn the call over to Nick. Nick Akins : Okay. Thanks, Darcy. Welcome again, everyone to American Electric Power's third quarter 2021 earnings call. Today we're pleased to report a strong third quarter operating earnings of a $1.43 per share for the third quarter, this brings our year-to-date operating earnings to 376 per share versus 356 per share last year, which gives us confidence in raising the midpoint of our guidance range for 2021.  AEP service territory continues to prove us with resiliency and stability with continued economic recovery experienced in the third quarter. In fact, AEP posted the strongest sales quarter in over a decade, and the gross regional product for the AEP footprint of third quarter was the highest on record, as well as job growth being the strongest since 1984. The strength and diversity of our portfolio, the robustness of our organic growth opportunities, and our consistent ability to execute against our plan places AEP among what we believe should be one of the country's premium regulated utilities.  Our strength -- our strong performance this quarter, coupled with the level of economic recovery experienced within our footprint, provides us, once again, the confidence needed to raise our midpoint to 470 per share and nearer, the 2021 guidance range to 465 to 475 while reaffirming our 5% to 7% long-term earnings growth rate. And as I've stated previously, I would still be disappointed if we were not in that upper half of our long-term growth rate. The driver of our strong performance is the talent and commitment of our employees.  Our front line of central service work teams has continued to adapt to ensure the needs of our customers and communities are met day in day -- day in and day out throughout the pandemic. Like many industries, the face of work for AEP will never be the same. As employees return to the office, we have taken actions to ensure the safe return to the workplace environment. I remain appreciative of the dedication of our employees and have the utmost confidence in their continuing ability to successfully check and adjust as we adapt to the future.  We believe that this new work environment will continue to enable more efficiency, flexibility, and creativity, that will contribute to the culture to excel in meeting our strategic objectives. This new future of work along with digitization and automation will continue to provide benefits for our Achieving Excellence program. Our growth opportunities over the next decade are significant driven by our future forward renewables plan, that over 16 gigawatts of new renewables resources by 2030, and the transmission distribution investments needed to support the needs of a clean energy economy for our customers and communities.  Additionally, the completion of a strategic review of our Kentucky Companies and our decision to move forward with the sale delivered utilities enables us to focus our attention on executing that transaction and delivering on our gross strategy. So, let's cover the announced sale of Kentucky Power. Earlier this week, on Tuesday at market close, we announced the sale of Kentucky Power and Kentucky Transco to Liberty Utilities, the regulated utility operation of Algonquin Power.  The sale was a result of the strategic review that we launched back in April. The sale was subject to regulatory approvals, including approvals from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission which is within a 180 days, and the Kentucky Public Service Commission, within a 120 days. The transaction was also subject to federal clearance pursuant to Hart-Scott-Rodino, which typically is within 30 to 60 days, and the clearance from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., within 90 and a 120 days for that approval.  We anticipate making these regulatory filings in late November and early December. Separately, we will file -- with both the Kentucky, West Virginia and full commissions with necessary changes to the metro plant operating agreement to accommodate the ELG investments recently approved by the West Virginia Commission. The following will include a plan to resolve the question of Mitchell ownership post 2028. Both state commissions are expecting these filings as both issued recent orders directing us to do so.  These filings will be made in the mid to late November time frame. We're also very pleased with the outcome of the strategic review and know that the future owner of our Kentucky assets will be a great steward for all stakeholders in Kentucky, our value employees, customers, and certainly the communities. Lastly, I want to thank all the Kentucky employees and the corporate support employees for their patience, during this review and for their continued focus on safety and operational excellence during this period, and as the transaction is completed. Now, moving to several of the regulatory activities. In Ohio, we expect an order in the fourth quarter on the settlement reached and filed with the Commission earlier this year. As a reminder of the settlement has broad support from the settling parties, including the commission staff, Ohio consumers\u2019 counsel, Industrial companies, commercial companies, and other entities like Ohio Hospital Association. Additionally, AEP Ohio's grid smart Phase III settlement was filed yesterday and paves the way to continue our deployment of advanced smart grid technologies, including completion of our AMR meter rollout, the remaining 475,000 rollout customers.  The unopposed settlement with support from commission staff allows consumer's counsel and several of our largest customers demonstrates that AEP Ohio continues to maintain a great working relationship with our regulator and interested parties. Public Service Company of Oklahoma reached a settlement in the rate case with the Oklahoma staff and other parties. The settlement was presented to the commission on October 5th. The black-box settlement includes 50.7 million net increase in rates while adding another 102.7 million in base rates.  In addition to continuing the practice of allowing some interim recovery of Capex riders, the rider collecting for Maverick and Sundance North-Central wind assets was also included, in orders expected by year-end with rates reflected in November bills. In Indiana, the unfollowed base rate case on the July 1st based on a future test year model seeking 97 million in net revenue increase with a 10% ROE.  Major items included recognition of over 500 million in capital investment per year in Indiana continuation of the transmission tracker a federal tax rider in the event of a change in federal tax rates and the advancement of AMI to provide customers greater control insight into their usage. The hearing was set before the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission on December 2nd, with an order expected by April of '22. In a Southwestern Electric Power Company's jurisdictions cases are pending in Louisiana, Texas, and Arkansas.  The SWEPCO Texas Commission deliberations set for November 18th. Parties filed exceptions to the preliminary draft order issued by the hearing  and replies. So those exceptions were filed yesterday. SWEPCO is seeking a net revenue increase of $73 million with an ROE of 10.35%. Our file includes investments made from February 2018, accelerated depreciation for  plant, a strong reserve, increased vegetation management.  We expect an order in the fourth quarter with rates being retroactive back to March of '21. In SWEPCO Louisiana testimony has been filed a hearing scheduled for January of '22. A case $6 million to $73 million net revenue increase and a 10.35% ROE in order to expect between the second third quarter of '22. And so, at Arkansas, we were seeking a $56 million net revenue increase with a 10.35 ROE. The following contains with formula rate plan for subsequent years and considers the pending retirement of previously announced call net assets.  This fall, we used time to align with the North-Central in-service dates and the provided mechanism both for recovery of costs associated with the investment and flow through of the PTC in SWEPCO customers. The hearing is set for March of '22. Both SWEPCO and PSO continue to make progress to recognize the Storm Uri expenditures. As a reminder, we filed for recovery of a lack returned over 5 years in Louisiana, Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Texas.  PSO is moving forward with the state on the securitization of costs as premiering under Oklahoma law. We are continuing our efforts to secure approvals and clear clarity regarding investments necessary to with the EPA, CCR, ELG requirements. We received  to construct the CCR compliance plans in Virginia, West Virginia, and Kentucky. While West Virginia approved ELG investments, Virginia, and Kentucky did not. West Virginia has since determined it was in the public interest to move forward with EOG investments for all 3 plans and has issued an order regarding in support of West Virginia investing to preserve the option for these plants to run past 2028, approving both the investment inward cost recovery from West Virginia customers. We'll be working with our commissions to implement the West Virginia decision and making the necessary adjustments to respect each state's decision.  The Virginia Commission ask us to come back with more information, so we'll do that. We plan to lay out all the options before them, on how to satisfy their capacity needs. The Virginia PSC were approved the first-year revenue requirement of 4.8 million for broadband, which means we now have recovery for our world broadband efforts in both Virginia, and West Virginia. We continue to engage legislators and commissions, and other states and stand ready, to invest in synergistic mid-model broadband, to support advanced group technologies, and rural broadband for our communities. We also understand, it's all about execution. On September 10th, AEP began commercial operation of the 287-megawatt Maverick Wind Energy Center in North Central Oklahoma.  Maverick was one of three wind projects that composed the North Central energy facilities, which will provide 1485 megawatts of clean energy to customers of our PSO and SWEPCO subsidiaries. The Traverse project, the largest single site wind farm in North America is well under construction and will come online in the January to April 2022 time frame. Transforming the way energy is generated, delivered, and consumed is necessary to support the needs of a clean energy economy and AEP continues to drive that transformation for the benefit of our customers and communities.  With the success of doors central setting the foundation of our future forward regulated renewables platform, we are diligently working on securing additional renewable opportunities for our customers. RFP filings are going -- are ongoing and planned in multiple states. So more to come on this as we file for approval, after resources, as a result of the RFP that were out in the market for which some of you probably have heard of, we will be able to provide greater detail on the progress being made.  Further, if federal efforts through the various tax proposals to extend and expand PTCs, ITCs for Clean Energy Resources succeed, even more benefits will be enjoyed by our customers. So now, we move quickly to the equalizer char now at this point, and I'll go quickly through this. So far, the average with the overall regulated operations is currently 9%. We generally target in the 9.5% to 10% range. So obviously we continue to work on that. AP Ohio came in at 9.3% for the third quarter, as blow authorized primarily due to timely recovery of capital investments, partially offset by higher O&M expenses. We expect that ROE to trend around authorized levels, as we maintain concurrent capital recovery of distribution, transmission investments. We also, as I mentioned earlier, expect the commission order here in the fourth quarter of '21. After it came in at 7.3%, as below authorized due to higher amortization, primarily related to what's hard coal-fired-generating assets, and higher depreciation from increase Virginia depreciation rates and capital investment. And as you know, we are still at the Appeals Court appealing -- the Virginia Supreme Court, which is currently outstanding.  We filed appeal with that Virginia Supreme Court, so we're still waiting on that. As far as Kentucky is concerned, 6.9% below authorized due to loss of load from weak economic conditions and loss of major customers. Transmission revenues were also lower due to the delay in some capital projects. I&M came in at 10.3%. It's rare that's authorized ROE primarily due to increase in sales, partially offset by increased OEM and depreciation expenses associated with items continued capital investment programs. As far as PSO is concerned, came in at 7.6%. It's below its authorized level primarily due to increased capital investment currently not in base rates and higher than anticipated equity due to the extreme February winter weather event. And of course, we expect the commission order here on the rate case in the fourth quarter of '21. SWEPCO came in at 8.2% as well authorized due to increased capital investment currently not in base rates and the continued impact of the Arkansas share of the Turk plant that is not in retail rates.  The Turkish, you again, accounts for about 110 basis points that we're not recovering in Arkansas. Again, as I mentioned earlier, we expect various commission orders, and particularly in Texas, in the fourth quarter of 2021, it's retroactive back to March. API Texas came in at 8.2% as below authorized primarily due to the significant level of investment in Texas. And of course, we have favorable regulatory treatment there with that annual DCOS and bi-annual TCOS filings to recover rates.  So significant levels of investment in Texas will continue to impact the ROE. But the expectation is for the ROE to trend towards an authorized 9.4% in the longer-term. AEP Transmission Holdco came in at 11.2%. It was above authorized primarily driven by differences between actual and forecasted expenses. The transfer will benefit from a forward-looking formula rate mechanism, which helps minimize regulatory lag, and that forecasted dollar rate is around 11% in 2021. So overall, continue to make progress.  Cases, obviously, we're waiting to hear the results of several cases that should provide some additional benefits, but that work continues. So, in closing, we are executing all  and continue to drive the results expected of a premium regulated utility. The AEP portfolio is one that has enabled our investments in the wire side of the business supporting our transmission investments, including the $0.33 per share this quarter, through our AEP trends -- transmission Holdco investments.  Our plan to transition our generation fleet and reduce carbon emissions by 80% by 2030 and net 0 by 2050 is well underway with 2 of our 3 wind facilities of our 2 billion investment in North-Central land under our belt, providing a solid foundation for the next decade of growth. Throughout this transition, we remain engaged in a trusted voice on energy transformation efforts, helping to ensure responsible transition to clean energy economy.  And we will continue to support Federal efforts in that regard and State efforts as well. Finally, our strong quarter performance gives us the confidence again, to set our midpoint at 470, or the range of 465 to 475. And we continue to have all 17,000 employees dedicated to our customers and communities to enable the strong performance. Our discipline and controlling cost, our progress to manage the portfolio, and the significance of our future organic growth opportunities provides us with a confidence needed, in raising the midpoint and nearing the guidance range.  Two weeks ago, I was really struck by the half time performance of the Ohio State Buckeyes marching band. They set their goals in my opinion, really high. Never do I expect to see a marching band dedicate their halftime show to the music of Rash (ph), to hear Tom saw your yyz(ph), the limelight and others, was truly amazing when they are difficult to even play. even though they were also marching while designing guitar players, drones, and other choreography on the field. The creativity and the execution came through to deliver a truly remarkable show.  It made me think of our team at AEP, on November 11th, I've been AEP CEO for 10-years, I'm fortunate to lead a great Company with great people who have an outstanding track record of delivering on the promises made to investors and customers consistently year in and year out. And we fully expect to continue our drive to take this Company to the next level toward the clean energy economy and a solid infrastructure foundation bucks-rating aggressive goals and delivering with creativity and solid execution. With that, I will turn it over to Julie. Julie Sloat : Thanks so much, Nick. Thanks, Darcy. And Nick I love your Buckeye reference. Go Bucks. Nick Akins : I love that. Julie Sloat : Thank you very much. Big game this weekend. Anyway, it's good to be with everybody this morning. I'm going to walk us through the third quarter and year-to-date financial results. I'll share some updates on our service territory load, and finish with some commentary on financing plans, credit metrics, and liquidity. Let's go to slide six, which shows the comparison of GAAP top rating earnings for the quarter and year-to-date periods.  GAAP earnings for the third quarter were $1.59 per share, compared to a $1.51 per share in 2020. GAAP earnings through September were $3.90 per share compared to $3.56 per share in 2020. There's a reconciliation of GAAP to operating earnings on Pages 14 and 15 of the presentation today. Let's go to Slide 7 where we can talk about our quarterly operating earnings performance by segment. Operating earnings for the third quarter totaled $1.43 per share or $717 million compared to $1.47 per share or $728 million in 2020. Operating earnings from the vertically integrated utilities were $0.87 per share, up $0.02. Favorable drivers included, rate changes across multiple jurisdictions, weather primarily in the West, transmission revenue and lower income tax.  These items were offset somewhat by higher O&M expenses to in part to lower prior year O&M, which included actions we took to adjust to the pandemic and higher depreciation expense, as well as lower normalized margins and lower AFUDC. The Transmission and Distribution Utilities segment earned $0.31 per share flat to last year. Favorable drivers in this segment included rate changes, transmission revenue, and income taxes.  Offsetting these favorable items were O&M expenses again, a function of lower prior year O&M associated with pandemic growing efforts, depreciation, and property taxes. The AEP Transmission Holdco segment continued to grow, contributing $0.33 per share, that was an improvement of $0.05, driven by the return-on-investment growth. Generation and Marketing produced $0.04 per share, down $0.09 from last year, includes by the prior-year land sales, lower retail volumes and margins, generation and income taxes.  Finally, Corporate and other was down $0.02 per share driven by lower investment gains, and unfavorable net interest expense, which was partially offset by lower income taxes. The lower investment gains, are related to a pullback of some of the ChargePoint related gains, we've talked about on prior quarters. Let's have a look at our year-to-date results on slide number 8. Operating earnings through September totaled $3.76 per share, or $1.9 billion compared to $3.56 per share, or $1.8 billion in 2020.  Looking at the drivers by segment, operating earnings for vertically integrated utilities, were $1.87 per share down $0.03, due to higher O&M and depreciation expenses. Other smaller decreases included lower normalized sales and wholesale load, higher other taxes, and a prior period fuel adjustment. Offsetting these unfavorable variances were weight changes across various operating companies and the impact of weather due to warmer than normal temps in the winter of 2020 and the summer 2021, which created a favorable year-over-year comp for us.  Other favorable items in this segment included higher off-system sales, transmission revenue, net interest expense, and income taxes. The transmission and distribution utilities segments earned $0.85 per share, up a penny from last year. Earnings in this segment were up due to higher transmission revenue, rate changes, weather, normalized load, and income taxes. Partially offsetting these favorable items were increased depreciation, O&M, other taxes, and interest expenses. AEP Transmission Holdco segment contributed $1.02 per share up $0.27 from last year, related to investment growth and favorable year-over-year true-up. Generation and marketing produced $0.20 per share down $0.11 from last year due to favorable one-time items in the prior year relating to an Oklaunion ARO adjustment in the sale of Conesville and reduced land sales in 2021.  Higher energy margins and low expenses in the generation business offset the unfavorable  marketplaces on the wholesale business during storm yearly in February. We also saw an unfavorable result in retail due to lower power and gas margins. Income taxes were also unfavorable. Finally, Corporate matter was up $0.06 per share driven by investment gains and lower taxes and partially offset by higher O&M. Let me take a quick minute here to talk about the investment gain, which is predominantly a function of our direct and indirect Investment ChargePoint. As you'll see on the waterfall, was produced a $0.06 benefit year-to-date in 2021, as compared to the corresponding 2020 period. You may recall that in the fourth quarter at full-year 2020, this investment produced a $0.05 contribution, and we would expect the year-over-year bids to be more pronounced at this point in 2021, as we have no benefit during the same period in 2020.  Turning to Page 9, I'll update you on our normalized low performance for the quarter. We, then, get into the specifics. Let me start by reminding everyone that everything you see on the slide is showing year-over-year growth. That means these numbers can be influenced by what was going on last year or what is happening now in 2021. Given all that occurred in the economy last year, it's obvious that these growth rates are at least partially being influenced by the comparison basis. This leads to the natural follow-up question like, how does today's low compare to pre -pandemic level? And I'll get to that question on the next slide. But before I do, let's take a look what a -- at what our normalized low growth was for the quarter. Starting in the upper left corner, normalized residential sales were down 1.6% compared to last year, bringing the year-to-date declined down to 9/10 of a percent.  That means that last year, residential sales were up 3.8% in the third quarter when the economy was just starting to reopen. One year later, they're down only 1.6%, which suggests there has been a shift up in residential sales, as more businesses have embraced a remote workforce for jobs that can be performed at home. The last item to point out on the residential charges that you'll notice that we added a new bar to the right, showing our latest projection for 2021 based on the load forecast update. The original guidance assumed residential sales would decrease by 1.1% in 2021. The latest update showed an improvement as we now expect residential to end the year down 9/10 of a percent. Moving right, weather-normalized commercial sales increased by 5%, bringing the year-to-date growth up to 4.3%. Last year's third quarter commercial sales were down 4.6%. So again, we're seeing a net positive stories of commercial sales classes bouncing back faster than expected. And while we're seeing a strong bounce back and the sector's most impacted by the pandemic such as schools, churches, and hotels, we're actually seeing the strongest growth in commercial sales this year from growth in data centers, especially in the Central Ohio. To give you some perspective, last year, the sector was the 9th largest commercial sector across the AP system. Today, it's the 6th largest, and will likely move further up in the rankings as more data center loads are expected to come in online over the next several years.  You will also notice that our latest load forecast update now suggests that commercial sales were end-year up 3.7% as opposed to the 0.5% decline assumed in the original guidance forecast. The economy has recovered much faster than we originally assumed, which is one of the reasons why we've updated the forecast and ensuring an improvement in that regard. In the lower left corner, you'll see that industrial sales also had a very strong quarter.  Industrial sales for the quarter increased by 7%, bringing the year-to-date up to 4.2%. Industrial sales were up at every operating Company in nearly every sector. I point out, however, that the 7% growth in the third quarter this year did not quite offset the 7.8% decline experienced last year. Which means we still have a little more room to grow before the industrial class fully recovers from the pandemic recession. The good news is we have a lot of momentum to work with.  The latest node update now projects industrial sales will end the year up 4.3%, which is 2.4% higher than assumed in the original guidance forecast. Finally, when you put it all together in the lower left corner, you'll see that normalized retail sales increased by 3% for the quarter and were up 2.3% for the first 9 months. But all indications that recovery from the pandemic and recession is happening faster than expected and our service territory is positioned to benefit from future economic growth. You'll recall that the original guidance forecast assumed normalized load growth of 2/10 of a percent in 2021. Based on our latest update, we're now expecting to end the year up 2.2%, which is a supporting factor in narrowing our earnings guidance range, and raising the midpoint for 2021. Turning to Slide 10, I want to answer the question from earlier, that asked how our current low performance compares to pre -pandemic levels. This bar chart is designed to answer that question. The blue bars are the same year-to-date bars that we shared on the prior page. As a reminder, these represent growth versus 2020, which was influenced by the restrictions implemented to manage the public health crisis. The orange bars here show how the year-to-date sales in 2021 compared to 2019, which was the most recent pre - pandemic year for comparison. These bars tell us how close we are to a full recovery from the pandemic. Starting at the left, you'll notice that a reported residential sales are down 9/10 of a percent compared to last year, but they're actually up 1.6% compared to our pre -pandemic levels. This is a gauge for how our customers behaviors have changed since the pandemic, with more people working from home.  The next bar shows that while commercial sales are up 4.3% compared to last year. There are still 8/10 of the percent below the pre -pandemic levels. Given the recent growth we're seeing, especially in the data center nodes, we would expect commercial sales to fully recover nearly soon. Moving further, right, you can notice that while the industrial sales were up 4.2% compared to last year, they are still 3% lower than pre -pandemic levels.  Given some of the headwinds for manufacturing today with supply chain disruptions, later shortages, et cetera, it may take a little longer before the industrial quest fully recovers from the pandemic recession. But we do expect to eclipse the pre -pandemic levels in 2022. In total, our normalized load is up 2.3% compared to last year and is now within 7/10 of a percent of being fully recovered from the pandemic, so it's safe to say that we're pleased with the strength and balance of this recovery in the AEP system. Let's check on the Company's capitalization and liquidity on Page 11.  On a GAAP basis, our debt-to-capital ratio decreased 0.4% from the prior quarter to 62.2%. When adjusted for the storm during event, the ratio is slightly lower than it was at year-end 2022, sorry 2020, and now stands at 61.5%. Let's talk about our FFO to debt metric, as in the first and second quarter. Effective storm yearly continues to have a temporary and noticeable impact, on this 2021 metric. Taking a look at the upper right quadrant on this page, you'll see our FFO to debt metrics based on traditional Moody's and GAAP calculated basis. As well as an adjusted Moody's and GAAP calculated basis. On a traditional unadjusted basis, our FFO - to -debt ratio increased by 0.9% during the quarter to 10.2% on a Moody's basis. And just, again, reiterate, radio agencies continue to take the anticipated recovery into consideration as it relates to our credit ratings. So very important to note that. On an adjusted basis, the Moody's FFO-to-debt metric is 13.6%.  This figure removes or adjusts the calculation to eliminate the impact of approximately 1.2 billion of cash outflows associated with covering the unplanned urine-driven fuel and purchase power in the SPP region, directly impacting PSO and SWEPCO in particular. The metric is also adjusted to remove the effect of the associated debt we used to fund the unplanned payments. This should give you a sense of where we would be from a business - as -usual perspective with that 13.6%. Importantly, as Nick mentioned, the recovery of the  fuel and purchase power expense in the PSO and SWEPCO jurisdictions is well underway and we're making progress. As a result, inconsistent with what we have previously communicated, we still anticipate our cash flow metrics to return to below the mid-teens target range next year. Obviously, we are trying to push towards the mid-teens range, but that will take us a little while longer, but we're definitely on our way there.  And as you know, we'll keep you posted on our progress. Before we leave the Balance Sheet topic, I do want to make note of the intended change to our 2022 financing plan, in light of our announced sale of Kentucky Power and Kentucky Transco. You may recall that we had planned to issue $1.4 billion of equity in 2022, that's inclusive of $100 million dividend reinvestment plan to fund our growth Capex program, where we will provide our typical 3-year forward annual review of our cash flows and financial metrics at the upcoming EEI Conference, where we can expect to see is that the 2022 forecast will be adjusted to eliminate the previously planned $1.4 billion of equity financing that I just mentioned with any residual proceeds being used to reduce a small portion of the 2022 debt financing that we had planned.  These actions will have no impact on our previously stated credit metric targets or messaging in that regard. On the slide deck today, on page 39, you'll see our current cash flow forecast, with which you are already familiar, We've included a note on the side to reflect the fact that the numbers have not been updated for the announced Kentucky transaction, along with the red circle around the 2022 financing -- equity financing amount that will be changed and updated when we roll out the new view in a couple of weeks in conjunction with the EEI conference.  So, while we're talking about the Kentucky transaction, I can also share that we expect that the sale will be $0.01 to $0.02 accretive in 2022, and we will reflect this in our 2022 earnings guidance that we provide to you at the EEI Conference. Okay. So back to our regularly-scheduled earnings call programming and commentary. Let's take a quick moment to visit our liquidity summary on the lower right slot -- side of Slide 11.  Our 5-year $4 billion bank revolver and 2-year $1 billion revolving credit facility, along with proceeds from the quarter-end debt issuance, support our liquidity position, which means we were strong at $5.1 billion. If you look at the lower left side of the page, you will see that our qualified pension continues to be well funded at a 104%. Additionally, our OPEB is funded at a 173.9%. Let's go slide 12 and I'll do a quick wrap up and we can get to your questions.  Our performance through the first 3 quarters of this year gives us confidence to narrow our operating guidance to the upper half of our current range, resulting in the new range of $4.65 per share to $4.75 per share with a midpoint of $4.70 per share. As we stated, we are committed to our long-term growth, rate target of 5% to 7%. Today's 2021 earnings guidance revision is yet another demonstration of our drive to deliver performance in the upper half of our guidance range. From a strategic perspective, we're making significant progress in addressing items that are top of mind for our current and perspective investors. We're mounting contract to sell Kentucky Power and Kentucky Transco, which we expect to complete in the second quarter of 2022. This transaction enables us to avoid the 1.4 billion equity issuance, that was part of our original forecast, would share with you for 2022. Therefore, alleviates the overhang, the equity overhang. Also allows us to deliver transaction that we estimate to be 1 to 2  in 2022.  We will be more able to do this, while concurrently preserving our ability to get our FFO to debt metrics comfortably, into that mid to low teens range by 2022, which is commensurate with a Moody's BAAT stabilizing, as we continue to target that. The intention is to remain in this credit metric range. Again, with a preference to try to get closer to that midpoint, as we move along in time. All of this positions us to continue our generation transformation, which is underpinned by the renewable investment opportunity we have shared with you in complemented by our ongoing energy delivery investment.  So here you can expect to see from us at the upcoming EEI Conference in early November. In addition to the updated 3-year forward cash flow and financing plan, we'll be introducing and sharing the details behind our 2022 Earnings Guidance and our longer-term capital plan, we typically got out 5 years, all of which will incorporate the effects of the announced Kentucky sales. So, with that, surely, we do appreciate your time and attention and I'm going to turn it over to the operator so we can get to your questions. Operator : Thank you.  Also please, take up your handset before pressing any buttons. We will go first to the line of Julien Dumoulin Smith. Your line is open. Go ahead, please. I'm sorry. I'm having some technical difficulty, one moment while we open your line. Your line is open. Go ahead, please. Julien Dumoulin Smith : Thank you. Can you hear me now? Nick Akins : Hey you doing and how you? Julien Dumoulin Smith : Hey, quite well. Thank you. Congratulations on the transaction there. Nicely done. Nick Akins : Yeah, I'm angst. Julien Dumoulin Smith : Absolutely. So perhaps just to dive into that one a little bit more, can you talk about what happens with the Mitchell plant here, just as a function of the sale, will it get transferred to Wheeling, how are you thinking about that vis -a - vis liberty, and any kind of pricing there, and in terms of transfer, what have you? Nick Akins : Yes. That's why the operating agreement is being followed. Wheeling would become the operator and it does get transferred to Wheeling in 2028. And so that's really -- we're continuing with Kentucky being half-owner of Mitchell until that period of time. So, the Wheeling will take over the operations of the plant, the employees will move over to wheeling as well. And then we'll continue working with the West Virginia and Kentucky commission to get resolved the operating agreement and related issues.  And then, of course, at the end -- at 2028, it transfers over at fair market value . So that's the plan. And that will get followed here in November and December time frame and we'll go through that. And actually, both commissions have the incentive to get this resolved because we do have various views of the ELG piece of it. So regardless of whether we had this transaction or not, we would be needing to fall for the operating agreement change out just because the different directions of the commissions have gone. So, we'll get that resolved as part of process to the overall approvals. Julien Dumoulin Smith : Excellent. Nicely said -- nicely done. Fair market value it is. And then just vis -a - vis, ongoing transactions in portfolio evaluation of really a review with the equity means here in the very near-term, how do you think about just continued evaluation a portfolio? I mean, clearly, it's not necessarily a near-term dynamic, but want to give you the opportunity to speak to that a little bit further. Nick Akins : Yes, sure. I said over and over, I guess for a couple of years now but even beyond that. We do have to get to portfolio management to enable us to look at the sources and uses of the capital needs that we have. And to manage the balance sheet, as Julie has mentioned. We target the mid-teens, and we want to get there, and obviously, we're well on our way of getting there. So, we want to do that, but at the same time, be able to fund the capital growth.  And when you think about it, we've sold the unregulated generation, we sold Rover Rob's, we sold some hydro-related facilities. With Kentucky, we're talking about 6 billion of assets that have been sold, but they fueled substantial growth. I mean, to the tune of 7 billion a year in capital. It's part of the process to determine what the portfolio, needs to be in the future and we will continue to do that.  Certainly, we have Chuck, and Julie, and others will continue to review that portfolio, and we will manage it in a proper way. I'll say this, Kentucky Power, you think about the threshold -- at one point we talked about we always invested in coal units no matter what. And, obviously, we've changed that focus to make sure it's more deliveries of in terms of the decision points that are made. It's quite a move for AEP to get to a point where we're managing our portfolio in a way that, first of all, we became fully regulate, and then we start to look at that portfolio to determine what's the best approach to fuel 20 billion in potential renewables investment.  So, when you think about that, we have to consider it. And I can tell you, the last time we sold a regulated utility was, I guess, the Scranton Pennsylvania System, and then the Pennsylvania -- in Pennsylvania and the New Jersey system back in the 1940s and 50s. So, it's a pretty substantial change. And when you think about Kentucky Power sales, it was one of the first acquisitions of American Gas and Electric in 1922. So, by the time we get through this, it's been 100 years. So, when you think about the threshold level of portfolio management that has occurred in this Company, it really should show a lot on terms of our seriousness of making sure that we're managing that portfolio in the proper way. That's probably longer answer than what you asked for, but I want ed to at least get all that out there. Julien Dumoulin Smith : Very much appreciate it. I'll leave it there. Speak with you guys soon. Nick Akins : Okay. Operator : We'll next go to the line of Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Go ahead, please. Nick Akins : Good morning, Shahriar. Shahriar Pourreza : Good morning, guys and congrats on Kentucky. Nick Akins : Yes. Shahriar Pourreza : Just a follow-up on Julien's question a little bit more. As we think about trigger points for another asset sale what's kind of a catalyst because the 10-gigawatts of solar wind that you're looking to build through '25. I mean, even if you assume a 50-50 on PPA structure could yield an incremental $3 billion rate of spending opportunities. And you obviously have a slope of IRP. So do you need to see affirmations with the various filings or actual approvals in GRC. So how should we think about how these could be funded, especially in light of where the stock trades. So, yes. Nick Akins : When you think about the way we're approaching the renewables fees, that the process has been, that we term the need for equity associated with those particular investments, when they actually come online and we get regulated recovery. So, we get the cash flow to support, those investments at the time they come online. That means, obviously our FFO to debt doesn't suffer as a result of that. So, if we continue that approach, and keep in mind too, I've always said that, for us to take a look at a regulated entity or other parts of our portfolio, doesn't match the future needs in terms of, where we are and where we're going as a Company.  Is there, if we have a chronically under-performing part of the portfolio, then it's important for us to take a look at. That may be temporary, it could be long term, but certainly we have to make sure that we're evaluating each one of these assets in a way that says, okay. It doesn't matter where it's located, as long as we're getting certainly the return expectation and also the forward view of the utility is positive as compared to with others. So, we have to compare in various parts of our service territories and that's where we make those decisions. Shahriar Pourreza : Perfect. And then just Nick, appreciate we're going to head into EEI we'll get an update here. But do you see the current renewable additions at least through '25 the 10 gigawatts, right, between solar and wind swinging materially with some of these counteractive items like federal policy benefits versus the input cost pressures we're seeing in the space impacting some project timings. So, do you see any of this swinging at all? Nick Akins : Yeah, I do. And in your -- when we'd actually go do the analysis and we've done analysis for all the jurisdictions, but conditions changed, low changes certainly PTCs, ITCs can change as a result, which changed the business cases were some may have been on the margins particularly in the east now become benefits to customers. So, I think those numbers will continue to change and I can tell you from what I've seen so far. Those numbers will change. And some will go out, some will go down. But overall, normally, it should be on path, what we've talked about.  And we'll have more to report on that. Probably during first quarter '22, because we'll have the integrated resource plans. And when those integrated resource plans are filed, that's where I mentioned today is you will have a more definitive view of what those projects look like because there will be the results of RFPs and there will be the results of actual projects that are put in for regulated approval. So, more definition, but I would certainly say that normally they will be in that category we've previously discussed. Julie Sloat : And sure. What you should anticipate is when we go to EEI, you'll see a refreshed 5-year forward Capex plan, so '22 through '26, and you'll start to begin to see a little bit more of this renewable opportunity dropped in. So, stay tuned for that, and we'll be able to talk more granularly with you here in a couple of weeks. Nick Akins : Yeah. And I would say that when you see that, it certainly will reflect, I don't know if you call it a risk-adjusted approach or whatever, but it's a nominal view for us to make financing plans, and then just like with North Central, we make decisions on whether it goes up or down based upon our ownership. Shahriar Pourreza : Got it. Cheers to you guys. Congrats on the results. See you soon. Nick Akins : Thank you. Operator : We will next go to the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Go ahead, please. Steve Fleishman : Hey, good morning. Can you hear me, Nick? Nick Akins : Yes. Yes. I hear you. Steve Fleishman : Okay, great. Thanks. Okay. One question that might be a bit premature, but there's obviously a lot going on in DC with the reconciliation bill and the like, and one of the provisions that's gotten more focused on this few days is the minimum tax provision. And I just be curious, how you're thinking -- for larger companies like yourself, how you're thinking if that has any impact for largely regulated utility like you or does it not really have much of an impact? Nick Akins : Well, I would say, and we've been vocal about this and the industry has been vocal about it, if you put a minimum 15% tax and a lot of us are, as you know, heavy on capital, and its growth capital, and it's also infrastructure-related capital. So, an increase with the minimum tax would certainly have an accruing effect on our ability to continue with not only development of infrastructure and having effect on that, not to mention customers\u2019 bills ultimately because the taxes were passed through to our customers.  But also, the administration has a focus on green energy and it will have an effect on renewables transformation that's existing as well. So, I think I think they'll put a pail over all the utilities\u2019 ability to continue invest in capital in the way that we are. Now, if we do that, then obviously there's customer impact associated with it. And again, it's a hidden tax on our customers. So, we're not for that provision. I think actually, we've been very worthwhile about this and trying to be an honest broker when we're talking about CEBP and all the other things that -- it was important for us to be able to make this transformation from a clean energy standpoint.  Certainly, the PTCs, ITCs with expansion of long-term storage, nuclear, and certainly in terms of wind and solar, are very important to continue those process, to move to clean energy economy, and we can go a long way there. This industry is very focused on doing that, and any kind of tax headwind that goes the other direction is not helpful. I think you probably hear that across-the-board. Steve Fleishman : Okay. More to direct AP things. Just on the approval for the Kentucky sale, could you remind us what the standard for approval is in Kentucky? Is it just in the public interest or that benefits? Nick Akins : Yes. But it's in the public interest, obviously. Because they have to look at the suitor and determine is that the right route approach. And as I've done in the proper way and actually there has been some discussions in Kentucky previously. I think it's probably gone past some of that now that -- I want to make sure we were operating Kentucky the way we should. And we've been operating it the way we always have. So, we've been investing, we've been doing the things that we need to do. Whether we owned it or not. And I think certainly the buyer has recognized that and during the transition, we will continue to support a smooth transition to ensure that the services provided and things that need to be done to make Kentucky Power successful, we'll be there to do it. And of course, we'll support Liberty Utilities in Algonquin in doing that. Steve Fleishman : Great. And then one just quick question maybe for Julie. The proceeds from the Kentucky sale look like they're matching up one for one with reducing the equity need. But obviously when you sell an asset, you lose some cash flow, albeit Kentucky maybe wasn't having the best cash flow. So, are there offsets in other businesses that are making up for the lost cash flow from the asset sale? Julie Sloat : Yes, thanks for the question, Steve. You're right. I mean, we do lose the funds from operations that relates to Kentucky and Kentucky Transco. Although, we got to keep in mind that we also eliminate about $1.3 billion of debt associated with those assets to because that goes away. And the marathon that we think through, just to take it a step further is if we avoid issuing equity, we avoid having to cover off additional dividends that were in our original plan.  So, another to a sidestep that as well. And that comes with, maybe also having some additional dollars to reduce debt. As I mentioned in my opening comments, anything above and beyond that $1.4 billion which channeled toward debt reduction that was otherwise planned for 2022. And then also, keep in mind that Kentucky Power had barely strained FFO - to -debt to begin with. So, to eliminate that piece of, I guess, drag to the overall average FFO -to-debt for their organization is also a net positive for us.  So, we are able to put these numbers together. And quite frankly, from an FFO - to -debt perspective, it is mildly beneficial and obviously a little bit of a cost on the debt-to-cap because we're not issuing additional equity. But the numbers all do hang together and coincidentally we'll be able to take literally that $1.4 billion of planned equity out of the plan, and again, you'll see that at EEI when we'll refresh the forecast. Steve Fleishman : Great. Thanks so much. Nick Akins : Thanks, Steve. Operator : Well let's go to the line of Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Go ahead, please. Nick Akins : Morning, Durgesh. Durgesh Chopra : Hey, good morning, Nick. Maybe just along the FFO-to-debt lines, my first question is to Julie. In terms of 2024, I'm thinking about your equity needs in my model shift used to target for FFO to debt. Actually, is it mid-teens or is it low to your ? Because, obviously, that's going to dictate, right, how much equity you might need in 2024. So, any color you could share there? Julie Sloat : Got you. You'll see 2024 when we rollout our EEI guidance, so 3 years forward. But, as we continue to say, we are talking about mid - to -low teens. And the reason I say that is, as I mentioned today, if you look at our FFO to debt on an adjusted basis, so backing out the yearly consequence, we have something like 13.6% on a Moody's basis. As you know, our target has been to be around that Baa2 stable rating.  That's why we talk about mid - to -low teens or low - to -mid teens. Obviously, our preference and our expectation are to start to push more towards what I would characterize as mid. It'd be nice to have at least a 14 handle on that FFO to debt, and that is absolutely the plan, but we'll be able to share more with you as we get to EEI and build that forecast, but I wouldn't change how you're thinking about it. So, thinking about mid to low teens as it relates to Moody's BAAT, with a preference towards 14 plus percent. Durgesh Chopra : Got it. So, some of that moment to low teens through 2024 yeah. A big picture question, we've talked in depth about natural gas prices. So maybe just talk about your gas generation portfolio, fuel costs, any hedges in impacting customer bills? Julie Sloat : I will take this from a customer rate perspective as I could, because that's how we think about it. Because ultimately this impacts our customers. When we think about, for example, a decent sensitivity analyses around, let's say a 10% hike in natural gas prices as we all know, they've gone up substantially. The impact to customer rates varies significantly from 1 operating Company to the next, depending on the field mix.  So, for example, if I looked at Appalachian Power Company, the average residential impact price in terms of the 10% hiking gas prices would equate to about a 0.9% increase in the customer's rate. Let's compare and contrast that to say PSO or SWEPCO, whether there's much more gas concentration. So PSO, we'd be talking about 1.6% increase in customer rates. SWEPCO, 1.5%. So, this is something we're very sensitive to, because as you know, overall, we're extremely sensitive to customer rate increases and the aggregate as we continue to execute on our general Capex program. I don't know if -- Nick, you had any additional comments. Nick Akins : I'd say certainly, your question actually shows the reinforcement of our renewable\u2019s transformation because it's a perfect edge to natural gas of North Central were in place during the time of storm Yuri. It would have saved customers $225 million. So, when you think about the process we're going through, it's great to have natural gas it's -- and certainly -- but at the times where you can layer in renewables to do that, it turns out to be a significant benefit to consumers. So, it reinforces that. And I think probably this winter will show it. Durgesh Chopra : Understood. Thanks, guys. I appreciate the time. Julie Sloat : Thank you. Operator : We'll next go to the line of Andrew Weisel with Deutsche Bank. Go ahead, please. Nick Akins : Good morning, Andrew. Andrew Weisel : Hey, good morning. Thanks for a lot of good updates here. One remaining question I had was after a few rate case settlements and expectations for several other outstanding cases to be resolved in the coming months, can you share your expectations around which sub we might file new rate cases over the next 12 months or so? Nick Akins : We are -- I'm trying to think of what else will you be filling because just down here with jurisdiction we got a case that we expect approval of and certainly a lot of cases they're still ongoing and just about all the jurisdictions. So, I'd say we're always reviewing that on a regular basis at this point. We are playing with active cases that we got to get across the finish line and then determine where we are at. The other part here is looking at what happens with denominator because Julie mentioned, low is changing significantly and it continues to do that as we emerge from hopefully a post-COVID world. And if that's the case, then that would be a determinant in terms of when we would file for any case. I think, of course, if we do have tax changes that occur, then that'll force a whole new view going forward to many of these cases. Just like it did when we got tax reform last time around, except this one, maybe, on the upside. Andrew Weisel : Okay, great. So, would it be fair to say that '22 at least the other second half of '22 might be a quieter year as far as the regulatory calendar than what we currently have? Nick Akins : Probably quieter in terms of filings, but probably noisy in terms of results. Andrew Weisel : Alright. Thank you very much. Operator :  We will go on next, one, please. We'll go next to the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Go ahead, please. Michael Lapides : My name  I'm fine. Rough year for your -- by you being goals this year. A lot of change. Hey, got a couple of questions for you. What the Kentucky sale and you guys have -- your slide number five. I think it says, over the years has done a good job of detailing how hard it's been on authorized in Kentucky.  Now that Kentucky will be offshore play, when you look at the other jurisdictions, what are the ones that we say, hey, we still struggle to own authorize here? What are the structural changes? Whether it's legislation and we've seen lots of utilities in places like North Carolina, Kansas, Missouri, go in and make structural changes via legislation. What are the structural changes you are going to seek, outside of just normal rate case filings, that could help improve authorized versus  in those jurisdictions. Nick Akins : You're seeing a fundamental shift and all the remaining operating companies. We made a lot of progress on Ryder's and we have a lot of focus on getting concurrent recovery in cash in the door and what you're seeing really in terms of a lot of these lags, is the amount of investment that we're placing in these companies. But as well as you make the transition from certainly from wires related activities with Ryder's and then the renewables conversion that occurs, the way we're doing the renewables is commensurate with the recovery.  So, we should see the authorized -- our returns be closer to the authorized as time goes forward. We don't see any fundamental issues in any of the jurisdictions that are left that says that we have significant headwinds. I mean, the only thing you could probably point to is the Turk issue at SWEPCO, but other than that -- and actually, when you think about Arkansas, we keep saying we're not recovering the Arkansas portion of the Turk. That's not because of the commission. That is because of the Supreme Court of Arkansas.  So, we've got very good relations with the commissions and all the jurisdictions, and we feel like the fundamentals are there for continued improvement relative to that regulatory lag that exists. And because we're spending on more areas and our generation is really renewables, and that's helping out, every time we put an investment in, and the timing of the investment improves the FFO-to-debt, improves the returns of the individual companies. And I think we'll continue to make progress in that regard. So, I would be -- I'm pretty optimistic that we'll continue to make progress in all of these jurisdictions. Michael Lapides : Got it. And just a quick follow-up, and just maybe a Julie one. Just curious when we think about your multi-year -- your guidance growth rate and the language around wanting to be at the high end, outside of the transmission segment, the standalone segment, what does that embed as an earned ROE at the rest of the regulated businesses? Julie Sloat : Michael, we always -- as Nick mentioned, we strive to be in the upper half of the guidance range, not necessary the upper end, although that 'd be very nice. So just a point of clarification there. And as it relates to returns, as you can see, we've kind of been hovering around the 9% ROE return level. I think that's a safe place for you to assume that we'll kind of hang out there for a while until we get a little more traction.  And the other thing if I could, circling back to your original question, when we look at the equalizer chart, often times we get questions around AEP taxes and why the lower  we relative to authorize there, and so back to your question around growth and how do you manage the business, AEP Texas, we continue to invest a significant amount of capital on an annualized basis.  And while we have very progressive rate recovery mechanisms in place that we really enjoy, I can tell you this, while the ROE may look a touch depressed relative to authorize, that Company continues to produce earnings growth and to save the 8% to 10% range. So that certifies our ability, back to your original point, getting that upper 1/2 of the range. So again, ROE, our system-wide average, assume roughly around 9% - ish and trending upward over time. And then around AEP Texas, k keeps in mind, the capital is intentional there as we continue to try to take care of the customer and grow that business. And it's paying dividends in 8% to 10% EPS growth out of it. Nick Akins : And another thing if we look at is, we haven't gone that pages is actually the increase in equity layers as well. So, you see improvement in the equity layers and then, we're still investing and still meeting the 5% to 7% and being the upper half and that kind of thing. And of course, we continue to manage the FFO to debt towards the mid-teens. So that -- all of the pieces are starting to fit together. And there's a lot of optimization that will occur for us to -- how to execute on to ensure that we're continuing to meet the earnings objectives. But at the same time investing in the right things and enable us to bridge that gap on the regulatory lag. Michael Lapides : Got it. Thank you, guys. Much appreciated. Congrats to have Kentucky. Nick Akins : Yeah. Sure thing. Julie Sloat : Thanks. Operator : All right. Speakers, we have no one else in queue at this time. Darcy Reese : Thank you for joining us on today's call. As always, the IR team will be available to answer any additional questions you may have. Allen, would you please give the replay information? Operator : Absolutely. Ladies and gentlemen, this conference will be made available for replay beginning at 05 :30 PM today, October 28th, 2021 and lasting until November 4th, 2021 at midnight.

At this time, all lines are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session.  And as a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Darcy Reese. Please go ahead. Darcy Reese : Thank you, Cynthia. Good morning, everyone. And welcome to the fourth quarter 2021 earnings call for American Electric Power. We appreciate you taking the time to join us today. Our earnings release, presentation slides and related financial information are available on our website at aep.com. Today, we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors. Joining me this morning for opening remarks are Nick Akins, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Julie Sloat, our Chief Financial Officer. We will take your questions following their remarks. I will now turn the call over to Nick. Nick Akins : Okay. Thanks, Darcy. Welcome, everyone, to American Electric Power's fourth quarter 2021 earnings call. I'm sure you all had time to read the earnings release and have seen all that we were able to accomplish in 2021. As we saw the results of several regulatory-related cases, it actually came in after the financial last November. AEP has come into 2022 flying high. The lyrics of a song by Lionel Richie and the Commodores actually the first concert or actually catered backstage when I was younger. Flying High says, I knew we could make it from the beginning. AEP has now moved from 4% to 6% to 5% to 7% to 6% to 7% long-term growth rate because of our purposeful steps to enhance growth opportunities and derisk the AEP portfolio. This process will continue. We so have so much to look forward to in 2022. But for the purpose of today's call, I'm going to start by providing a brief recap of our financial performance and then I want to talk about the evolution and the next steps we are taking in the execution of our business strategy, as well as the impact on our financing targets as we hone in on both our regulated generation transformation and our energy delivery infrastructure investments. These are continued refinements that we believe will not only allow us to better serve our customers, but will generate enhanced value for our investors as well. Finally, I will provide an update on the various strategic and regulatory initiatives that are already underway. Starting with the recap of financial highlights, we reported strong results for the fourth quarter, navigating difficult macro headwinds while maintaining our balance sheet and increasing our quarterly dividend. In fact, this quarter was our strongest ever fourth quarter, coming in above consensus estimates with fourth quarter GAAP earnings of $1.07 per share and operating earnings of $0.98 per share bringing our GAAP and operating earnings to $4.97 per share and $4.74 per share year-to-date, respectively. Our strong financial performance in the quarter generated regulated ROE of 9.2% with improved equity layers and enabled us to increase the quarter's dividend from $0.74 to $0.78 per share as announced in October of '21. Our performance rests firmly on the regulatory foundations laid this past year with a series of rate case activity across our jurisdictions. Since EEI, we've received constructive base case orders in Ohio and Oklahoma and we reached a settlement in Indiana that the commission approved yesterday and we anticipate shortly finalizing our other base rate cases in SWEPCO and PSO. Our management team continues to make significant headway in our strategic growth plan and transformation. In 2021, the comprehensive strategic review of our Kentucky operations resulted in an agreement to sell Kentucky Power and AEP Kentucky Transco for more than $2.8 billion. After receiving the necessary regulatory approvals, we expect this sale to close in the second quarter of 2022, notwithstanding the recent withdrawal of our FERC-related - FERC filing related to the Mitchell operating agreement. The completion of this transaction is expected to net AEP approximately $1.45 billion in cash after taxes and transaction fees, proceeds we will use to invest in regulated renewables and transmission. AEP is building on a strong record of actively managing our portfolio to support our growth as we invest in a clean energy future while delivering increased returns to shareholders. An integral part of our long-term strategy is the prioritization of AEP's regulated investment opportunities and the optimization of our assets. To that end, today, we are announcing the elimination of growth capital allocated to the contracted renewables in our 2022 to 2026 forecast and our intent to ultimately sell all or a portion of our contracted renewables portfolio in our Generation & Marketing business segment to help fund our growing capital requirements in our regulated portfolio. In making this decision, our team carefully considered the renewable opportunities in the context of our competitive business, existing competition in the space, our ability to efficiently monetize the PTC's ITC tax credits as regulated opportunities come to fruition, the attention needed to manage the size of this business relative to our overall regulated business and the potential value this business represents to others who are committed to contracted renewable development and operations. We are fully confident that the sale of this portfolio will both simplify and derisk our business while allowing us to allocate proceeds and assign additional capital to our regulated business where we see a meaningful pipeline of investment opportunities to better serve our customers and participate in the energy transition. This shift in direction enables us to recalibrate our 2022 to 2026 capital plan shifting approximately $1.5 billion of investment capital to transmission and raising it to $14.4 billion of the $38 billion 5 year plan. The capital originally allocated to the unregulated generation in the marketing segment will drop from $1.7 billion of the $38 billion 5-year plan to $400 million. The remaining $400 million in the Generation & Marketing segment will be largely allocated to maintenance capital and distributed generation assets. Our investment opportunities remain dynamic. And AEP operating companies will continue to develop integrated resource plans and grid enhancement plans over the near and long term in collaboration with stakeholders. This process continues to make substantial progress as shown on slide 43 of the earnings deck. Overall, we are targeting wind additions of approximately 8.6 gigawatts of solar additions of approximately 6.6 gigawatts by 2030. For which we have allocated $8.2 billion in our current 5 year capital plan. This - the migration from contracted renewables to significant increases in regulated renewables will ensure that AEP maintains the talent and resources to execute this plan. The capital plan also includes $24.8 billion allocated to grid investments. With the changes discussed and the expected completion of the sale of Kentucky Power, we plan on an Analyst Day presentation soon after the sale is completed to further update on all of these important initiatives. Now shifting gears to our regulated renewables opportunity. AEP has a positive record of actively managing its portfolio to support the growth of the company as we invest in our regulated business and renewable generation to transform and build a cleaner, more modern energy system, and we made significant progress on our regulated renewables opportunity in 2021. Our plan is to reduce carbon emissions by 80% by 2030 and achieve net 0 by 2050 is well underway. The 998-megawatt Traverse project, the largest single wind farm built at one time in North America is in the final stages of commissioning, and we expect the facility to go on launch soon. The combined investment in the Traverse project along with Maverick and Sundance, which both became operational in 2021 represent investment in renewable energy of approximately $2 billion and will save PSO and SWEPCO customers in Arkansas, Louisiana and Oklahoma an estimated $3 billion in electricity costs over the next 30 years. These three projects add 1,484 megawatts of regulated renewable energy to our portfolio, and we recently issued RFPs for renewable resources for 1.1 gigawatts at APCo and 1.3 gigawatts at I&M. We expect to make regulatory filings and obtain the necessary approvals for projects selected from RFP processes at APCo, I&M, PSO and SWEPCO. We are truly transforming the energy grid to better integrate renewable resources, delivering the low-cost, reliable energy that our customers rely on while simultaneously empowering positive social, economic and environmental change in the communities we serve, and we believe we can successfully enhance shareholder returns in the process. Finally and significantly, I'd like to speak to a few developments that highlight the economic vitality and prospects of the communities we serve. Our economic development team has been focusing on working collaboratively with our states to drive expansion within our service territory. As you know, in January, Intel announced plans to build 2 new leading-edge chip manufacturing facilities in Ohio for an initial investment of more than $20 billion. Over in West Virginia, Nucor announced in January they will build its new $2.7 billion state of the art facility in Mason County, West Virginia. Further, TAT Technologies will be moving its thermal components activities from Israel to Tulsa bringing 900 jobs to the region. In total, our economic development team reported 1,900 megawatts of new load, supporting over 20,000 new jobs announced in 2021 and thus far in 2022. As evidenced by these wins, we are proud to play a vital part in the infrastructure that enables job-creating projects of this kind in our service territories. Moreover, in today's environment, especially in today's environment, as companies in our country focus on energy and supply chain security, our service territory is primed to benefit. We are committed to remaining a good steward for the communities in which we operate as we transition to a clean energy future. Through our just transition effort, we support affected communities through coal plants retirement, by providing job placement services for displaced workers, fact based replacement and funding sources to support diversification. This just transition program has been applied as a model for the country and enabling positive social and economic transitions for affected communities. As I said at the outset, we have a lot to look forward to in 2022. As we recast our capital allocation and derisk the business, we feel confident in lifting and tightening our earnings growth target range from 5% to 7% to 6% to 7%. It has always been my preference to be in the upper half of the 5% to 7% range. And since we have demonstrated a track record of being able to deliver on these projections year in and year out, we are electing to revise the range to 6% to 7%. Accordingly, we will be lifting our 2022 operating earnings guidance range by $0.02 to $4.87 to $5.07 per share, with a midpoint of $4.97 to reflect the increase in growth rate target range. Lastly, we are increasing our funds from operations to debt target to a range of 14% to 15% from 13.5% to 15%, which we mentioned at November EEI. Throughout this process and beyond, we will be committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet. We discussed this at November EEI and can confirm that our FFO to debt and credit metrics have improved markedly as we expected. Over the past decade, AEP has achieved impressive and sustained long-term growth, consistently meeting and exceeding earnings projections while continuing to raise guidance. Our highly qualified Board and management team are executing a strategic plan that leverages AEP's scale, financial strength, effective portfolio management and diversity of regulatory jurisdictions to deliver safe, clean and reliable services for our customers while creating significant value for all AEP shareholders. We are also committed to examining and looking beyond the traditional forms of equity to fund the growth going forward, and our track record since 2015 in asset sales have been active and produce accretive opportunities for our shareholders. Our transformation strategy is working, and the investments we are making will continue to support our solid earnings growth and results. AEP stands poised to make great headway in 2022. And continue to capitalize on this momentum. Our organic growth opportunities for the next decade and our consistent ability to execute against our plan, make it possible to set our sights high for this year and beyond. Before I hand things over to Julie, I just want to take a moment to acknowledge the unwavering commitment and dedication of our employees. In the midst of another storm-filled winter, our employees have continued to prioritize the safety and security of our customers across all of our jurisdictions with significant ice storms impacting most of our territory in the past few weeks. I have been truly humbled by their tireless efforts to deliver on our initiatives and provide for our communities. Ultimately, their passion for the work we do is what makes our business so extraordinary. With that, I'll turn things over to Julie, who is going to walk you through the financial results for the quarter. Julie? Julie Sloat : Thanks, Nick. Thank you very much. Thanks, Darcy. It's good to be with everyone this morning. Thanks for everyone - thanks, everyone, for dialing in. I'm going to walk us through the fourth quarter and full year results and then share some updates on our service territory load and then finish with some commentary on our financing plans, credit metrics and liquidity as well, some thoughts on our revised guidance, financial targets and portfolio management. So let's go to slide 10, which shows the comparison of GAAP to operating earnings for the quarter and year-to-date periods. GAAP earnings for the fourth quarter were $1.07 per share $0.88 per share in 2020. GAAP earnings for the year were $4.97 per share compared to $4.44 per share in 2020. There's a reconciliation of GAAP to operating earnings on Pages 17 and 18 of the presentation today. Let's walk through our quarterly operating earnings performance by segment, which is on Slide 11. Operating earnings for the fourth quarter totaled $0.98 per share or $496 million compared to $0.87 per share or $433 million in 2020. Operating earnings for the vertically integrated utilities were $0.39 per share, up $0.08. Favorable drivers included rate changes across multiple jurisdictions, increased transmission revenue and lower income tax. These items were somewhat offset by lower normalized growth and higher depreciation. I'll talk about load a little bit more here in a minute. The Transmission and Distribution Utilities segment earned $0.25 per share, up $0.06 compared to last year. Favorable drivers in this segment included rate changes, normalized load and transmission revenues. Offsetting these favorable items were unfavorable December weather and increased depreciation. The AEP Transmission Holdco segment continued to grow, contributing $0.33 per share, which was an improvement of $0.06 driven by the return on the investment growth. Generation and Marketing produced $0.06 per share, up $0.01 from last year, largely due to favorable income taxes, wholesale margins, offset by lower generation in land sales. Finally, Corporate and Other was down $0.10 per share, driven by lower investment gains and unfavorable income taxes. The lower investment gains are largely related to charge point gains that we had in the fourth quarter of last year. Let's have a look at our year-to-date results on Slide 12. Operating earnings for 2021 totaled $4.74 or $2.4 billion compared to $4.44 per share or $2.2 billion in 2020. Looking at the drivers by segment. Operating earnings for the vertically integrated utilities were $2.26 per share, up $0.05 due to rate changes across multiple or various operating companies, favorable weather and increased transmission revenue. Offsetting these favorable variances were higher O&M as we return to a more normal level of O&M, increased depreciation expense and lower normalized retail load primarily in the residential class. On the transmission and distribution utilities segment, they earned $1.10 per share, up $0.07 from last year. Earnings in this segment were up due to higher transmission revenue, rate changes and increased normalized retail load which is mainly in the residential and commercial classes. Offsetting these favorable variances were increases in O&M, depreciation and other taxes, essentially property taxes related to the increased investment levels. The AEP Transmission Holdco segment contributed $1.35 per share, up $0.32 from last year related to investment growth and a favorable year-over-year true-up. Generation and Marketing produced $0.26 per share, down $0.10 last - from last year, largely due to favorable onetime items in the prior year associated with the downward revision of the Oklaunion ARO liability in contemplation of the plant shut down and the sale of the Conesville plant. Additionally, while we had land sales in both years, the level of sales was lower in 2021 versus 2020. Finally, Corporate and Other was down $0.04 per share. You'll notice that we aren't talking about investment gains in the year-to-date as we had a lot of timing differences across the quarters between 2020 and 2021, but net-net, we're flat for the year. The year-over-year decline in this segment was primarily driven by slightly higher O&M, interest expense and income taxes. Let's go to slide 13 and I'll update you on our normalized load performance for the quarter. Let me begin by providing you with a couple of interesting stats that highlight the status of the recovery throughout the AEP service territory. The first is the fact that we ended the year within 0.2% of our pre-pandemic sales levels and fully expect to exceed those levels in 2022. AEP's normalized load growth in 2021 was the strongest we've experienced in over a decade driven by the historic economic recovery throughout the service territory. And to build on that, our current projection suggests that 2022 will be the second strongest year for load growth over the past decade following behind 2021. So let's start in the upper left corner. Normalized residential sales were down 1.9% compared to the fourth quarter of 2020, bringing the annual decrease in residential sales in 2021 to 1.1%. The decline was spread across every operating company. However, the decline in residential sales in 2021 was largely driven by the comparison basis of 2020 when COVID restrictions were at their highest levels even though residential sales were down compared to 2020, they were still 2% above their pre-pandemic levels in 2019. In addition, residential customer accounts increased by 0.7% in 2021, which was the second strongest year for customer growth in over a decade. Customer growth was nearly twice as strong in the West, up 0.9% when compared to the East territory, which was up 0.5%. The last item to point out on the residential chart is that you'll notice that we added the projected 2022 growth to the right of the chart. We're projecting a modest decrease in residential sales in 2022, recognizing that there will not be likely another fiscal stimulus to boost the economy in 2022, like we had in the past 2 years. So moving over to the right, weather normalized commercial sales increased by 4.3% for both the quarter and the annual comparison. This made 2021 the strongest year for commercial sales in AEP history. 2021 included a strong bounce back in the sectors most impacted by the pandemic, such as schools, churches and hotels. But the strongest growth in commercial sales came from the growth in data centers, especially in Central Ohio. Looking forward, we expect a modest decline in commercial sales growth in 2022, recognizing the challenging conditions businesses are managing with inflation, the labor shortages and higher interest rates expected in 2022. So if we move to the lower left corner, you'll see that the industrial sales also posted a very strong quarter. Industrial sales for the quarter increased by 2.4%, bringing the annual growth up to 3.7%. Industrial sales were up at most operating companies in the quarter and mainly - in many of the largest sectors. Looking forward, we're projecting 5.7% growth in the industrial sales in 2022. This is mostly the result of the number of new large customer expansions that will be coming online as a result of our continued focus on economic development. Finally, when you pull it all together in the lower right corner, you'll see that AEP's normalized retail sales increased by 1.4% for the quarter and ended the year up 2.1% above 2020 levels. By all indications, the recovery from the pandemic has locked a year and our service territory is positioned to benefit from the future economic growth. Let's have a quick look at the company's capitalization and liquidity position beginning on Page 14. On a GAAP basis, our debt-to-capital ratio increased 0.1% from the prior quarter to 62.1%. When adjusted for the Storm Uri event, the ratio is slightly lower than it was at year-end 2020 and now stands at 61.4%. Let's talk about our FFO to debt metric. The impact of Storm Uri continues to have a temporary and noticeable impact on this metric. Taking a look at the upper right quadrant of this page, you'll see our FFO to debt metric based on the traditional Moody's and GAAP calculated basis as well as on an adjusted Moody's and GAAP calculated basis. On an unadjusted Moody's basis, our FFO to debt ratio decreased by 0.3% during the quarter to 9.9%. As you know, the rating agencies continue to take the anticipated recovery into consideration as it relates to our credit rating. On an adjusted basis, the Moody's FFO to debt metric is 13.3%. As mentioned in prior calls, this 13.3% figure removes or adjusts the calculation to eliminate the impact of approximately $1.2 billion of cash outflows associated with covering the unplanned Uri-driven fuel and purchase power costs in the SPP region directly impacting PSO and SWEPCO in particular. The metric is also adjusted to remove the effect of the associated debt we used to fund the unplanned payments. This should give you a sense of where we are or where we would be from a business as usual perspective. As Nick mentioned, we're now targeting an FFO to debt metric in the 14% to 15% range, which is commensurate with the Baa2, BBB flat stable rating. We expect to see this metric to begin to trend toward this new range of 14% to 15% in the latter half of 2022 as we make progress on the regulatory matters that are underway, including the recovery of Uri costs. As you know, we're in frequent contact with the rating agencies to keep them apprised of all aspects of our business and in the presentation today on Page 48, you'll see our financing plan. And aside from some modifications around the capital allocation and refinements on cash flows, everything remains intact as well as the general gist of the financing plan, including equity. Let's quickly visit our liquidity summary on the lower right side of this slide. Between our bank revolver capacity and cash balance, our liquidity position remains strong at $4 billion. And in the lower left, you can see our qualified pension funding continues to be strong, increasing 1.2% during the quarter to 104.8%. So let's go to slide 15. The initiatives that we talked about today set a strong foundation for 2022 and beyond, all of which I would submit to you include a commitment to a boost in our earnings power, credit position and high grading of our asset portfolio while derisking and simplifying our business profile. So to quickly recap of particular interest to our investor community, our equity investor community, we are lifting and tightening our long-term earnings growth rate to 6% to 7%. Consequently, we're increasing our 2022 earnings guidance range to $4.87 to $5.07 per share, up $0.02 from the original guidance. Of particular interest to our fixed income lender and credit rating agency community in addition to our equity investors, we're lifting and tightening our FFO to debt target range to 14% to 15%, which is consistent with a Baa2 stable and BBB flat stable rating. And of interest to all of our financial stakeholders, we are committed to the active management, high-grading and simplification of our asset portfolio to support our growth and transition to a clean energy future as a regulated utility holding company. The sale of our Kentucky operations is on track to close in the second quarter of this year and is reflected in our earnings guidance assumptions for 2022. And as we announced today, we've eliminated the growth capital in the contracted renewables area, moved that capital transmission and announced the sale process of all or a portion of the unregulated contract renewable portfolio with the goal of maximizing value. We've already begun to reflect a portion of this asset rotation in our 5-year $38 billion CapEx guidance as evidenced by the $1.5 billion increase in transmission investment and the $1.3 billion reduction in the unregulated generation and marketing segment. While the reallocation of capital is now assumed in the guidance range we have updated for you, the utilization of sales proceeds is not yet reflected in the multiyear financing plan. And therefore, what you can anticipate hearing or seeing from us is that we will operate within the increased earnings growth and credit metric financial targets we provided to you today, working within those targets, funds from the sale activities will be directed to our regulated business as we continue our efforts to enhance the transmission infrastructure and to effectuate our generation transformation. Additionally, depending on the timing of the sale of our unregulated contract renewables portfolio or any future asset optimization activities, we will have a bias toward reducing and/or avoiding future equity needs. As you would expect, we'll update our guidance details once we have announcements so we can share with you. We're confident in our ability to deliver on our new and improved promises to you, given our focus on disciplined capital allocation, solid execution and positive regulatory outcomes. We really appreciate your time today. I'm going to hand it back to the operator now so we can get your questions. Operator : Thank you.  Our first question, we'll go to the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. And your line is open. Steve Fleishman : Hey, good morning. Can you hear me okay, Nick? Nick Akins : Yes. I can hear you fine. Steve Fleishman : Okay. Great, thanks. Just on the renewables assets that you're selling, could you give us maybe a little info if you have it, maybe for 2021 actuals, even just the earnings or the EBITDA, cash flow of those - that business, those assets? Nick Akins : Yes. And it's around $0.15. Julie Sloat : Yes, Steve, this is Julie. I'll jump in here with some financial details, and I know Nick will jump in with some additional color. Let me talk about how we're thinking about this for 2022 because, as you know, 2021 was a bit of an anomaly with Storm Uri. So that kind of led to some different earnings streams that probably are not indicative of the asset base. So for 2022, what we're thinking is - and there's a little bit of wiggle room in here, talk about mid-teens in terms of sense, in terms of contribution to 2022 earnings. So if you want to kind of put a band around it, I don't know, $0.13 to $0.17 associated with those assets in particular, that gives you a little order of magnitude there. Steve Fleishman : That's helpful. And do you have a sense of kind of EBITDA? Julie Sloat : I don't have something to share with you today. And as you know, the renewable portfolio in terms of contracted assets is comprised of about, what, 1,600 megawatts of capacity, and that obviously varies from project to project. And as we said in our opening comments, we would be looking to monetize a portion or all of that over a period of time. So obviously, that will vary by asset and in projects specifically. So that's the only reason I'm being a little opaque on the EBITDA statistics. Nick Akins : And you'll see some sales occur probably in 2022 and then more in 2023. Steve Fleishman : Okay. Okay. That's helpful. And then the - can you just - one last financial question on that. Can you just remind me what the -- if there's any debt directly on those assets or not? Julie Sloat : Yes. Steve, again, this is Julie. There is a project specific debt, and there's a tax equity on obligation component to it as well. So as of 12/31/21, the debt component was around $252 million, tax equity about $123 million. So all in, you're talking about $375 million. Steve Fleishman : That's super helpful. Thanks. And then one other question, I'll leave it to others, please. Just the - curious just on the renewables, there's been a lot of cost inflation pressure on renewables. Obviously, there's inflation pressure on conventional as well, maybe even more. But just how are you feeling about kind of managing that within your RFPs and still showing that economically, this makes sense for your key states? Nick Akins : Yes. We actually feel good about it because with Traverse coming online, that's really the last major physical addition for this year. And then most of the renewables that are being applied for are in that '24 and '25 range. So you still have time for supply chain to pick up and certainly from a pricing perspective to be able to adjust. So we feel really good about our position because we're not in the middle of something where we're having to adjust. And then -- so that's - we're in a good position going forward. Steve Fleishman : Great. That\u2019s helpful. Congrats on the announcements. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. And your line is open. Shar Pourreza : Good morning, guys. Just one - Nick, you went kind of fast through the 1 point in the prepared remarks. But I guess, can you elaborate again, how you're thinking about additional asset optimization opportunities should the IRPs at the various states kind of work in your favor? I mean, I guess, strategics, privates infrastructure seem to continue to want to pay up for assets. which we're obviously again seeing this morning. Did I hear you right that the message is, is that as you're thinking about incremental capital opportunities to fund the renewables through the IRPs that issuing traditional equity as a last resort. Nick Akins : Yes. And actually, and I've said this, we're - we have two pinnacles of growth. We've got the transmission side, which we have plenty of capability relative to project flow to be able to check and adjust along the way. It's huge. And then, of course, on the renewable side of things, we have approximately in there about 50% estimate for ownership, which is sort of a view going into it. But I can say that because of after Storm Uri, after many of the effects in terms of utility ownership, we believe that ownership level is going to be higher than that. Matter of fact, in the Virginia side, it looks like 75% of it is owned and the other filings we're making is primarily 100% owned. So - and that really says to us that you're seeing a continual progression of really the standard view of portfolio management going forward. I think you're in the age of that and asset optimization to ensure that we're putting our capital in the right places. And that says there's a prioritization scheme as we go forward. Now I can't say today what that prioritization scheme looks like. But certainly, Kentucky was an example of that. First, it was the unregulated generation. Before that, it was the - I guess it was the barge line facilities. And you're seeing that step toward clarification, simplification and making sure that we are optimizing the capital in the right places. And today, we have, as I said earlier, the transmission in particular, we will not give up our position as being the largest transmission provider in this country by far. We have the bandwidth. We have the ability to move projects forward. And then on the renewable side, we're at the leading front edge of a major transformation that's going to benefit our ability to not only help in terms of customer rates because the renewables being brought in, but also to be able to deploy the capital necessary to make that happen. So you're going to see a continual process of moving forward with those kinds of activities. And the fact of the matter is, our renewables are now focused on capacity replacements, and so that's a natural progression of what occurs within the regulated framework. And for us, it puts us in great shape to make sure that these projects are actually needed. They actually produce benefits for consumers, and we have the backup capacity to provide for the demand periods. We're in a great position for this transformation. That's why we want to take advantage of it. So for those jurisdictions that meet those areas where transmission, the ability to participate in the clean energy transformation, those will be the high priority assets that we look at going forward. Shar Pourreza : Okay. Perfect. That's helpful. And then Nick, just lastly on the growth rate ticking up to 6 7%. On one hand, it's consistent with your past comments about being in the top half of the trajectory. But on the other hand, you are basically telling the market, you don't see any situations where you see growth at 5%, right, which is great. As we think about sort of your wind and solar opportunity set through '26, which hasn't really changed from prior disclosures. How do we think about these in the context of your updated growth trajectory? Could they be accretive or simply extend the runway? And then are you assuming any sort of win assumptions in that updated growth guidance? Thank you. Nick Akins : Yes. The way it sits right now, we look for sustainability when we make these adjustments associated with the growth rate, particularly the long-term growth rate. We would not have made this long-term growth rate if we didn't see a solid progression of the sustainability of the 6% to 7%. And actually, the project flow that you're seeing the - certainly, the reallocation of capital and actually - this is sort of an aside, but certainly, when we go from contracted renewables to the migration to a full suite of regulated renewables, it's -- we want to keep the talent that we have too, to make that transition and really focus on that effort. So I would say that the fundamentals are in place for continued optimization, solidification of 6% to 7%, validation of a midpoint that's higher than our previous midpoint and confirms to investors that we feel really good about the position that we're in. And as we go along, we'll see what happens, but we always look at -- when we make guidance changes and long-term growth changes, we look at the sustainability of that for years to come because consistency and quality of earnings and dividend are paramount to us. Shar Pourreza : Terrific. Congrats, guys. Thank you very much. Nick Akins : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet JPMorgan. Your line is open. Jeremy Tonet : Hi, good morning. Nick Akins : Morning, Jeremy. Jeremy Tonet : Just wanted to bring a finer point to the equity question, if I could. It seems like the asset sale timing could be kind of in pieces here. I'm just wondering, does this line up where really kind of completely removes equity from the plan at this point? Just trying to get a finer point on what equity needs could look like post a successful sale here? Nick Akins : Yes. I think it would be great if we could map it exactly to what the equity needs are in the future. But I can say that certainly, this is a big part of our ability to manage the portfolio so that we obviate the need for new equity, but you still have ATMs, you still have the convertibles that are coming on during that period of time. But at this point, we sit really good. I don't know if you want to go... Julie Sloat : Yes. So Jeremy, you're right on. In an ideal situation, we would like to pick the landing on every equity issuance and be able to kind of sidestep that and have a really strong balance sheet in conjunction with that. We'll see how ultimately the timing goes, as I mentioned in my opening comments, there will be a bias toward trying to alleviate that pressure that you might otherwise perceive around equity issuances. But as you know, if you look at our financing plan, there's not a lot out there, $100 million of DRIP in 2023. And as Nick mentioned, we've got the convertibles that convert this year and next year. So we're in good shape. But to the extent that we can maximize value of asset sales and time those, yes, that would be definitely something we'd be interested in doing. But again, the idea is to hit on all of those objectives. 6% to 7% earnings growth hit nicely and comfortably in the guidance range that we give to you for 2022. And make sure that we're right alongside with the solid balance sheet metrics of 14% to 15% for that FFO to debt statistic. So we'll thread the needle. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. That's very helpful there. And I just want to come back to bending the curve if you could on O&M. And just updated thoughts there on, I guess, how you see that progressing in this kind of inflationary environment? Any incremental thoughts you could share there? Nick Akins : Yes. So - and obviously, we're taking a good hard look at that. Our achieving excellence program has been in place for a couple 3 years now. And it's really showing the value of our organization completely going through. And actually, it should be known, one of the silver linings of COVID if there is a silver lining of COVID is that made us think about what was truly needed for the company going forward, particularly when you made all these adjustments to compensate for what we thought would be a really negative approach to the economy during that period. So we're going to take those learnings and continue to focus on bending the O&M curve. And of course, that becomes even more of a challenge given labor rates, given certainly if there is supply chain-related activities on the long term. But we feel really confident in our ability to continue to bend that curve or at least hold it flat, but we'll certainly continue to focus on that. And that's a huge part of what we're doing because all these pieces sort of fit together where every dollar of O&M we're able to put $7 of capital in place with the reduction. So we have the focus on reducing the O&M as much as possible, and it's advantageous to us because we have a huge pipeline of additional capital opportunities that we could take advantage of for the betterment of customer service and so forth. And it's all sort of ties together. The load forecast has clearly been positive recently, and it looks like it's going to continue to be positive. That's good for cash flow and good for our ability to invest. And then certainly, all those things sort of fit together, but we'll continue to focus in on all of those activities going forward. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. That\u2019s very helpful. Leave it there, thanks. Nick Akins : Yeah. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Your line is open. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, good morning, team. Thanks for the time. If I could follow up a little bit on the last couple of questions here. Just to the extent which that you're successful in, shall we say, fully offsetting equity here, where does that put you again? I know you're taking the moment now to raise your guidance ranges. But how do you think about being within that range to the context that you removed this equity as well? It would seem like this is a likely fairly accretive move to divest renewables given where the transaction multiples have been. Nick Akins : Yes. Obviously, we're going to have to get in that process and understand what the actual benefits are. And of course, you're dealing with PTCs, ITCs, the value of those, the timing of those kinds of activities as well. And so we're going to have to sort of fill our way through that part of it. But certainly, the stage is set. And -- there's some -- and we're looking at somewhat of a phased approach, which that not only matches the equity needs, but also matches the business valuation itself. And I think that that's going to be a clear issue for us to focus on as we go forward. But Julie, anything you want to add? Julie Sloat : No, I think you're hitting on it. I mean the other thing that we'll make sure that we're sensitive to Julien is obviously, customer rate is always sensitive to that. But to Nick's point, this allows us to set the runway, again, gives us confidence in the boost to the growth rate of 6% to 7% for the obvious reasons. And then the objective is to, again, maintain the balance sheet, continue to derisk and simplify the business portfolio and make sure that we're hitting comfortably in the guidance range that we give to you as we give that to you sequentially. Every year, we come out with a new guidance range for the upcoming year, and we'll continue to fine-tune that. Nick Akins : The ability that we have to accelerate and deaccelerate is of tremendous value. And certainly from the contracted renewables process that we go through, that's going to be a benefit. Our ability to accelerate and deaccelerate, whether it's transmission, whether it's renewables, those are clear options that we have available to us that we didn't have before. And when you think about the progress that we're going to make and the ability to focus on even continuing to advance the capital needs. That's something that all these things are going to have to come together, but I can tell you that the foundation and the clear optimism around that continues to benefit us. And it will be a process, and that's why I mentioned the Analyst Day. I think it's going to be important in the Analyst Day for us to not only obviously celebrate the sale of Kentucky, but also to focus in on what the transactions are going to look like, what the structure of these deals are going to look like, the timing and be able to also talk about what capital looks like in the future based on what we're seeing relative to load and everything else. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: And if I can, just one more quick one. I mean, why now is maybe the question, right? I mean I appreciate the guidance rates altogether, but just curious on the timing. Obviously, you all make sort of an annual update of EEI, you talked about in Analyst Day, prospectively. Just curious on what gave you the confidence now. I mean appreciative of the asset sale. Nick Akins : No, thanks for the question because at November EEI, there was a lot still outstanding. We had 10 cases going on out there. I know we got a lot of questions about, okay, why has it taken so long in Ohio? Is your relationship? What's it like in Ohio? And it was like 2 weeks after that, that we got both cases done and they were clean orders. And our relationship is great with the regulators in Ohio and with legislature. So it was -- and then you had all the other cases that were still outstanding that came through I&M on Rockport. Certainly, there was a PSO base case that was done right at the end of the year. So you had all these things going on. But the other thing too is Kentucky transaction is still ongoing. And the process -- and it's -- like I said, it started with unregulated generation and certainly everything we knew before and that we need to solidify the consistency of our earnings going forward. Well, Kentucky was the first of the primary business units that we really took a look at. And now that, that process is ongoing, okay, what's the next step in our evolution? And when you think about those 2 pinnacles of growth, everything that we're going to be doing supports that ability to move that forward. We know -- and it wasn't lost on us that during November EEI when we reduced the transmission investment, there was an unintended message that, that somehow the transmission pipeline was ending or there were challenges associated with projects, and that was not the case. I mean we said that then, and we continue to fortify that measure. I think it was important for us to come out at this earnings call and set the record straight on what the firmness of the foundation of this company and its ability to move forward in a very, very positive way. And I just -- I wasn't going to let November EEI stand. Julie Sloat : I can jump in another statistic that might be helpful to Julien as well. So when we look back at 2021, the rate relief we had assumed in guidance was something like $230 million as we got and then closed in on the end of the year, we had already secured something like 112% of that. So we were over what we had anticipated. So that gave us some momentum. And looking at 2022, so there's an updated 2022 waterfall for guidance in the presentation today that's got the actualization for 2021 and then some refinements for 2022 in conjunction with the growth rate uplift. But we're assuming about $381 million of rate relief. And this is before the Indiana settlement that was approved yesterday. We had already secured 55% of that. So we're north of 55%. I need to go back and do the math to boost that number up to accommodate the order that we got for Indiana. But again, validating and giving us confidence that now is the time to do this obviously, came in with a strong year in 2021, giving us the momentum and assurance around those regulatory recoveries that we had anticipated and a little bit more. So that's to give you a little bit of statistics to match what Nick just shared with you. Nick Akins : Yes. And as I said at the beginning of the call, this process is not over. I mean we are continuing the process of really fine-tuning the optimization around all of our assets. And certainly, from a resource perspective to be able to take the contracted renewables and the talent that's there and be able to migrate that over to a massive build-out associated with regulated renewables is a great opportunity for us and certainly everyone involved with it because this process is going to continue. And certainly, we want to register that we will and have been a participant in that process. But the why now question is important. I mean the why now question is that we're at the precipice and I sort of presage this, I guess it was third quarter last year, but we're at the precipice of substantial movement toward a clean energy economy. You can do it with the transformation of renewables, you can do it with -- certainly with other types of technologies that are developing, but it also requires transmission. And certainly, just the refurbishment of transmission and distribution, by the way, we have a huge pipeline relative to distribution, too, that's been identified. That's really -- all of those are opportunities for us to focus in on what's truly important to our customers, but also to our shareholders. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Durgesh Chopra : Just Julie, quickly to follow-up on the economics of the potential renewable sale. Should we be expecting a tax leakage there? Or you have enough NOLs and other tax to offset that? Julie Sloat : Yes. Yes. We would expect a little tax leakage there. But as you know, we're not entirely efficient with our tax credits. So we've got a little bit of wiggle room because we've got some tax credits sitting on the bench. So I wouldn't necessarily look to that being as a stumbling block or a material gating item for us. So we'll be able to manage through that. Durgesh Chopra : Okay. And just one, all the other questions were asked and answered. Just one, Nick, what's the confidence level in getting sort of the Kentucky sale done in Q2? We sort of saw the headlines of you sort of kind of withdrawing the petition from on the plants. So maybe just talk to that, what drove that decision of withdrawing that petition and the confidence level of closing that transaction in Q2. Nick Akins : Yes, sure thing. Well, obviously, the state of Kentucky was concerned about the FERC case and the timing of it and how it would impact their schedule. So certainly, we recognize that and wanted to accommodate the Kentucky Commission. So we pulled down the FERC filing, and we'll certainly refile the FERC filing after Kentucky does their review. And of course, with the state approvals at that particular time, we may get a quicker response from FERC. So -- and that's -- I think they have 60 days, but it could happen earlier than that. But still, that keeps us in the second quarter. It'd be May to June time frame, but still in the second quarter. So that's not an issue for us. And I know that -- there's certainly a lot of dialogue will occur. It already has relative to Mitchell and how it works and then also in terms of what interveners may think about the transaction, but that's a typical -- any time you get into a sale of in a transaction. That kind of thing will occur and there'll be discussions and we'll get it all resolved. So we're still very confident that we're going to get that done because actually, the new owner has made commitments of jobs and those types of activities within the state of Kentucky. And I think it's really important for anyone looking at this transaction to recognize that you're putting this utility in the hands of a reputable operator. They'll do a good job managing the investments, but also a good job in the communities, and they're very focused on that. So really, the -- this process should be a forward-looking process, not a past process -- past-looking process. So I really think that that's going to carry the day. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Weisel with Scotiabank. Your line is open. Andrew Weisel : First question. Forgive me if I missed it, but the new 6% to 7% growth range, is that anchored off the midpoint of the new 2022 guidance? And am I right that 2022 guidance includes contributions from contracted renewables, but not from Kentucky? Julie Sloat : That's -- you've got that exactly right on all fronts, right on. Nick Akins : Yes. It is 2022, new rebases. Andrew Weisel : Okay. Would there be a rebase assuming the contracted renewables business does get sold? In other words, would -- if I take 6.5% off the new 2022 midpoint, would I need to lower that after an asset sale? Nick Akins : I think you should look at the contracted renewables is supporting the 6% to 7% with the base of '22. Julie Sloat : To add a finer point to that as well. To get right to the heart of your question, we do not expect to rebase our earnings when we take action on selling these assets in particular. And as we mentioned, it will take a little bit of an accordion feature to it in the sense that over time, these transactions will occur so we've got some flexibility there. And then with the redeployment of the cash coming in the door back to regulated utilities, so whether it's transmission or a combination of transmission and regulated renewables we feel confident that we'll be able to maintain the guidance ranges and continue along the trajectory. Andrew Weisel : Okay. Great. And that makes sense given you said it was about $0.15 of EPS versus $5 or so for the business overall. And then lastly, just to confirm, can you comment on dividends, given the change to the EPS growth outlook and the potential asset sales? How should we think about the dividend growth outlook from here? Nick Akins : Yes. No change there. Dividends will be commensurate with the earnings growth. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Nick Campanella with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Nick Campanella : Just looking at the 14% to 15% of total debt on the funding slides. Just curious what the feedback then from the agencies and the potential to sell some of the nonregulated stuff and the fact that your business mix is increasing to more regulated earnings. Do you expect any change in your minimum thresholds here? Julie Sloat : Actually, we are having conversations. And as I mentioned earlier, we keep them apprised of all aspects of our business. So from a credit risk profile perspective, this should be viewed as a favorable step, again, as a commitment and continued twist towards traditional regulated portfolio of assets. So I can't speak for them as it relates to what those thresholds would be, but 14% to 15% is most definitely within the wicket as it relates to a solid and strong balance sheet, I would submit to you again, BAA2 stable, BBB flat, stable. That's where we expect to be with that 14% to 15%. And please do reach out to the credit rating agencies to make sure that they're armed with everything we know so that they can take care of you all. Nick Campanella : Absolutely, absolutely. Yes. And then just regarding the sales forecast and your comments regarding economic growth. For this year, it seems like industrial is really driving overall consolidated weather normalized growth higher. Can you just kind of speak to what's baked into the long-term forecast here? And if we remain in a higher commodity price environment into '23, '24, how could that change things for AEP? Nick Akins : We -- any long-term forecast, we tend to temper. We're actually getting in the process of a new forecast. But right now, we've estimated about 1% increase. And I think you'll see that this -- what was overall 1.5 or something like that. Julie Sloat : 1.6%. Nick Akins : Yes, 1.6%. So we're going into the year, assuming 1%. And with the investments being made by these large customers, industrial is always a leading edge relative to commercial and residential. So -- and then also when you look at the numbers, 1 year over another, it isn't quite apples and apples because of COVID and the impacts there. So you'll see a reduction in the residential. But if you look at pre COVID, it's more, it's higher because the stay-at-home environment has continued, work-from-home environment has continued. So we get the benefits of a more robust residential and at the same time, industrial picking up. And in fact, when you look at our service territory in relation to what's going on internationally, we do have strong energy growth and energy-related activities in our territories and manufacturing activities. And with onshoring around security, the point I was making earlier, we're going to wind up working pretty well from a growth perspective from a load standpoint. Julie Sloat : To give you a little more color if this is helpful. I'm on Page 13 of the slide presentation today, and I'm looking at the industrial quadrant in the lower left side of that slide. As you point out, we are looking at a 5% -- 5.7% uplift in that particular weather normalized load. And it's really driven by previous economic development activities. As Nick pointed out today, those economic development opportunities really set the foundation for the future. So we're reaping the benefits of stuff that we've done in the past as you look at that forecast and that covers many sectors, metals, chemicals, paper, oil and gas, but about 99% of the load expansion in 2022 comes from our T&D segment in Texas and Ohio. Just to give you a little bit more color. And then that obviously drives you over to the right side of the slide, looking at 2022 estimated across the entire Board a 1.6% lift is what we're assuming. And then as Nick mentioned, beyond to the extent that we can push it to 1% on an ongoing basis, that would be fantastic, and that would be our hope and expectation. Operator : We will go to the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Your line is open. Paul Patterson : Great -- great presentation. I'm sorry if I missed this, but is the -- I assume that there's probably going to be gains on the sale of renewables. Are those gains going to be part of the 6% to 7% growth? Julie Sloat : I guess let me ask or answer it this way. So we will have gains on the sales. And typically, when we have gains on sales of assets, capture those and the reconciliation gap to operating earnings, so we would kind of offset those. But asked another way or another question we got earlier, Paul, I don't know if you asked or heard this, but we were asked, would we be in a taxable gain situation. So I'll answer that question too. The answer would be yes. But we do have tax credits sitting on the bench that we'd be able to utilize against that. So what we don't want folks to do is worry about that being a real material gating item, we'd be able to manage through that. Paul Patterson : Yes, I heard that, I guess. So just to clarify, it's not going to be part of operating earnings or adjusted earnings going forward? Julie Sloat : Correct. That's correct. Yes. That will get captured in the reconciliation. Yes. you got it, not in operating earnings. Paul Patterson : Okay, great. And then just the -- and I apologize if I missed this, but the average length of the contracts that are on these assets? Are there different vintages and stuff? I'm just wondering where that sort of stands? Julie Sloat : Yes. average PPA length is around 11 years. Paul Patterson : Okay, right now. Okay. And then just finally, on the Kentucky Power, you guys talked about the Mitchell plant sale, but the Kentucky PSC, as you know, on Tuesday, filed a protest not at FERC, not on the transaction itself, but on the application for the transaction, saying they felt that they need more information. And I was just sort of -- I was wondering if you could provide a little clarity. I mean they have their own proceeding, as you guys know, and they have -- and there's obviously this proceeding. I'm talking about the M&A via the transaction proceeding at FERC. And I'm just sort of wondering why they are -- or if you can give any insight as to why -- as to this protest that they filed saying, hey, the application is deficient. We're concerned about rates and we want more information. And sort of what -- how that might unfold or how we should think about that in the context of the proceeding? Nick Akins : Yes. Well, certainly, there's going to be all kinds of activity around getting the transaction through. And Kentucky, as I said earlier, I mean Kentucky is thoughtfully going through the areas that it wants to take a look at relative to the transaction. And certainly, that's something that we're going to make sure it happens in the process. And as I mentioned earlier on the FERC thing, we'll file FERC as soon as Kentucky gets through that. But at this point, though, there's nothing certainly, nothing that we can address. Do you have anything you want to add to that? Julie Sloat : No. that was fine. Paul Patterson : Well, I guess what I'm sort of asking is, is that I'm talking about specifically the Tuesday filing, not the Mitchell plant sales. So I mean, in other words, they were saying, hey, they want more information. It just seems to me that being a regulator that's going to be reviewing the actual transaction, it seems at least to me to be somewhat -- I was a little bit confused by the fact that they're saying to FERC hey, with respect to the transaction proceeding that docket, the EC dock is saying, hey, hold off, provide us more please. Please get them to give us more information when I would think that given that you guys filed this months ago, that information, they could be asking you within the context of the Kentucky review. Do you follow what I'm saying. I don't want to go into great, (inaudible) if you follow me, but that's what sort of seems to me to be a little bit strange about the FERC, the FERC request from Tuesday or we're not requesting the protest. Nick Akins : Yes. So -- well, you had the intervenors that came in. And -- and they're really trying to adjudicate issues that were already resolved by the Kentucky Commission. And so we'll go through that process of discussions with them. As far as Kentucky is concerned, obviously, they're looking to try to hold customers harmless during the transaction and really, as we look at this transaction, they're in good shape going forward. So I think, obviously, we'll have those discussions as we go along. Operator : And with that, I'd like to turn it back over to the speakers for any closing comments. Darcy Reese : Thank you for joining us on today's call. As always, the IR team will be available to answer any additional questions you may have.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Nick Akins : \u2026fourth quarter, we are maintaining that momentum and delivering strong results for the first quarter of 2022 with operating earnings for the first quarter coming in at $1.22 per share or $616 million. Earlier this year, we made a number of refinements to our strategic initiatives and financial targets. We raised our 2022 operating earnings guidance range and increased our long-term earnings growth rate and we have hit the ground running in 2022. Today we are reaffirming our 2022 full-year operating earnings guidance. As a reminder, we are guiding to a range of $4.87 to $5.07 per share for 2022 with a $4.97 midpoint and we also reaffirm our long-term earnings growth rate of 6% to 7%. As you'll recall, we announced several significant developments in connection with last quarter's earnings. In addition to lifting our 14% to 15% FFO to total debt targeted range, we announced on the decision to sell all or a portion of contracted renewable assets within the unregulated business. The announcement of this strategic divestiture allowed us to recalibrate our five-year capital plan of $38 billion with a $1.5 billion shift to transmission and the elimination of growth capital in the contracted renewables business. We are already seeing the positive impacts of these initiatives in quarter one, and we look forward to continue to execute in these important areas throughout the course of the year. We also expect to maintain positive momentum in our economic outlook as we work collaboratively with states to drive economic expansion in our service territory. There is more to come on all that, but I first want to take a step back and highlight some of the other proactive work our team has done. As macro trends continue to affect our industry in the economic landscape at large, we are focused on de-risking our platform and elevating our strategy to enhance shareholder value. For example, given lingering global supply chain issues, we are diversifying our mix of suppliers in order to reduce the impact on our capital investment plan. As a result, AEP has experienced minimal customer or business disruptions to-date. With these significant initiatives underway and a track record of thinking creatively, it is truly a team effort and we are lucky to have one of the most talented teams in the business. Regarding Kentucky, we expect to complete the sale of Kentucky Power and AEP Kentucky TransCo to Liberty in the second quarter of this year. A regulatory timeline of the sale is on Slide 7 of today's presentation. In 2021, we announced a comprehensive strategic review of our Kentucky operations resulting in an agreement to sell those assets for $2.846 billion enterprise value. Both parties have been steadily working to obtain the necessary approvals to complete this transaction, which is in the public interest. The Kentucky Public Service Commission hearing was held on March 28th and March 29th. We know that Liberty is well positioned to serve Kentucky customers and are confident our employees in Kentucky will continue to thrive within an organization that prioritizes safety and operational excellence. Based on the statutory requirements, we continue to expect to receive a decision from the commission on the sale transfer no later than May 4th. FERC approval on the sale transfer is also in process. Earlier this week, FERC notified us of a need for more information in the 203 transfer application. This request is not unusual as FERC looks to ensure its record is complete by seeking additional information. We do not believe this request will impact the closing of the deal in the second quarter. Once a decision is made by the state level next week, we will provide the requested information back to FERC, we'll plan to ask FERC to abide by the original approval timeline to ensure Kentucky customers receive benefits from this transaction in a timely manner. Another significant regulatory milestone for the transaction is gaining approvals on the Mitchell operating agreement, which were the condition of the final sale transfer. Both Kentucky and West Virginia are aware that updated Mitchell operating agreement approvals are needed to put in place the commission orders on environmental compliance issued 2021. The Kentucky Public Service Commission hearings were held on March 1st and March 30th and the West Virginia Public Service Commission was held on April 7th. Parties providing options allowing flexibility for both states to collaborate and reach a common agreement as Kentucky continues to wind down interest in Mitchell plant post 2028. We expect to receive commission decisions on the Mitchell agreements on an expedited basis in May of this year. We plan to file the related FERC application after State Commission approvals. Throughout this process, we have established a strong record of benefits of this transaction. Most notably, the clear and measurable customer benefits that we see. Okay. Now, moving onto the contracted renewable asset sale. During our fourth quarter earnings call in February, we announced the decision to sell all or a portion of our unregulated contracted renewables portfolio to simplify and de-risk the company and allow us to focus on our regulated business. Our portfolio consists of 1,600 megawatts of unregulated contracted renewables, the sale of which will help facilitate the investment of 16,000 megawatts of regulated renewables through 2030. In the last couple of months, we have made significant progress on this opportunity, including working with an advisor preparing outside consultant reviews of the technical and market aspects of our portfolio and evaluating our sales strategy and timing. Interest in the sale of the portfolio has been robust. The sale provides a unique opportunity to acquire large operating wind portfolio complemented with some solar operations as well. We expect to launch the sales process sometime during the second half of 2022, likely in the August-September timeframe and can be accelerated or deaccelerated as needed. Additionally, we are pleased to announce that we assigned a term sheet to sell most of our wind and solar development portfolio including five sites which are located in the Southwest Power Pool. We have also executed an agreement to sell a solar development site here in Ohio. Financial details of these upcoming sales are confidential and will not be disclosed, but demonstrate our commitment toward that execution. The reallocation of contracted renewables capital is assumed in our guidance, but utilization of proceeds is not yet reflected in guidance or our multi-year financing plan. We will seek to maximize transaction proceeds in the sale, avoid dilution and direct the proceeds to investments in our regulated business as we continue to enhance the transmission infrastructure and move forward with our generation fleet transformation. Looking ahead, we will continue our track record of optimizing the portfolio and reallocating capital to our regulated business where we continue to see a meaningful long-term opportunity for growth. AEP is making significant progress as well in our transition to a clean energy future. In fact, we already have several initiatives underway in line with our sustainability goals and through our regulated renewables execution. Details can be seen on Slides 8 and 9. In March we commissioned our third and final North Central Wind site Traverse Wind Energy Center, which is the largest single wind farm built at one time in North America and one of the largest wind facilities worldwide completing the $2 billion trifecta investment that includes Sundance and the Maverick Wind Energy centers. Combined, they are providing 14,084 megawatts of clean energy to our customers in Arkansas, Louisiana, and Oklahoma. North Central will save customers in an estimated $3 billion in electricity costs over the next 30 years. In March, we also issued a request for proposal at I&M for 800 megawatts of wind and 500 megawatts of solar. Additional RFPs are in process simultaneously at APCo, PSO and SWEPCO with expected in-service dates of 2024 to 2025. We expect to make a regulatory filing in the second quarter of this year related to the SWEPCO's June 2021 RFP. These are long-term investments, not just for our business in our local communities, but for the global environment as well. Through our current state of coal retirements, we are progressing towards our target of an 80% carbon emissions reduction rate by 2030 and net zero by 2050. Achieving this goal is an integral part of our long-term strategy to prioritize regulated investment opportunities and transition our generation portfolio. Our plans are a very well thought out, continue the movement to a clean energy economy, but remain firmly grounded in the principles of resiliency, reliability and affordability while recognizing the value of diverse portfolio of resources, particularly given today's world of energy related volatility. Last year we set regulatory foundations in a series of rate cases across multiple jurisdictions. Regulated ROE as of March 31st, 2022, is it a steady 9.2% as we continue to work through regulatory cases and focus on reducing authorized versus actual ROE spreads. I&M obtained Commission approval in February on our Indiana base case settlement. Ohio oral arguments of APCo's 2020 Virginia base case appeal were held in March at the Virginia Supreme Court with anticipated final decision this year. We expect to see Commission decisions as well on SWEPCO's rate cases this year in both Arkansas and Louisiana and look forward to keeping you informed on that progress too. Related to FERC, we command the commission for moving forward with proposed reforms to transmission planning and cost allocation. First proposed rulemaking aligns with our goals of developing a more robust reliable and flexible grid of the future that ultimately reduces cost to customers and strengthens economic development in the communities in which we serve. We believe many of these reforms are needed to build the infrastructure necessary to transition our generation fleet in the most efficient and cost-effective way possible and achieve our carbon reduction goals. We look forward to continuing to work collaboratively with the commission on this, and any subsequent rule makings and with the RTOs on implementing any new requirements. At the conclusion of our fourth quarter call, I told you all that AEP stood poised to make even greater headway in 2022 and I think it's fair to say we are making good on that promise. Capitalizing on our momentum from 2021, we have continued to execute against our strategic objective steadily and successfully. As we think about what's next for this year and beyond, we hope to further modernize our energy grid in order to supply a reliable cleaner low cost resources for all the communities we serve. We will also consider further asset rotation through the lens of de-risking and simplification and we'll evaluate any and all value additive potential activities as we focus on our regulated business. As I've said before, AEP is in a very unique position, the largest transmission system, one of the largest renewables build outs and the diverse territory to adjust from the risk of supply chain, load forecast, regulatory risks et cetera, AEP is the very definition of consistency and opportunity. We at AEP, as well as our shareholders and customers hold ourselves accountable on the continual execution of all of these strategic objectives. To paraphrase a big hit by the police, every breath you take, every move you make, every step you take, we'll be watching AEP, and as our CFO would say, we've got this, Julie? Julie Sloat : Thank you Nick, thanks Darcy. It's good to be with you this morning. Thanks for dialing in everyone. I'm going to walk us through our first quarter results, share some updates on our service territory load and finish with commentary on our credit metrics, liquidity, as well as some thoughts on our guidance, financial targets and recap our current portfolio management activities underway. So let's go to Slide 10, which shows the comparison of GAAP to operating earnings for the quarter. GAAP earnings for the first quarter were $1.41 per share compared to $1.16 per share in 2021. There is a reconciliation of GAAP to operating earnings on Page 16 of the presentation today. Let's walk through our quarterly operating earnings performance by segment on Slide 11. Operating earnings for the first quarter totaled $1.22 per share or $616 million compared to $1.15 per share or $571 million in 2021. Operating earnings for the Vertically Integrated Utilities were $0.59 per share, up $0.05, favorable drivers included rate changes across multiple jurisdictions, normalized load and O&M. These were somewhat offset by increased depreciation, lower off-system sales and wholesale load. I'd like to take a second to talk about O&M and depreciation in particular because of a change in accounting related to Rockport Unit II lease at I&M, we'll see approximately a $0.05 contribution of favorable O&M consequence offset by $0.05 of unfavorable depreciation in each quarter of 2022, but no consequential earnings impact. And to be clear, this is entirely consistent with the 2022 guidance details we posted in our investor presentations earlier this year. I have more to share on load and load performance here in a minute, so hang with me on this. The Transmission and Distribution Utilities segment earned $0.30 per share, up $0.07 compared to last year, favorable drivers in this segment included rate changes in Texas and Ohio, normalized load and transmission revenue. Offsetting these favorable items were unfavorable O&M and depreciation. The AEP Transmission Holdco segment contributed $0.34 per share, down a $0.01compared to last year. Investment growth was favorable by $0.03, offset by $0.02 of mainly property taxes, driven by the increased investment and a penny of income taxes. This is in line with the guidance that we provided to you earlier this year. You'll recall that our 2022 guidance had this segment down by $0.08 year-over-year as a result of the $0.12 of investment growth being more than offset by the annual true up that will occur in the second quarter and some unfavorable comparisons on the tax and financing side. As you know, this segment continues to be an important part of our 6% to 7% EPS growth. Generation and marketing produced $0.03 per share, down $0.03 from last year. The improvement in wholesale margins was more than offset by lower retail margins and reduced generation. You may recall that storm Yuri had an unfavorable impact on wholesale margins in the first quarter 2021. Finally, Corporate and Other was down a $0.01 per share, driven by increased O&M, lower investment gains and unfavorable interest. These were offset by favorable income taxes, the lower investment gains are largely related to charge point gains that we had in the first quarter of 2021. Turning to Slide 12, I'll provide an update on our normalized load performance for the quarter. In a general sense the AEP service territory is extremely fertile for economic growth right now, in fact as of the first quarter, our load has officially fully recovered from the pandemic recession and has now transitioned into the expansionary phase of this business cycle. Starting in the upper left corner, normalized residential sales increased by eight tenths of a percent, compared to the first quarter 2021. This growth was composed of growth in both customer counts and weather normalized usage for the quarter. While results were mixed by operating company, the strongest residential growth was at the AEP - was in the AEP service - AEP Texas service territory, which was partially influenced by the year-over-year comparison, given the customer outages driven by storm Yuri in the first quarter of 2021. A final data point to share regarding residential sales is that our first quarter sales were still 1.1% above their pre-pandemic levels, over two years after the pandemic began. This is driven by number of factors including higher numbers of people who are able to work remotely that used to work in offices prior to the pandemic. Moving to the right, weather normalized commercial sales increased by 4.2% compared to the first quarter of 2021, while growth in commercial sales is spread across every operating company and most industries, the largest increase in commercial sales is coming from data centers whose load was up 33% compared to last year. In addition, we continue to see strong recovery in the sectors most impacted by the pandemic such as hotels, schools, and churches, while real-estate has been booming throughout the entire pandemic. AEP normalize - AEP's normalized commercial sales in the first quarter were 2.5% above their pre-pandemic levels which shows that we've gone beyond recovery and are now in full expansion mode across the territory. If I can now focus your attention on the lower left corner, you'll see that industrial sales posted another very strong quarter up 5.6% compared to last year, industrial sales were up, at most operating companies and many of our largest sectors in the first quarter. We experienced double-digit growth in a number of key industries this quarter, including chemicals, manufacturing, oil and gas extraction, petroleum and petroleum products, we also saw robust growth in primary metals manufacturing, coal mining and food manufacturing. Having said that, first quarter industrial sales are still 1.6% behind their pre-pandemic levels. However, we have a large number of customer expansions that are expected to come online later this year and still fully expect to eclipse our pre-COVID industrial sales levels in 2022. We can continue to be confident in our full-year 2022 guidance for normalized retail load. While we certainly did not anticipate the Russian invasion in Ukraine when we developed the 2022 forecast. I'd like to remind you that AEP's service territory is uniquely positioned to benefit from higher energy prices, given the concentration of energy production that is located throughout the AEP footprint. Energy producers in our footprint have responded to higher energy prices, which has resulted in increased economic activity throughout this service territory. Finally, when you pull it all together in the lower-right corner, you'll see that AEP's normalized retail sales increased by 3.2% for the quarter. As I mentioned earlier, our load has gone beyond recovery mode and is in full expansion mode. For the quarter, every operating company posted higher normalized sales than last year. Furthermore, our first quarter retail sales were up, were 1.5% above their pre-pandemic levels. So 50 basis points above pre-pandemic levels. To use a sports analogy, I would say our load performance in the first quarter was in the zone. While there are many factors outside of our control that could influence our results, I want to stress that the positive load story we shared with you today is largely the result of intentional efforts by our employees to promote economic development as a part of our long-term strategy to strengthen the communities that we serve. We're fully aware of the increased uncertainty that exists in the macro economy, but if put into work that it takes to ensure that we continue to see growth in our service territory going forward. So let's go to Page 13 to check on the company's capitalization and liquidity position. On a GAAP basis, our debt to cap ratio increased 60 basis points from the prior quarter to 61.5%, primarily due to an increase in equity from our issuance of AEP common stock in March, which is consistent with our 2022 guidance as the $805 million - or the $805 million of equity units we issued three years ago converted to equity. Let's talk about our FFO to debt metric. Taking a look at the upper right quadrant on this page, you'll see our FFO to debt metric stands at 13.7% on both the Moody's and a GAAP basis, which is an increase of 3.8% and 3 9% respectively from the prior quarter. The metrics are calculated off of the 12 month rolling FFO total, so the increase in FFO to debt is mainly a result of the fact that the cash flow drag from February 2021 winter storm Yuri has now dropped off the cash flow from operations calculations. This improvement has significantly narrowed the gap toward achieving our FFO to debt target range of 14% to 15% . As we stated on the last earnings call, we anticipate trending toward this target range as the year progresses. Let's take a quick moment to visit our liquidity summary on the lower right side of Slide 13. Our five-year $4 billion bank revolver and two-year $1 billion revolving credit facility support our liquidity position, which remained strong at $3.8 billion. Switching gears, our qualified pension funding increased 1.6% during the quarter 106.4%. The rise in interest rates, the decreased plan liabilities was the primary driver for this quarter's gain and funded status. Let's go to Slide 14. This quarter has provided a solid foundation for the rest of 2022 and we're reaffirming our operating earnings guidance range of $4.87 per share to $5.07 per share. We continue to be committed to our long-term growth rate of 6% to 7% that we updated on our last earnings call. We're working through the Kentucky Power sale to Liberty and expect to close in the second quarter. And as Nick mentioned, we've signed an agreement to sell a solar development site in Ohio and have entered into a term sheet to sell five additional wind and solar sites in SPP on the unregulated side of the business. Additionally, we're preparing to market the unregulated contracted renewables portfolio in the second half of this year and are receiving a significant amount of interest on this. Beyond the portfolio optimization activities underway, we remain focused on the fundamentals, which are executing on the regulated renewables plan, disciplined capital allocation, and securing positive regulatory outcomes. Before we break, I want to mention one last thing before we get to your questions. And that's to remind everyone that while we have not yet set the date, we will be hosting an Investor conference sometime in late September, early fall timeframe to give you a broader AEP update. We truly do appreciate your time and attention today. With that I'm going to ask the operator to open the call, so we can hear what's on your mind and answer the questions that you have. Operator :  Our first question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith at Bank of America. Please go ahead. Julien Dumoulin-Smith:  Maybe let's start with this, just in terms of the timing of the renewable sale here. Can you talk a little bit about how the AD/CVD steps could impact that, I mean is that  on just your sense of the ability to get it done? Just any comments on that, and or implications again I assume that was separately related, how do you think about the timing of proceeds here, admittedly this is a little bit faster than what we had perceived, just talk about the proceeds from Liberty and this coming in perhaps little bit faster than perhaps the equity issuances in your forward plan what you would suggest? Nick Akins : Yes Julien, so most of our assets are wind assets, so - and as we go forward with the transactions, we don't see any issues with that. And as a matter of fact, even on the regulated side, the timing of which we actually need assets for solar and that kind of thing comes later. So it's a 2024/2025 timeframe. So on both sides of the ledger we're in good shape from that perspective and these assets, obviously we're going to try to time it appropriately as we talked about the large portion of the 1.6 gigawatts or the 1,600 megawatts, they will be marketed in the third quarter. And I'd say, we're getting very robust. It's amidst very robust interest on - really on both sides, strategics and in terms of any type of private equity that kind of thing. So, it's really to us, the process will continue and there is nothing stopping us. So, we're in good shape from that perspective. And then your second part of your question, Julie, did you have that part? Julie Sloat : Yes and Julien, let me know if I'm not answering this directly or if you need a little more granularity. Specifically as it relates to dollar flows associated with any type of transaction that we enter into, so today you're going to talk about the fact that we've had a term sheet in place for five development sites, those dollars are still small. And so, we'll see those, show up eventually priced second quarter or third quarter in operating earnings. But obviously - not even disclosing those not a needle mover for us and not going to change the earnings guidance or anything like that, so not to worry on that front. And then as it relates specifically to the broader unregulated renewables contracted portfolio, we'll start the marketing effort in the second half of this year. Obviously, we'll continue as we have a little more detail to share. We do have an upcoming on investor conference, so stay tuned for that, and then we'll be able to navigate any potential proceeds from transactions. As you know, we don't - even know exactly how that's ultimately going to look, do we sell them as an entire portfolio? Do we sell them in different pieces? So that's to be determined, so standby on that. And then obviously, we continue to work through the Kentucky process. We had expected to close that - we're trending toward the second quarter. As Nick mentioned and I mentioned in my opening remarks, that's already reflected as it relates to Kentucky bringing dollars in, in our plan. You may recall that we eliminated about $1.4 billion of equity that we originally had in our 2022 guidance. So I think we're moving on track. Let me know if there is something I didn't address there. Nick Akins : Yes and since we're really moving on the universal scale assets, they're project specific. So we can go through that process and time at anyway that we wish to do it, so that's - and actually they are actual pretty quickly. So, we'll go through that process and will define that better and that will be part of our Analyst Day discussion. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Now speaking Analyst Day discussion, just super quick if I can, an important point. How do you think about just approaching your customers directly with energy prices environment, doing well on industrial and C&I sales growth, presumably your customers are interested. We heard this from Entergy, can you kind of elaborate how you're thinking about that opportunity here in this elevated environment as a further angle to your renewable aspiration? Nick Akins : Well, certainly the renewables are a key part of being able to really mitigate cost to consumers going forward. So, from an industrial standpoint and manufacturing standpoint, we're going to see a lot of that movement to our territory, because when you think about onshoring, when you think about strategic reviews of supply chain actions that need to occur within this country, that's going to occur within our territory. So our focus will be, I think from the renewable side, particularly the regulated renewable side to be able to continue to progress on that is a benefit because a clear benefit for customers and certainly North Central showed that, but I think from an industrial standpoint, it's going to look very good for us. We have the resources for capacity and when you layer in the renewables for the incremental needs of capacity, it's really the best of both worlds to provide reliable secure supply to our industrials and really at a competitive price. So I think we're in great shape from that perspective going forward. Operator : Next we'll go to Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Steve Fleishman : That is enthusiastic for me, sorry. So, just on the Kentucky process, there does seem to be a decent amount of people that want different things on the Mitchell operating agreement. Can you just talk to your confidence in resolving those issues by the second quarter and just because - and just maybe frame the issues and how you think they can get resolved? Nick Akins : Yes, obviously there has been a lot of focus on the Mitchell agreements themselves and we've certainly tried to accommodate the multiple parties that are involved and made as flexible as possible and obviously the issue is 2028 and how you reconcile that going forward. And from a state perspective, I think we're in a good place, because it does provide the flexibility to find whatever value proposition there is at that point and there also is optionality around the ability to potentially separate the units to allow each individual commission to make their own decisions relative to these units. So, I think it's positioned very well. There's been a lot of dialog, lot of settlement discussions associated with that and a lot of - of course there's a lot of varied opinions, but at the end of the day, we have to do this because we have two commissions that are going in different directions relative to the life of the Mitchell plant. And I think what we've arrived to is a very credible balanced view that allows the optionality that the parties need going forward, so. And of course, we certainly will continue to focus on the ELG and CCR expense associated with that in the appropriate manner, and that will improve the optionality going forward to where decision is going to be made at the appropriate time. But I would say we're in a good place as we expect, we expect the Mitchell approvals to occur very quickly after the transaction approval. Steve Fleishman : Okay, great. Thank you. And then just, you've been pretty good and right about Federal, the BBB legislation kind of to get done or whatever you want to call it these days, just curious if you have any latest thoughts and updates there - has anything changed? Nick Akins : I'll say, I'll say this. Certainly, Senator Manchin is at the center of all of this, but there also is, I think from their original infrastructure package, a group of senators who were coming together to try to focus on some pretty substantial issues and really when you think about Senator Manchin being on both the Armed Services Committee and the Energy Committee and knowing the Ukraine situation and the focus on energy as it relates to it. I think you're going to see at least an attempt to a lot of focus on how to support natural gas, LNG, expansion for pipeline capability, and then of course he has also talked about the climate provisions, and I think there'll be a lot of interest too in the technologies of the hydrogen hubs and particularly in West Virginia. And then there is obviously Murkowski, Barrasso, there is others that they are engaging in that discussion. The ITCs, PTCs, the climate provisions that the industry is looking for, I think there is some bipartisan level of support for that. So the question really is, can they get together before - really before Memorial Day. And if there is still talking after Memorial Day it's probably a positive indication. My own personal belief is, if it's not successful, we'll probably see in the 11th hour type of - at the end of the year relative to ITCs and PTCs and perhaps Steve, an expansion of those. So I think you'll see us attempted a smaller bill, you'll still get hung up with the pay for, particularly with Manchin wanting to get it paid for and it's obviously a different, different view on that. So, but there is probably some element of recognition that something has to be done to have this country focus on the security of supply, not only for our sales that the Ukraine situation is demonstrated, but also for Europe and the rest of the world. So that's probably the impetus of getting something done and will define the framework of whether something gets done or not. If it doesn't after the election, I think like I said, it's the 11th hour or perhaps the RS and Treasury make adjustments based upon what's happened relative to supply chain activities. So, I think that would be my view of where things are going. Operator : Next we will go to Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead. Shar Pourreza : Just - Nick, I just want to question on sort of the renewable comments. As we're looking kind of at your current RFPs that are in progress, there sort of a fairly healthy mix between wind and solar and storage. As we're thinking about kind of the upcoming 2021, 2022 RFPs, how are you sort of thinking about the potential tail risks around solar with circumvention investigation as pricing uncertainties, there is a lot of constraints. I guess these tail risk impact the mix for 2021 and 2022 and do you see any risk to the $8.2 billion you've allocated to renewables. I mean, we've already seen two peers provided some warnings around this and one this morning, as well as delays. So I'm just curious how this fits in with your plan? Nick Akins : Yes. I don't see a lot of risk and the reason why is, because ours is more 2030, a lot of these projects will come into play in the 2024, 2025 timeframe. So, we have time for not only for the reviews of solar that's occurring with the administration, but also in terms of the supply chain activities just to level out somewhat before we're actually out back in the market acquiring these types of resources. So, we have a little bit of time, I think probably by first quarter next year we want to see things start to levelize so that we can get that process rolling. In the meantime, we got the resource planning filings that are being made. And keep in mind too, I made this point originally. These plans are really fungible from year to year based upon what we see in terms of the value proposition of each type of resources. So a lot of its wind, some of it's solar, solar picks up in the later years from a resource plan perspective, so there is time for the solar thing to get resolved. But even if it doesn't, that sales is probably going to be more wind or other types of resources that are put in place to support these objectives, because remember, they're driven by capacity requirements and we'll continue to evaluate that process. And I'll take a step further too on this is, we've always said that if something were they happen relative to the renewables build out, we've got transmission and transmission we can soak up a lot of capital from that perspective because of the focus on providing better customer service, more resilient and reliable grid. So we have that optionality, but I'm not, I'm not even there yet. I think we're - we may be because the $8.2 billion we have in there assumes a certain percentage of those types of resources that we would own. That could be higher, transmission could be higher. So we have optionality around all of that. So I'm not concerned from an AEP perspective. Shar Pourreza : Sure. The current gas price environment helps the economic argument. Nick Akins : Absolutely, absolutely because the $3 billion for North Central was down on our previous gas forecast and if you look at that today, it's probably much larger. I think it's really looking good for customers. Shar Pourreza : Got it, got it. And Nick, just from a financing perspective is, we're thinking about incremental spending that's going to come from these future RFPs. Can you just be a little bit more specific on your prepared comments around further asset sales, I mean, you look at all your OpCos that remain, I guess what could a structure look like, what remains? Nick Akins : Yes, so - and the point I'm making is obviously we're going through the process step by step with the unregulated contracted renewables parts, so there is different parts of that business. And then of course, just - I think Kentucky was the first shot at it. There is a lot of optimization that can occur. We'll just have to evaluate against what the opportunities look like. And if we're - if we have, I mean, if we have underperforming utilities that don't figure prominently into the, into the clean energy transformation where we're actually attracting capital and being able to provide higher levels of return, then we have to look at it, so. So I'm just saying that, that process will continue regardless, not saying and actually we're already too deep, and I've talked about the number too deep. In terms of sales, Kentucky, we still have to get across and then the contracted renewables, we still get across. And then we'll see where we're at that point, based upon what we're getting in terms of the feedback of the RFPs because when these RFPs are ultimately get approved, they will know exactly what the ownership looks like, what the financial requirements are and we'll do what we've always done. We'll make sure that we're going through this process, making to invest in the right places and we will look at the portfolio and see what makes sense and what doesn't make sense for us to continue to optimize that for shareholder benefit. Shar Pourreza : And then just one quick follow-up from Steve's question is, obviously we appreciate the confidence around the operating agreement in the Kentucky sale and reiterating the timing of the deal, but just to book ended, assuming there is maybe an adverse ruling or something that's not palatable. Can you just remind us, I think does Algonquin have a material adverse change clause? Is there a timeframe when they could walk away from the deal as we're just thinking about a book end? Nick Akins : It's typical to have those kinds of provisions in that kind of agreement, but I can tell you that we and Algonquin are arm-in-arm getting this thing across the finish line. They very much want to own this property and they've actually - they've actually stepped up in a considerable way to provide customer benefits to make this transaction attractive to the policymakers and to the customers. So, and of course - I think a seminal event here obviously is May 4th where the commission will come out with an order and we will look at that order, we will make determinations on what conditions are in place and at that point in time, we'll make decisions on what it looks like. But I think from the public interest standpoint, the things that the commission also be looking at, this transaction is very, very good for Kentucky customers and if there are - I think everyone has to be sort of level headed about all of this because when you get through this process, you actually have a - you have a timeframe now for customer benefits to occur, substantial benefits and that's really a driver to get this thing done as quickly as possible, particularly in this energy related environment. So, I really don't anticipate that happening, but if it did, we'll do what we always do, we'll figure out what the options are and what the possibilities are and go from there. But right now we're not planning on that. Operator : And next we'll go to the line of Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Jeremy Tonet : Just want to pivot a little bit towards transmission here, and given the MISO planning makes a little bit outside of you guys footprint, but also as you mentioned the FERC transmission planning and AEP stepping up CapEx towards Transmission here. Just wondering if you could dive in a little bit more as far as what's - which specific areas projects might materialize or any other color you can provide on specific transmission opportunities incremental at this point? Nick Akins : Well, typically, and we've done this, we actually plan for around 130% of the budget for transmission. So we have 30% more projects that are occurring that we already have planned scoped ready to go. So layering in these multiple projects is a way for us to not only as opportunities arrive, as the metrics for financials continue to improve, we can layer in more of that, we can adjust to that based on projects that go one way or another. And then also, recently we were awarded in Texas - a large project in Texas that's also incremental. So, it was like $1.3 billion or so, but that - those are the kinds of things that will come to pass and we have every bit of opportunity related to transmission not only within our own system, but also in terms of the incremental systems around us, and that's why - and you asked about FERC and transmission, FERC obviously is taking the right steps relative to long-term planning, getting the framework for long-term planning put in place. That's an important part of the process to speed up some of the planning aspects to ensure that we are making the right investments at the right places. We continue and I think FERC will continue to look at, even in parallel, these issues of cost allocation of even the incentive mechanism, but also in terms of - and the regional planning which AEP will bode well in terms of that because just about everyone interfaces with us. So, as you look at some of these aspects, the more renewables that are needed, certainly the more retirements that are occurring across RTOs is all going to bode well for transmission investment. And we - what we see today is not we're going to see tomorrow. And then if FERC is doing the right thing, which we think they are, is going to bolster the ability for us to have a more consistent, congruent, clean-energy type system across this nation and you can't do that without AEP. Jeremy Tonet : Got it, thank you for that. And just shifting gears towards O&M, just wondering what trends you're seeing there? It looks like it was a nickel benefit and Vertically Integrated a little bit of a headwind in transmission and distribution, and just wondering if you could dive in a little bit more as far as what different trends you're seeing in O&M across the business? Julie Sloat : Yes, happy to, Jeremy, this is Julie. I did call specifically out, the O&M trend in Vertically Integrated Utilities. There's a little bit of a flipping and twitching going on between O&M and depreciation associated with the Rockport Unit II lease. That's included in that 2022 guidance that we had provided to you back in February, we've updated that page for your, so entirely consistent. Yes, and we're absolutely watching O&M as we continue to navigate inflationary pressures, et cetera. At this point, I would tell you, I think we're right in line with where we thought we'd be. So we're keeping our fingers crossed and the team is working like heck to make sure that we've got supply chain and supply chain is being addressed et cetera. But at this point, that guidance that we gave to you stands pat. So nothing new to report other than the fact that the team is working really hard to make sure that those numbers coming in line to the extent that we have many new developments, we will surely keep you apprised. Operator : And next we'll go to Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Durgesh Chopra : Congrats, this is a solid print here. Most of my questions have been asked and answered. I just had a quick clarification as it relates to the Kentucky sale. The May 4th is when we get the order for transfer and control. Do we need to get sort of the Mitchell operating plan agreement before then or how does that play into the May 4th order? Nick Akins : No, that will likely come after shortly thereafter and the way we've looked at it is that, obviously you want the transfer agreement done. But as far as the Mitchell agreement approval, we expect that to occur shortly thereafter with both commissions because it's an important aspect of it and something I think that really helps for the transaction side as well. Durgesh Chopra : I understand. So they can actually issue an order, the Kentucky commission can before actually - on the trend or before resolving the Michelle sort of ongoing dates of different things. Nick Akins : That's right, that's right. Operator : And next we will go to Sophie Karp with Keybanc. Sophie Karp : Good morning. Thank you for including the names here at the end. Nick Akins : Yes, sure. Sophie Karp : I have a couple of questions here. So, first on the load growth, obviously very healthy numbers here. Above other industrial regions in the country, probably at this point. I'm not sure if two quarters is a trend, but let's say, how long do you need to see those numbers in this range that it would be enacting for maybe your reset in the long-term expectations for what this load should, does it make sense? Nick Akins : Yes, it's great question, because you're right, two quarters doesn't, it doesn't make a trend. But when you look at the economy within our service territory, we're seeing some very positive indicators for continued expansion and continued economic development. We are - our economic development people are extremely busy with multiple opportunities that are coming throughout our territory actually. And so we look at that, we look at the sort of - if you were to look at our pipeline of potential opportunities, it is extremely robust and that gives us confidence in terms of where we think the economy is going to continue to go within our service territory. And of course, we don't see an end to the work from home environment. So we're feeling much better about the prospects of a more robust residential side of things. And then on the industrial, like I said, the onshoring, the security aspects, the energy play within our service territory. The other aspects of what's going on within the territory with chemicals manufacturing and so forth, that pace has picked up markedly with expansions and new developments and some of them are still years away, like the NTL manufacturing here in Ohio in our territory. It's substantial there'll be 20 to 40 more companies associated with that. It will be locating. So you see those types of prerequisites that are being put in place, that gives us a lot of positive views about where we think the economy is going. We'll watch it, we'll continue to evaluate it. If we go to the third quarter, see the same thing and fourth quarter, the same thing, then you'll probably see some adjusting going on relative to the 2023 forecast, but that's - our load guy will have to tell us that, he is very objective and he's is a professor at one of the universities and he - usually he is - let me put it this way, he is probably more optimistic now than I've ever seen him and that's a good thing. Julie Sloat : Nick, if I can just jump in there with a finer point or two as well. And Sophie as I made comments in my opening remarks, we are still about 1.6% behind pre-pandemic levels on the industrial side of the house. But as I mentioned and as Nick mentioned, we do see expansions that are going to allow us to not only get pass that 1.6%, but to go beyond that. So we do expect to be beyond the pre-pandemic levels. And as a matter of fact, what we've seen so far this year in the first quarter is that six of our top 10 sectors were up. So that's a good indication. And then looking forward, we expect to see strong growth in oil and gas as new LNG operations ramp up in Texas and that began a few quarters back. So we're going to start to see the fruits of that efforts as well, but stay tuned. As you know, we typically, if we're going to revise guidance, we've historically done it once we get past our peak season, which is summer, but to be perfectly candid, we're looking at this constantly. So we will be back to you if there is anything that requires us to get new information in front of you, because we'll definitely want to take advantage of that. Sophie Karp : Perfect. Thank you. My other question is on the RFPs, not to beat the dead horse, I guess, but I can appreciate the fact that the projects are expected to be commissioned in 2024, 2025 timeframe, which is a couple of years away to sort out the physical disruption of equipment availability, et cetera. But in terms of pricing, what should be - typically bid into those RFPs, like what do you think they should be coming in terms of pricing. Does that make it difficult with volatility in the pricing of equipment, particularly solar, and unpredictability really where we are with the solar market or storage market might be a year from now. Does it make the, I guess, the process more complicated or addressed with it. Nick Akins : Yes, I think it will make it more complicated, but not insurmountable, because whatever increases you may see from a solar perspective, the overall project benefits will still be part of it. Now it may change the relationship between wind and solar in the integrated resource plan. Solar may come later than what we thought because if wind continues to continues to progress as you go in our resource plan, a lot of it was when to start and then eventually it's based on pricing and everything else, solar would start to pick up and at some point overcome the wind asset and then you move into other technologies. That condition may change based on that, but you also, I mean, you'll probably see that in the framework of increased gas prices too. So really the renewables will be relative to each other not in terms of relative to whether they'll get done or not. So, and I really think we'll be in good shape from that perspective. The other part two is that, when you look at the other resources, really what you're doing is, you're putting in renewables and you're also layering in some natural gas in the plan to really give it 24/7 supplier. Natural gas also is a placeholder for other types of resources, whether it's hydrogen, whether it's small modular reactors, whatever that comes about with new technologies and the grid optimization itself will be a major part of that as well with transmission. So there is a multitude of answers there that will occur. But, yes, you're right, you would suspect solar, there'll be some short-term perturbation from an increase perspective that we'll have to deal with. But in the overall scheme of things, when you look at long-term, it will still be positive. Operator : And our last question comes from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Michael Lapides : Nick, thanks for taking my questions. I have two and they are a little bit unrelated. I'm going to the appendices of your slide deck. I'm looking at what you used to call kind of, I don't know, the money chart, the ROE chart for trailing 12 month, the equalizer chart, thank you. And one of the things that stands out as public serve Oklahoma, just curious if you can talk a little bit about PSO and a little bit about maybe SWEPCO in APCo where the earned ROEs are decent bit below 8% and just kind of how you think about the trajectory of quote-unquote fixing the split between earned and authorized. Nick Akins : Yes, so at SWEPCO we have rate cases there in two of the jurisdictions and PSO, we will have a rate case as well. And, but keep in mind too, we just brought in all of the renewables in play, particularly a large chunk of it for PSO and SWEPCO. So that's now rolling through rates and so we expect that to continue to pick up, those are - and really when you look at the industrial and manufacturing economic development part of what's going on in those jurisdictions, they are still very positive. So, and of course we continue to invest heavily in those jurisdiction so, and that's why we have equalizer chart that some of the peer lower until we file rate cases and when the investment changes itself, so we're not concerned by that at this point and actually we see PSO and the SWEPCO jurisdictions with Arkansas, Louisiana, in particular, very favorable. Michael Lapides : Got it, okay. And then one follow-up and this may be just a checking in on what was in our original guidance, but just curious, for the transmission segment, how much do you think  down a little bit on a net income and EPS perspective year-over-year for the first quarter. Can you remind me what you think the earnings growth trajectory is for the transmission segment in 2022 relative to 2021 and kind of the drivers behind that? Julie Sloat : Yes, and so, Michael, I don't have my guidance sheet in front of me for 2022, it's in our presentation that we put out there and our fourth quarter call, but effectively and actually somebody is going to hand it well, and going to hand it to me. But effectively, what we were anticipating was that year-over-year we'd be up about $0.08 and that was driven by investment growth being up $0.12. I mentioned this actually in my opening comments as well and then we had a true up that would occur and we knew that was going to be embedded. That's why we have it in the guidance, that's associated with the fact -- Nick Akins : The true up was positive the previous year, and yes, sort of double count. Julie Sloat : It would - so it's flipping back and forth so. So we had two reasons for that true up. I mean, we had spent just a little bit under our budget for the prior year and as you know, we got forward looking rate. So that's a catch up there and then we had higher load, so we had a catch up there too, so we get a little bit of a double-counting there. But that's why we had the 11% reduction in that true up. And then we had other financing and income taxes that kind of brought that number back down to, flip it to a negative $0.08. So in aggregate, for 2022, we assume that we'd have about $1.27 from that particular segment, again driven by investment growth, offset by a couple of these other bucket items that I threw out there. We are on that trajectory. And that's why I specifically called that out in my opening comments, because if I was trying to model this, that's exactly what I'd be asking. Michael Lapides : So then the growth would be more into the year --? Julie Sloat : It's, I guess, it's priced fair enough. We're a little short on the first quarter. But yes, I would just expect that we'll continue to see transmission investment continue to plug along through the remainder of the year, at this point, we don't have any changes as it relates to that specific guidance. And we have it out there year-by-year in our guidance forecast and assumptions pages in our traditional Investor Relations materials. Happy to walk through with you offline, if you'd like to do that too. Michael Lapides : I appreciate it. Thank you guys. Super-duper helpful and much appreciated you taking the time to get to my questions. Nick Akins : Sure thing. Thanks Michael. Darcy Reese : Thank you for joining us on today's call.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Welcome to the American Electric Power Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all lines are in a listen-only mode. Later there will be an opportunity for questions-and-answers session.  And as a reminder, your conference call is being recorded. I'll now turn the conference call over to your host, Vice President of Investor Relations, Darcy Reese. Go ahead. Darcy Reese : Thank you Alan. Good morning, everyone and welcome to the second quarter 2022 earnings call for American Electric Power. We appreciate you taking the time to join us today. Our earnings release presentation slides and related financial information are available on our website at aep.com. Today we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors. Joining me this morning for opening remarks are Nick Akins, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Julie Sloat, our Chief Financial Officer. We will take your questions following their remarks. I will now turn the call over to Nick. Nick Akins : Okay. Thanks Darcy. Welcome everyone to American Electric Power's second quarter 2022 earnings call. AEP continues to make progress on the strategic initiatives we announced earlier this year with strong execution against our plan resulting in another solid quarter. Later in the call Julie will walk you through our second quarter performance drivers including the strong load increases we're experiencing in our territory, as well as provide additional details surrounding our financial position. But I'll start with the key financial highlights for the quarter. We'll then move to an update on our Kentucky operations sale process and timeline. I will also spend time discussing the progress we are making in our transition to a clean energy future as we simplify and derisk our business profile by divesting unregulated renewable assets while maintaining focus on our responsible generation fleet transformation and regulated renewables execution. I will close by providing some additional insights into our ongoing regulatory activities including our transmission business. We are very pleased with our positive momentum this quarter, delivering operating earnings of $1.20 per share or $618 million. We are moving full speed ahead towards the increased operating earnings guidance range and long-term earnings growth rate we provided during our fourth quarter 2021 earnings call and we are reaffirming both financial targets this quarter. As a reminder we are guiding to an operating earnings guidance range of $4.87 to $5.07 per share for 2022 with a $4.97 midpoint and a long-term earnings growth rate of 6% to 7%. We are also continuing to ensure we are best positioned for value creation as we navigate the macro trends impacting our industry and the broader economy. We are working with states to drive expansion in our service territory while considering global economic uncertainty inflationary pressures and of course customer bills. We're also diversifying our mix of suppliers to minimize supply chain disruptions for our customers in business while also lessening the impact on our capital investment plan. We know that timing of the closing of the sale of Kentucky Power and AEP Kentucky Transco to Liberty as top of mind, and we have been working with Liberty to obtain the approvals necessary for closing this summer. A regulatory timeline of the sale can be found on slide seven of today's presentation. We are pleased to report the Kentucky Commission approved the key milestone in the transaction with an order approving the sales transfer in early May. As we have discussed previously a prerequisite in our contract of Liberty for closing the sale is approving the approval of new Mitchell operating agreements by both the Kentucky Public Service Commission and the West Virginia Public Service Commission. While we receive the related Mitchell orders from the Kentucky Commission on May 3 and the West Virginia Commission on July 1, the two states approved the operating agreement with different formats and some divergent post 2028 plant provisions. However, through the two proceedings, both commissions have indicated an ability to use the existing agreement as a basis to operate the plant going forward and accomplish their differing expectations for investment in operations. For that reason, on July 11, we made a compliance filing in West Virginia, and filed an update with Kentucky, providing an alternative way to move forward with Mitchell operations in the near term. We inform both commissions that we will operate under the existing agreement and manage the new operational focus of the two commissions through the operating committee. In the absence of any new agreements, the existing Mitchell operating agreement is still in effect and we believe, no additional regulatory approvals should be required. Since regulatory approval of the new Mitchell operating agreements is a prerequisite in our contract with Liberty for the closing. In the absence of such proposal, we are working with Liberty on the commercial solution for Mitchell-related operations and both parties remain optimistic about reaching a resolution and closing the transaction. At this time, the only regulatory matter currently pending is the 203 application at FERC related to the cell transfer, which FERC is currently considering. We are in the final stages of the Kentucky operations sale process and expect to close this summer. Moving to our unregulated renewable portfolio, in May, we closed on the sale of five unregulated development sites located in the Southwest Power Pool area, marking the successful divestiture of the majority of our wind and solar development assets. As we mentioned last quarter, we have also signed an agreement to sell a solar development site in Ohio, with that transition close expected also in the third quarter. In addition, we are in discussions with an interested party sale of our Flat Ridge II Wind Farm ownership, consisting of 235 megawatts, simplifying the resulting portfolio for our upcoming auctions. These milestones demonstrate our commitment to continued execution. As we announced during our fourth quarter earnings call in February, we are selling our unregulated contracted renewables portfolio in order to simplify and derisk the company and facilitate investment in our regulated businesses. We are in the final stages of preparation of the marketing materials for the auction and expect an official launch of the process no later than early September. After the removal Flat Ridge II, the portfolio consists of 1,365 megawatts of contracted renewable assets, consisting of 1,200 megawatts of wind and 165 megawatts of solar, geographically diversified throughout the US. There has been robust, inbound interest in the portfolio and we expect the process to proceed quickly. As a reminder, utilization of contracted renewable sale proceeds is not yet reflected in our multiyear financing plan. We remain focused on maximizing transaction proceeds and directing additional capital to our regulated businesses, where we have meaningful pipeline of investment opportunities to better serve our customers, as we push toward a clean energy future and enhanced transmission infrastructure. As always, we are open-minded and we'll evaluate all value-additive potential activities, as we focus on our regulated businesses, where we see meaningful long-term opportunities for growth. AEP continues to make significant progress in our transition to clean energy resources through our regulated renewables execution. Details regarding the specific actions we are taking can be found on slides eight and nine in today's presentation. We are also firmly grounded in our principles of resiliency, reliability and affordability while recognizing the increasing value of our diverse resource portfolio against the backdrop of energy-related volatility. SWEPCO is taking steps to secure renewable resources, making regulatory filings in May in Arkansas, Louisiana and Texas to own three renewable turnkey projects totaling 999 megawatts. This $2.2 billion investment is currently reflected in our five-year $38 billion capital plan. SWEPCO expects to issue another RFP in the near term consistent with its RFP for energy and capacity needs. APCo's 409 megawatts of owned solar and wind resources were approved by West Virginia and Virginia, marking an $841 million capital investment that is also included in our current capital plan. Request for a proposal are in process in APCo, O&M and PSO with expected in-service dates in the year-end 2024 and 2025 timeframe. We also expect to make regulatory filings to acquire additional renewable resources prior to year-end 2022. Finally the US Supreme Court ruling at the end of June related to the federal EPA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s regulation of greenhouse gas emissions will not require any changes to AEP's current generation and compliance planning. Our generation fleet transformation plans are well on track. We remain fully committed to our target of an 80% carbon reduction emission -- emission reduction rate by 2030 and net zero by 2050 and we are proud of the work well underway at AEP to help us achieve this goal. Reaching these targets is foundational to our long-term strategy and we believe we are on the right path toward prioritizing regulated investment opportunities and transitioning our generation fleet. Turning now to a brief update on our regulatory activity. Our regulated ROE as of the end of June 2022 is 9.2%. We continue to work through regulatory cases and maintain our focus on reducing our authorized versus actual ROE spreads. Additional regulatory activity in the quarter included a commission order received in May on SWEPCO's Arkansas rate case, including a 9.5% ROE, marking a net revenue increase of $28 million and a capital structure of 55% debt to 45% equity. We are also expecting a decision on SWEPCO's losing out a rate case in the third quarter. Oral arguments related to APCo's 2020 Virginia base case were held in March 2022 at the Virginia Supreme Court, with an anticipated final decision later this year. FERC recently initiated several rule-making proceedings related to transmission planning, cost allocation, generation interconnection to the transmission grid and extreme weather preparedness. We support the commission in these actions and are in full support -- full agreement that that reform is needed to build the infrastructure necessary to transition our generation fleet in the most efficient and cost-effective way possible, while also helping achieve our carbon reduction goals. These proposed rules align with AEP\u00e2\u0080\u0099s objectives of developing a more robust, reliable and flexible grid of the future that ultimately reduces cost to customers and strengthens economic development in our communities. Before I turn it over to Julie, I want to take a moment to thank our team for the incredible work that they are doing as we execute against our strategic objectives and deliver for our stakeholders. What's going on today at AEP is a perfect blend of the execution of Bachman\u00e2\u0080\u0093Turner Overdrive\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \"Takin' Care Of Business\" with the edge of Prince\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \"Let's Go Crazy\" in a good sense, of course. We have an incredible market position, a bold mission and the foundation in place to achieve our goals to deliver on our vision of further modernizing our energy grid in order to supply reliable, cleaner, low-cost resources for all the communities serve. As we think about the future and the next chapter of AEP, we're excited to share more about our plans at AEP's upcoming Analyst Day on October 4 in New York City. We will provide additional detail soon and look forward to seeing you there. Julie, over to you. Julie Sloat : Thanks, Nick. Thanks, Darcy. It's good to be with everyone this morning. Good morning and thanks for dialing in. I'm going to walk us through our second quarter and year-to-date results, share some updates on our service territory load, and finish with commentary on our credit metrics and liquidity as well as some thoughts on our guidance, financial targets, and then recap our current portfolio management activities underway. So let's go to slide 10 which shows the comparison of GAAP to operating earnings. GAAP earnings for the second quarter were $1.02 per share compared to $1.16 per share in 2021. GAAP earnings through June were $2.43 per share compared to $2.31 per share in 2021. There's a detailed reconciliation of GAAP to operating earnings on pages 18 and 19 of the presentation today, but I'd like to call out three of the reconciling items that do not affect operating earnings, but relate to our asset optimization activities underway. Specifically, you'll see that we made an adjustment to arrive at our operating for the quarter and year-to-date periods consisting of Kentucky sale costs and the write-off of one of the unregulated universal scale wind projects that's included in the portfolio. We're in the process of preparing for sale. The Kentucky sale charge reflects an anticipated reduction in the sales price as we work with Liberty to accommodate adjustments for costs that have been identified through the regulatory approvals that we've received. Turning to the renewable investment write-off the Flat Ridge 2 projects specifically has continued to see deteriorating performance due to equipment issues and transmission congestions to avoid another otherwise necessary repowering investment to address the performance issue and complicate our portfolio sales process. We elected to write-off the equity investments are in discussions with an interested party for the sale of ownership interest in Flat Ridge 2. Consequently, this will remove the Flat Ridge 2 project from the portfolio we're preparing for auction, which should help improve the valuation opportunity as investors engage in the sales process, which is scheduled to launch no later than early September. Lastly, I'll mention that we monetize some mineral rights which give rise to a benefit to GAAP, but non-operating earnings, which helps offset the charges I just mentioned. So while I would typically not spend time walking through the GAAP to operating reconciliation, I thought it was appropriate at this time given the milestones we're clearing on the asset optimization front. And while these charges and gains are things that we need to recognize they are entirely driven by our efforts derisk, simplify and bring cash in the door to support our continued investment in the regulated business. So with that let's go to slide number 11 and walk through our quarterly operating earnings performance. Operating earnings for the second quarter totaled $1.20 per share or $618 million compared to $1.18 million per share or $590 million in 2021. Operating earnings for vertically integrated utilities were $0.59 per share up $0.14. Favorable drivers included rate changes across multiple jurisdictions, positive weather primarily in our western jurisdictions, increased transmission revenue and normalized retail load and income taxes. These items were somewhat offset by increased depreciation in O&M and lower off-system sales. Just as a reminder on the O&M and depreciation front, as I mentioned on the first quarter call and included in our 2022 guidance details because of a change in accounting related to the Rockport Unit 2 lease at I&M, we're seeing approximately $0.05 of favorable O&M offset by $0.05 of unfavorable depreciation in each quarter of 2022, but no consequential earnings impact. And so I'll have a little more to share on loan performance and I'll get to that in a minute here. So just hang with me. The Transmission and Distribution Utilities segment earned $0.32 per share, up $0.01 compared to last year. Favorable drivers in this segment included rate changes, load, positive weather in Texas and Ohio and increased transmission revenue. Offsetting these favorable items were unfavorable O&M and depreciation. AEP Transmission Holdco segment contributed $0.27 per share, down $0.07 compared to last year, favorable investment growth of $0.03 was more than offset by an unfavorable true-up of $0.07. As I mentioned last quarter, this is consistent with our guidance. Our 2022 guidance had this segment down by $0.08 year-over-year as a result of the $0.12 of investment growth being more than offset by the annual true-up that occurred this quarter and some favorable on comparisons on the tax and financing side. This segment continues to be an important part of our 6% to 7% EPS growth as you well know. Generation and Marketing produced $0.18 per share, up $0.09 from last year. The positive variance is primarily due to the sale of renewable development sites as well as increased generation margins and land sales. Finally, Corporate and Other was down $0.15 per share driven by lower investment gains increased income taxes and unfavorable interest. The lower investment gains are largely related to charge point gains that we had in the second quarter of 2021 that have reversed this year. The increased income taxes are related to the reduction of a consolidating tax adjustment at the parent. Let's turn to Slide 12 and our year-to-date operating earnings performance. Year-to-date operating earnings totaled $2.42 per share or $1.234 billion, compared to $2.33 per share or $1.160 billion in 2021. Operating earnings for the vertically integrated utilities were $1.18 per share, up $0.18. Similar to the quarter, favorable drivers included rate changes across multiple jurisdictions, positive weather mainly in our western jurisdictions, increased transmission revenue and normalized retail load and income taxes. These items were somewhat offset by increased depreciation and lower off-system sales. Once again the change in accounting around the Rockport Unit 2 lease results in $0.11 of favorable O&M offset by $0.11 of favorable -- unfavorable depreciation. The Transmission & Distribution Utilities segment earned $0.62 per share, up $0.08 compared to last year. Favorable drivers in this segment included rate changes in Texas and Ohio and increased normalized retail load and transmission revenue. Offsetting these favorable items were unfavorable O&M and depreciation. AEP Transmission Holdco segment $0.62 per share down $0.06 compared to last year. Favorable investment growth of $0.05 was more than offset by unfavorable true-up of $0.07 and increased property taxes. The Generation & Marketing segment produced $0.21 per share, up $0.05 from last year. The positive variance is primarily due to the sale of renewable development sites and increased wholesale margins offset by lower retail margins. Finally, Corporate and Other was down $0.16 per share driven by lower investment gains, unfavorable interest and increased O&M. The lower investment gains again are largely related to charge point gains that we had in 2021 that have reversed this year. Turning to Slide 13. I'm going to provide an update on our normalized load and performance for the quarter. And in general sense the AEP service territory has made significant momentum despite the well-publicized headwinds impacting the macro economy. Starting in the upper left corner, normalized residential sales increased by 1.2% in the second quarter and were up 1% year-to-date compared to 2021. This growth was comprised of growth in both customer counts and weather-normalized usage for both comparisons. While the results were mixed by operating the strongest residential growth was in the AEP Texas service territory, which consistently has the strongest customer growth across the AEP system due to favorable demographics. Moving to the right. Weather normalized commercial sales were up 4.1% compared to last year for both the quarter and year-to-date comparison. This consistent growth in 2022 is spread throughout the service territory. The growth in the commercial sales segment was spread across every operating company and nine of our 10 commercial sectors the only top commercial sector that is down versus last year's hospitals, which makes sense given that hospitalizations have dropped earlier in the pandemic. On the flip side, the fastest growing commercial sector is data centers were loaded up 32% compared to last year. Finally, focusing on the lower left corner, you see that industrial sales posted another strong quarter up 5% for the quarter, and up 5.3% year-to-date compared to last year. Industrial sales were up at every operating company in most of our largest sectors. We experienced double-digit growth in a number of key industries this quarter, including chemicals manufacturing and oil and gas extraction. We also saw robust growth in primary metals manufacturing, paper manufacturing, petroleum products, and coal mining. To summarize, we've experienced broad-based growth throughout the service territory on top of a recovery year. Every operating company has increased its sales in 2022 compared to last year. Growth is also consistent across every major retail class and most of the top commercial and industrial sectors served by AEP. We know the headlines are full of messages about a pending recession, but our sales statistics through the first half of the year show our service territory is still firmly in the expansion phase of the business cycle. We're mindful of the difficult monetary policy decisions being contemplated by the Federal Reserve to address inflationary pressures in the economy and recognize some of these decisions could impact our customer's growth opportunities going forward. But so far we're seeing little evidence that has dampened the economic activity within our footprint through the first two quarters of this year. Moving to slide 14, I want to provide additional context to the load we experience \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we've experienced so far in 2022, and how it compares to our pre-pandemic sales levels. Starting with the chart on the left, the bars show how the second quarter sales compared to the pre-pandemic baseline in the second quarter of 2019. You'll notice that, the total retail sales are 3.6% above pre-pandemic levels. Furthermore, every class is showing higher sales than before the pandemic began. This means that every class is fully recovered and is in the expansion phase of the business cycle. The chart on the right shows the same comparisons for the year-to-date period. You'll notice that, while the numbers are slightly different the message is the same. Through June AEP's normalized sales are 2% above the pre-pandemic levels. And just like the quarter, every class has exceeded pre-pandemic levels on a year-to-date basis. Last year's strong growth numbers were expected considering it was a recovery year from the pandemic shutdowns. This year's growth is perhaps even more impressive considering, the growth as compared to a strong recovery year. We'll continue to monitor the economy and its impact on our load over the summer months and we'll provide the results of our updated load forecast this fall. So let's move on to slide 15 to discuss the company's capitalization and liquidity position. On a GAAP basis, our debt-to-capital ratio decreased 0.1% from the prior quarter to 61.4%. Taking a look at the upper right quadrant on this page, you'll see that our FFO to debt metric stands at 13.4% on a Moody's basis, and 13.3% on a GAAP basis, which is a decrease of 0.3% and 0.4% respectively from the prior quarter. The slight decrease can be attributed to an increase in deferred fuel balances, as well as a slight increase in balance sheet debt. As we stated on our last earnings call, we anticipate trending toward our targeted FFO to debt range of 14% to 15% as the year progresses. You can see our liquidity summary on the lower right of the slide our five-year $4 billion bank revolver and our two-year $1 billion revolving credit facility support our liquidity position, which remains strong at $4.7 billion. On the qualified pension front, while our funding status decreased 0.8% during the quarter, it remains comfortably strong at 105.6%. Negative returns on risk seeking and fixed income assets during the quarter were the primary drivers of the funded status decrease. However rising interest rates caused plan liabilities to decrease which provided a favorable offset to the negative asset returns.  So, let's go to Slide 16 for a quick recap of today's message. The second quarter has provided a solid foundation for the rest of 2022 and we are reaffirming our operating earnings guidance range of $4.87 to $5.07. We continue to be committed to our long-term growth rate of 6% to 7%. We continue to work through the Kentucky Power sale to Liberty and are on-track for a closing later this summer and we'll be launching the auction process for our unregulated contracted renewables business, no later than early September.  So, before I hand things over to the operator, I'd like to mention one thing. We had previously announced that we would be having an investor conference this year and we've set a date for that. As Nick mentioned we'll be hosting at our investor conference in New York City on October 4. So, we really do appreciate your time and attention today. With that I'm going to ask the operator to open the call so we can hear what's on your mind and take any questions that you have. Operator :  We'll first go to the line of Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Go ahead. Nick Akins : Good morning, Jeremy. Jeremy Tonet : Just wanted to start off with load growth trends if I could. Just want to confirm here the full year load growth estimates have not been updated for year-to-date actuals or is there any reason to expect to fall off in the back half year? Julia Sloat : That is correct. We have not updated anything yet. We are cautiously optimistic. We'll give you an updated view as we get closer to our Analyst Day or at our Analyst Day on October 4. So, stand by for that. As far as what you can expect for the second half, you know if I look at for example the residential load, obviously talk of recession and how inflation is outpacing wage growth could potentially have residential customers shift in their behavior a little bit. We'll see.  So we're \u00e2\u0080\u0093 again, we're cautiously optimistic there, but we do expect that it could be a little bit tempered on this particular customer segment by inflation energy cost, mortgage rates the lack of new stimulus those things that everybody knows about. So no surprise there but just general trends. So we're going to continue to keep a close eye on that particular segment.  On the Commercial segment, I mentioned earlier that we had great performance in nine of the top sectors -- of our 10 top sectors with hospitals being the only one that was down. Again, we're keeping an eye on things like inflation, labor shortages, supply chain and borrowing costs. But again, at this point we don't have a reason to shift away and things continue to click along there.  And similar on the industrial side, we see a lot of large customer expansions that are expected to come online throughout the rest of the year, which should support the momentum, but at the end we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re cautiously optimistic because we know that the federal reserve has a big job in front of it and it has to tap the brakes. So, we'll see how that ultimately impacts all of these. But so far, we're in a really good place a really good place. So hang tight and we'll be able to give you a little more granular view in terms of our expectations when we come to you this fall. Nick Akins : We said, we told you I guess, it's probably a quarter or two ago, about reinforcing our service territory particularly, as it relates to energy and as it relates to onshoring. And our \u00e2\u0080\u0093 certainly, our territory has been very strong in terms of both of those categories manufacturing as well. And that's clearly, become a benefit for us. So -- and really when you think about what's going on in the world today, associated with security aspects, that's really going to drive more towards the ability for onshoring to occur and certainly, for energy security. So it bodes well for our territory. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. That's, great to hear there. And just want to pick up with -- I guess, we'll hear more details at the Analyst Day on these points with lower growth but also wanted to see what else, we might expect to hear at the Analyst Day. I suspect, the sales processes will get some more color there but is there anything else we should be looking for at the Analyst Day? Nick Akins : Yes. There's \u00e2\u0080\u0093 actually, you have the sales process. Obviously, everybody want to know about Kentucky, but also the unregulated contracted renewables there will be new data points on that as well. And then of course, a 2022 earnings guidance update, 2023 guidance range will be introduced and also we'll probably roll forward the five year capital and financing plans through 2027 and there could be other things too. So we will hold that till October 4. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. We'll wait for that. And just the last one, if I could. Any thoughts on the renewable sale whether it makes more sense to do as an entire pack \u00e2\u0080\u0093 package or in pieces I realize it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very early stages here, but just wondering if there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s any process share on that. Nick Akins : Yes. The team is working at that. And certainly, I think the base case would be to sell all at one time. But if there are opportunities exist to stage that out with the capital needs, that would great. so we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re still going through that process and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll go through as we talk earlier, we'll be going out to the market here in the September time frame. So we'll know a lot more at that point. So more to come October. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. Great. Thank you for that. Nick Akins : Yes. Operator : We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll go next to the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith. Go ahead. Nick Akins : Good morning., Julien. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hi. Good morning, team. Thanks for the opportunity. Appreciate it. So maybe just a follow-up in brief on this operating arrangement in the two states here. I mean -- just what do you need to see from Liberty to be able to move forward here at this point in time? I just want to make sure I understand, exactly. Is this just about them acquiescing to sort of the updated position from the two states, or do you really need to resolve, say a specific transfer value et cetera here. Nick Akins : Yes Julien. Certainly, Liberty has been great partners through this entire process. And we certainly, want to be fair to them because they were obviously, looking for certain things out of the transaction. We were looking for certain things. And I think, it's going to be just a matter of going through the process of defining risk, going forward. So it's not \u00e2\u0080\u0093 obviously, it's not as cut and dry and saying it's going to be the existing agreements and tough luck will move on. It's really an issue, where there is an opportunity for us to get together with them and define that future, because we're going to be partners in that individual going forward. So we might as well get comfortable with that relationship. 100%. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Yes. Nick, I noticed in the comment -- the various comments you made in the prepared remarks on inflation. Can you elaborate a little bit more in just to, how that ties into both near and longer term? Again I get that you guys are providing an update in a couple of months here. But just elaborate a little bit on the pressure points that you are seeing of late just if you can define that and how that's cascading through. Maybe speak a little bit to the cadence of labor arrangements for instance et cetera? Nick Akins : Yes, I missed the first part. Julia Sloat : Yes. Yes. Yes. So, Julien I'll let Nick talk a little bit about supply and labor. But what we're also watching is in addition to our own costs and working with our individual parties around making sure we have material supplies equipment and folks that actually do the work. We're also paying attention to what's going on with our customers because as we talked earlier today load is a big piece of our driver for earnings year-to-date and this quarter so far and we hope to see that continue. But as we know as the Fed needs to take some action and tap on the brakes that could have some damn as it relates to actually all three of our individual customer segments. Now, as I mentioned earlier, Industrial segment looks reasonably healthy based on the customer expansions that we see in the pipeline, et cetera. But I don't think everyone can entirely escape the consequences. So, even from a commercial standpoint, if you look at the real estate segment, in particular, interest rates have a direct impact on that piece of that sector in that business and then of course, on the residential side that choose into the wallet because if you're sitting in a situation where your wage isn't growing as quickly as your costs are you may tend to want to tap the brakes there. Not to mention mortgage costs go up as well. So, keeping an eye on it from a customer perspective managing through it as it relates to our particular P&L. But I don't know Nick wanted to say anything about supply chain and labor? Nick Akins : Yes. So -- and Julien sorry I missed the first part of your question. So, Julie filled in for me. Supply chain has certainly been an area of focus for the company and they've done a great job. The supply chain organization has done a great job of getting out ahead of that, understanding the delays that are occurring relative to delivery of transformers and those kinds of things. And then also size of inventories and other things come into question, but in our case we're a large electric utility with a lot of requirements, the largest transmission system in the country distribution obviously, wide spread. So, we have some -- we have abilities to really focus on the supply chain aspects in the positive way by expanding suppliers and certainly exerting the leverage we have associated with the large buying ability. So, we're in good shape from that perspective. Now, that being said, the entire industry and AEP are watching storm activity and those types of things and what implications that could have on the inventory levels and supply chain. So, we're watching that very closely. But we have time for the economy to really pick up and catch up from that perspective. Labor is an issue for everyone and certainly we continue to focus on that, particularly in our frontline employees to ensure that we're meeting the customers' requirements going forward. We're very tuned in to wage rates and those types of things that are changing dramatically. And certainly from a resource perspective we also have those relationships with not only attracting our own employees, but also contractors and so forth that we're able to pull from for various reasons. So, all-in-all, we're hanging in -- and the capital plan still remain secure in terms of the ability to move these projects forward. And we believe that AEP is in a great position to continue that process. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Super quick clarification on SPP, they're tweaked to the reserve margin. Does that impact your procurement efforts at all? I know you have a few things in flight just to clarify. Nick Akins : No it doesn't. We're going through -- yeah we're going through regular as you've probably seen regular integrated resource planning processes with all of the Southwestern power approval states. And those processes will continue. I guess the good thing is that the things that we're putting in obviously we already talked about transmission and distribution in terms of supply chain activities. But in terms of resources, we're already putting integrated resource plans in for renewables. And the timing of those renewables, are such that we have time for the supply chain to catch-up relative to solar and wind components. So we're in good shape from that perspective. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Great. Thank you, guys. Nick Akins : Sure. Operator : We'll go next to the line of Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Go ahead. Nick Akins : Good morning, Shar. Shar Pourreza : Good morning guys. How are you doing? Nick Akins : Fine, how are you? Shar Pourreza : Good. Nick just on the contracted renewable sales, we're kind of thinking about the process for the sale. There's obviously some conflicting data points out there right rates have picked up materially, there seems to be a few peers in the market selling as well. But on the other hand, just given supply chain issues deal on the ground is certainly more valuable. I guess, can you elaborate a bit more on the process when you plan on opening up the data rooms. And it's a tight time frame with the Analyst Day. So what data points can we get between September when you kick the process off in the Analyst Day which is only weeks process right? So I guess what's giving you a sense? Nick Akins : Yeah. So these are well-known resources. And they're already there. And opened up a data room, can be done pretty quickly. And also review will be done quickly. I would say that the interest has been very robust and it will continue to be robust, because -- and you said it they have steel in the ground, but also the ability to continue on with these projects in a very positive sense. We took out Flat Ridge 2, so that makes the portfolio even better. And certainly from that perspective we expect the process to move very quickly. And when we bought the resources some of these resources from Sempra we visited sites and the data room was open. And we moved very quickly. And for these types of assets even though there may be others that are selling the assets, there is a robust focus by the market on certainly attracting these types of assets. So we feel very confident. We can move forward quickly and have certainly more information this year by the time we get to the Analyst Day. Julie Sloat : Shar, this is Julie. As an anecdote, when we initially made this announcement, I can tell you that not only was I receiving calls Nick was receiving calls. Chuck Zebula whose team is running the process was receiving calls so a lot of inbound calls coming in. And as far as what you can anticipate, I get it it's a shorter time line assuming we launch at the very latest in early September we should be able to come back to you by October 4th with color on how that process is going. And you're right. I mean there are other folks in the market as well. That's why I think we need to get out there as soon as we can and get business taken care of. So that is absolutely the objective. And stay tuned we'll have more color to share with you. Shar Pourreza : Do you think you could actually announce a deal on the fourth of the proceeds or the tight. Nick Akins : No. Shar Pourreza : Okay. Nick Akins : Yeah, that will be too tough for that. Obviously and then that will depend on what we get back to in terms of one-time versus stage in all those types of things will have to be considered. And certainly we'll have more information, but we won't have a finalization of that'll be probably by the end of the year. Shar Pourreza : Got it. Got it. Thanks. And just one last one on \u00e2\u0080\u0093 I mean obviously your load growth and the backdrop in general has continued to show the ongoing strength, you highlight the fact that it's pre-pandemic levels. I guess how are you sort of thinking about 2022 in general and where you're within sort of that EPS range, especially given that we're kind of into the key months of the summer with Q3. I would think there's \u00e2\u0080\u0093 obviously \u00e2\u0080\u0093 this is a very strong tailwind for you especially as we're thinking about 2022, even though you guys are hedging ourselves a little bit on some of the uncertainties out there? Nick Akins : Yes. It's always good to be ahead a little bit. Any time you go in the latter part of the year because summer is always good. And then you get in the fourth quarter with \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you don't know where storm activity is going to go and that kind of thing. But we feel really good about the position that have right now. And certainly, if you look at the fundamentals of what's going on I mean, you take charge point out of it is a very, very positive quarter and certainly one in which we continue to grow and see it \u00e2\u0080\u0093 our load guys are pretty optimistic. So \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and if you knew our load guy, you know he's \u00e2\u0080\u0093 it takes a long way for him to get there. But we feel really good about the position that we have. And I think as we see more towards the end of the year then we'll have more to say when it comes by the time the Analyst Day comes around. Shahriar Pourreza : Okay. Terrific. Thank you, guys. Appreciate the color. Operator : We'll go next to Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Go ahead please. Nick Akins : Good morning, Steve. Steve Fleishman : Hey, good morning. Thanks. So just a question I think Julie mentioned the \u00e2\u0080\u0093 on the Kentucky sale, the write-off you took of $0.15. Is that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 should we read out is effectively reflecting your expectation of what kind of price change needs to be renegotiated for the this Mitchell issue? Is that kind of reflecting that or is that... Nick Akins : No. That one was really focused on when Liberty and AEP got together to focus on the Kentucky transaction order itself and there were requirements associated with that. So \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and we certainly were focused on making sure that that we completed that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 that order and this requirement. So that's what that is. Steve Fleishman : Okay. So I guess maybe then just on the difference between Kentucky and West Virginia and how Mitchell is treated. Could you just give a little more color on those differences and so we can kind of think about the value difference between the two? Nick Akins : Yes. So \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and I think it's pretty obvious that Kentucky had its view of valuation in 2028 and West Virginia has its view of valuation and 2028 and the two are in very different positions. And it's probably not something you're going to resolve today. So really it becomes an issue of okay, how do we get together and think about our continued operating partnership, which could be done through the operating committee of the existing operating agreements and then certainly focus on a later date to consider the risk issues associated with that. So \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and I think for us I think it's sort of a realization that there will be no doubt that Kentucky Power will continue to be a partner in Mitchell. And then when the time comes before 2028, there'll have to be some reconciliation between what Kentucky wants and what the West Virginia Commission wants. And we just want to make sure those risk parameters are taken care of on the front end. Steve Fleishman : Okay. But I guess what matters in terms of closing is really the arrangement between you and I guess Liberty in terms of Nick Akins : Yeah. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s right. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s right. Steve Fleishman : \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 closing. So is that there would be some kind of just ability to negotiate some kind of certainty on that? Nick Akins : Yeah. Because we have -- now we have an outside party involved with a third-party from AEP's perspective with Mitchell going forward. So that sort of drives a different view when everything was already owned by AEP companies. So you have to go through that process and determine okay, what's the right approach for Liberty to have that ownership and for AEP to have ownership at arm's length. Steve Fleishman : Okay. But it sounds like you're confident this will be resolved with the buyer with the property relatively soon? Nick Akins : Yeah. Yeah. Certainly, our people have been in constant contact on this issue. They're working very well together. I talked to Arun's as late as yesterday. So it's really both of us are very optimistic about this transaction. Steve Fleishman : Okay. That's good. Nick Akins : But always there was a difference there. Steve Fleishman : Yeah. I'm sure he will when it's his chance for it to do a call. And then just on the -- on transmission, just anything that you kind of expect from FERC in the second half of the year to better identify both kind of their interest in getting a lot more transmission built, but at the same time still a little bit of kind of pressure on the ROEs. And just what are you watching there? Nick Akins : Yeah. Obviously, reliability and resiliency is of central focus, not only to FERC, but the Congress as well. And I really believe they'll continue the process of all the areas of focus right now with NOPRs. They got several NOPRs out actually and they just put initiated around weatherization and making sure that we're as resilient as possible. And certainly from a transmission planning which was already done that NOPR along with they started the state process in terms of discussions relative to cost allocation those types of issues. So they're moving along. And when they issued that original NOPR under transmission, they made it clear that it wasn't going to be sequential. It's a multitasking opportunity for us to look at all these provisions. And then of course, the queues associated with the new resources and RTOs those are all being focused on. And I think FERC is doing a very credible job of marching through this and making sure that we are able to invest in transmission in a way that secures this country in so many ways. So I think that process will continue. Who knows what goes on with the ROEs, the 50 basis point adder and that kind of thing. That -- I mean that could take years to resolve. But, nevertheless, we'll continue moving forward with our investments and we'll continue to look forward to the rules, processes and procedures to be put in place where we as significant stakeholders in this process are allowed to make the investments that we need to make on a timely basis. There's no question that as we look at all the resources that are needed, the changes and the transmission system, fiber type issues that I'm sure that they'll be interested in as well in a regional activities associated with planning, ensuring that we're able to invest the way that we should on a timely basis with as little risk as possible. And that's really important because there are so many changes occurring. And for now you're seeing -- you really are seeing implications relative to resiliency and reliability. And I think everyone needs to take a pause and ensure that we're looking at that with our eyes wide open and that we're doing the right things at the right time. And that process continues. And I think FERC is doing a great job. Steve Fleishman : Great. Thank you very much. Nick Atkins : By the way most of those offers are pretty consistent with AEP's positions. So we feel really good about our role in enabling the policy to move forward. Operator : We'll go next to the line of Durgesh Chopra with Evercore. Go ahead. Nick Akins : Good morning Durgesh. Durgesh Chopra : Hey, good morning team. Quick clarification on the Kentucky sale process is my first question. Just to be clear your discussions with Liberty on the Michel operating agreement and then the FERC approval. Those are two independent processes, right? So you don't have to go back to FERC with asking for a revised approval or something like that once you settle with Liberty on as it relates to Michel? Nick Akins : Yeah. Certainly we believe with the original agreements and the ability to operate under the operating committee under that agreement, we can really focus on the status quo and ensuring that we're able to move forward with a partner that's a third party, so that the provisions of the agreement already provide for the ability to make those kinds of adjustments. So it's our belief that we do not need to go back to FERC for additional approvals. Durgesh Chopra : Got it, okay. And then just maybe wanted to get your thoughts on valuation for your renewable assets. Maybe just -- how have they evolved since the first quarter call? It's been a volatile tape. Interest rates have been up. So just any color you can share with us there, you sort of, kick start this process in September? Nick Akins : Well, obviously, we know that the headwinds of inflation and those types of things are areas of conflict with an increased valuation. But at the same time, you've got a lot of robust interest in these assets and the fact that continues to produce energy in a market that provides additional benefits for whoever winds up owning this asset. So, it's hard to tell what the valuations are going to look like right now. But I don't -- I mean certainly we're not concerned about all the macro issues that are involved because these assets stand pretty well in and out of itself and you have the positives and negatives. But now that -- and that's why we obviously took the adjustment on Flat Ridge 2, because we really wanted that out of the portfolio so that you wouldn't be arguing with bidders about what that valuation was and what the risks were of that particular project. The rest of them, or excellent projects that should bode well in the marketplace. So, like I said, I can't tell you any thoughts on what we see valuation to be. I think the market will tell us. Julie Sloat : Just to provide you a little more color if you're trying to model, aside from giving you market price point. We did include in the presentation today on slide number 44, the breakdown of all of the projects that are included in the portfolio. You'll see that we've essentially removed Flat Ridge 2 like we talked about today, as it relates to asset value and that type of thing that's on our balance sheet. If you look at our balance sheet, today our asset value associated with the portfolio as it stands is about $2.1 billion. The equity position is about $1.4 billion. We do have some projects, debt and tax equity that totaled about $272 million. So, you can plug that into your model as well. And then, we do get the question around how much did this contribute to earnings. So, for 2022 for the Generation & Marketing segment, which is $0.31 total for our guidance, kind of that midpoint about $0.13 to $0.17 relates specifically to this portfolio. So you can kind of begin to back into whatever valuation you want to assign to it. And there is a very low tax basis associated with it, but we do have some capacity to absorb a tax gain, because we've got some credits sitting on the bench that we can use to offset that. So, don't view that as problematic or seriously gating for us because it's not -- we'll be able to hurdle over that. Durgesh Chopra : Excellent. Thank you, both. Appreciate the color. Nick Akins : Sure. Operator : We'll go next to the line of Nick Campanella with Credit Suisse. Go ahead. Nick Akins : Good morning, Nick. Nick Campanella : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Nick Akins : Sure. Nick Campanella : Just a really quick follow-up on the Kentucky sale reduction. I noticed you have, like $1,400 of proceeds in the funding slides bill. So just, can you just reaffirm that are -- is everything going on in the past quarter that cash proceeds when you close to be unchanged. Julie Sloat : We're good. You're good. No worries there. So, no change in that modeling or those assumptions. We're good. Nick Campanella : Okay. Great, great. And then I guess just a question on strategy and Analyst Day. You've had some simplifying the business profile, the sale, the underwrite sales are on the horizon obviously. As we kind of think about funding this long-term CapEx plan, are you interested in pursuing further slated sales, unregulated sales, or are we kind of in the later innings of this portfolio rotation strategy? Nick Akins : Yes. I'll say, obviously, we have a lot of capital to fund and we have a great plan to do it. I would probably look at the ownership levels of the new renewables projects and that's going to provide additional opportunity for us resilience and reliability certainly distributed energy resources. All these types of things in our plans are really providing us the opportunity to fine-tune our portfolio to match what the growth expectations we have around those areas. So, no, we're not done. We will continue to evaluate opportunities to add value from a shareholder perspective, but also to ensure that our customers are seeing the capital deployment that provides a better experience. And that's something that we're very focused on. So, this just going to \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you're only seeing, really the beginning of the part of our business that is going to endure going forward, as we transition this company. And that process will certainly continue. That's why I sort of said, it's a continued execution around, and I use taking care of business, but adding a dash of let's go crazy that sort of says we're going to be thinking on the edge about what can be done to make sure that we fund these real opportunities we have ahead of us. Nick Campanella : All right. Thank you very much. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll look to you in October. Thanks. Nick Akins : Yeah. Operator : And for our next question we'll go to the line of Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Nick Akins : Good morning, Steve. Dave Arcaro : Hi. It's Dave Arcaro on for Stephen. Thanks so much for taking our questions. Nick Akins : Okay. Yeah. Hey, Dave. Dave Arcaro : Wondering \u00e2\u0080\u0093 hey, how are you doing? Wondering if you could give your latest expectations around federal climate policy here? Do you expect renewable tax credits to be in an extenders bill potentially towards the end of the year? And just generally anything you would expect in terms of deal climate legislation this year? Nick Akins : Yeah. I think, it certainly it's going to be a challenge. And I think I said that, last quarter, it is going to be a challenge. And the way it appears to be coming together is there were some \u00e2\u0080\u0093 there are some discussions going on. There may still be discussions going on. But right now, they're so focused on the healthcare pharmaceutical activities that may be bifurcated. And then \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and certainly the Chips Act now, we're obviously for the Chips Act, because Intel is locating within our territory with two fabs, up to eight fabs, and that's a huge, huge positive. So you have things like that that are going on now not only that, but obviously the midterms are providing some overhang to getting even a smaller package done, although there has been discussions of working on that and trying to get something done by September 30. But even that is going to be a really hard thing to do. So again, I would say, post election you're probably dealing with either some form of a smaller package, or extenders which that's a typical thing that happens toward the end of the year, when ITCs, PTCs start to roll off, again, you'll see extenders or the IRS of supply chain activities being able to extend it for some period of time. You'll probably see some Band-Aid solutions until you see solid solution going forward. So I just think the environment is certainly very volatile right now, and it will take time to work itself out. And maybe even post election, again, you'll maybe have some sense of calmness to be able to focus in on some of these things that are important, because our industry. And by the way, our 16,000 megawatts does not include any extension of ITCs, PTCs. But we are definitely for those extensions and expansions to nuclear and as well to storage. Those are clear opportunities for us to redefine the resource plans going forward. Direct Pay is also very important us, but we -- that would make -- at least at this point, as a test sale, maybe later on we can convince everybody that that truly is a benefit to our customers. So anything we get from that perspective will ultimately be a benefit to our customers from an economic standpoint and that will be good for, not only our movement to a clean energy economy, but the options that we have available to us, namely with storage, nuclear, hydrogen hubs, those kinds of things need to continue to be looked at to make sure we're resilient and reliable going forward. So that's where we stand right now, I think. Dave Arcaro : Got it. Thanks. That's helpful color. Maybe, just one just small follow-up. I was just wondering, at Flat Ridge, if the issues that you found there? Is that just an exclusive to that project? It didn't have any other -- or none of the other assets in the portfolio had similar issues as\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Nick Akins : That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s right. Dave Arcaro :  -- going on at Flat Ridge and that was the only one you plan to extract. Nick Akins : That's right. That's why we separated that one. Yes. The others are good. Dave Arcaro : Understood. Okay, great. Thanks so much. Operator : Okay. We will go next to the line of Andrew Weisel with Scotiabank. Go ahead, please. Nick Akins : Good morning, Andrew. Andrew Weisel : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Just one for me about coal. So between reliability concerns in the Supreme Court ruling that you mentioned, do you see any potential -- some coal plants online beyond their current schedule dates, beyond Mitchell, which is a bit of a unique situation. But would you consider extending them? And if so, would they be potential back up as peakers went, or keep some as either intermediate or baseload resources. Nick Akins : Well, I think, that's exactly why, certainly, we said a rational and reasonable approach to moving forward from a resource perspective. We have to be able to maintain reliability, resiliency and economics for the grid and to our customers. And certainly, for our units, we continue to progress along the path that we've already placed in line. And actually, you have to do that to be able to define the future. And we're very, very focused on the just transitional aspects of our communities as we make any transition. So you touched on a point that's particularly important, for resiliency and reliability reasons, the capacity provided by these units is extremely important. And whether the capacity factors move down, as you bring in and layer in more renewable energy and clean energy, that's fine, as long as you have the resource to be able to meet the demands. And then, eventually, we have to find a path that ensures the communities continue to thrive from a tax standpoint, fire protection, police protection, school boards, all that kind of stuff. We have to be able to look at that. We can't just shut down these communities and then decide something else. So in areas like West Virginia with the coal-fired generation, we have to define what that path is. It may be small modular reactors, if we can define what that risk is and limit it from a shareholder perspective. Certainly, DOE is very interested in that. And it just so happens, the jobs of a small modular reactor is the same as a coal plant and paying the same taxes and those types of things that's an opportunity to take a look at whether it's hydrogen hubs or storage or other activities. So we've got to be able to rationalize that. But coal has provided an important benefit in coal generation particularly during these summer months. And obviously, during the winter months as well and we've got to be mindful of how that process continues. So that's why we have to say it has to be rational reasonable and with the time frame that makes sense. Andrew Weisel : Thanks. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very helpful. Nick Akins : Yes. Operator : We'll go next to the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Go ahead. Michael Lapides : Good morning. Nick I know you're excited about the Analyst Day even you're probably equally as excited as having Brian Kelly down in Baton Rouge. Nick Akins : Yes. Michael Lapides : I'm looking at the earned ROE versus authorized pivot. Just have a couple of questions about few of the subs. How are you thinking about what structural changes in rate making. Your team is going to seek in the next couple of years in a few of the jurisdictions that are earning a good bit below that. We think in PSO, we're honestly you fought under-earning for a number of years, but also thinking a little bit on APCo, a little bit on SWEPCO. Nick Akins : Yes. So, obviously, there's been substantial opportunities there in those regions of the country, because actually when we put in renewables, the renewables is helping from an ROE perspective. So -- and obviously from -- as it reduces rates to customers from a fuel standpoint and overall in the savings gives us an opportunity to deploy capital investment in those areas. Sometimes obviously, we'll spend capital to make sure that we're doing those things to ensure resilience liability and all those activities. But particularly, from an ROE perspective, a ratemaking standpoint, equity layers has certainly been a big push of ours and certainly from a concurrent recovery standpoint with formula-based rates we have forward-looking rates in Indiana and Michigan. We like to see that in other jurisdictions with the massive amounts of capital that we're deploying. And then typically the renewables are tracked as part of the investment until we get it in rate base and that's worked out great for us. I think -- and you're also seeing opportunities for us to really get out ahead with the commissions on what we're trying to achieve in terms of not only benefits to our customers, but also the ability for our customers to use our product. I mean, I look at on the customer side with distributed energy resources with the analytics and all the equipment that can be put in place to enable customers to make wise judgments would be highly beneficial not just for the operations of the grid, but also to mitigate their own fuel costs and bills during periods of time and obviate the need for the securitization or other things that we have to do in huge storm-related environments. So, I think there's a lot of good things going on. And the trackers, I think, it's 85% of our recovery is tracker base. So we'd like to improve on that as well. I think there has to be a recognition that cash coming into the utility is particularly important and we always talk about FFO to debt and the utilities with all the massive investments necessary. We need to be able to see the cash coming in the door so that we can continue to make those kinds of investments. So that's going to be huge message for our regulators going forward as well. But we're doing good things. And as long as we're doing good things and spending on the right things, we believe we're aligned with our commissions and our customers on the right path forward and we feel very good about the path that we're on. Julie Sloat : Michael, maybe a little more help there too on PSO in particular. We've got securitization that we'll be completing here next month. So in August for the storm Yuri cost, so that should help to alleviate some of this pressure as well. And we'll be filing another base case. So stay tuned for that as well. And as Nick mentioned, just some refinement around utilization of different rate adjustment clauses, et cetera, not only in West Virginia, Virginia but then also as we take a look at SWEPCO, we still have the outstanding component that's not included in rates. So we've got different ways to get after it and you'll see us talk more about that as we come at you here on October 4. So stay tuned. Michael Lapides : That's great. And one quickly final up. Just Cardinal on the G&M segment had a big benefit during the quarter, just given where power prices were versus your delivered cost of coal. Can you remind us how you're thinking about the future for Cardinal going forward? Nick Akins : Yes. So Cardinal, you're talking about the Cardinal plant. Yes. So\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Michael Lapides : Yes. Nick Akins : So \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we plan on completing a transaction with Buckeye related to that particular plant. So they would take ownership of the plant and we would take a PPA back for a certain period. So \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and then that means we will not have any generation to speak of left in Ohio on the unregulated side. So \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and that it's a long way from where we were in Ohio. But I think it's also there's a message for Ohio in terms of generation that needs to be placed in this state. So that's probably another issue I can get into it but I'll stop there. But I think that's all in the plans already. Julie Sloat : Yes Michael. So that PPA with Cardinal goes I think through 2028 to give you a endpoint on that as well. Michael Lapides : Got it. Thank you, guys. Thanks, Nick. Thanks, Julie. Much appreciate it. Nick Akins : Sure. Thanks. Talk to your later. Operator : We'll go to the line of Sophie Karp with KeyBanc. Go ahead. Nick Akins : Good morning, Sophie. Sophie Karp : Hi. Good morning. Thank you for squeezing me in. We have a lot has been discussed already, but if I may just ask a couple of questions. First on transmission. So you made a point of saying that transmission Transco remains one of your I guess key growth engines. So I don't want to miss quality base. But \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and also at the same time you're talking about not being done with divestitures of something it's a non-core business. Can you maybe help us frame how you think about transmission? Is it \u00e2\u0080\u0093 are you making these comments because you're getting questions about potential transmission sale? And how are you thinking about that, or should we not read too much in this. Nick Akins : No I don't read too much into it because transmission is a key component for our not only for our investment in the company but also in terms of what we see relative to the transition to the future. Transmission is a key component for resiliency, reliability and optimization, as we move to a clean energy environment. So, no, we're -- from a transmission standpoint, we feel very good about our role relative to transmission. And actually, I see distribution continuing to grow and certainly the renewables transformation itself. So, no, don't read anything into that. Sophie Karp : All right. Thank you for clarifying that. And then my second question was a little bit of a housekeeping question I guess. I'm looking at the -- related to new growth opportunity exhibit at slide 40. And it seems like for APCo, when the opportunity has been reduced a little bit and solar increase a little bit in the 2020 to 2030 time frame. I'm just kind of wondering, if that's just some project realignment, or should we be -- how should we be thinking about this? Nick Akins : Yes. So the April integrated resource plan, certainly showed what was needed from an APCo perspective. So -- and I think there's probably more to come on that, but it's actually immaterial at this point. Sophie Karp : All right. Thank you. Operator : And speakers' we have no further lines in queue at this time. Darcy Reese : Thank you for joining us on today's call. As always, the IR team will be available to answer any additional questions you may have. Alan, would you please give the replay information? Operator : Yes, I will.

At this time all participants are in listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question and answer session. [Operator Instructions]. And as a reminder, your conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to you host Vice President of Investor Relations Darcy Reese. Please go ahead. Darcy Reese : Thank you, Louis. Good morning, everyone and welcome to the third quarter 2022 earnings call for American Electric Power. We appreciate you taking the time to join us today. Our earnings release presentation slides and related financial information are available on our website at aep.com. Today we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors.   Joining me this morning for opening remarks are Nick Akins, our Chair, and Chief Executive Officer; and Julie Sloat, our President Chief Financial Officer. We will take your questions following their remarks.   I will now turn the call over to Nick. Nick Akins : Okay, thanks, Darcy. Welcome everyone to American Electric Powers third quarter 2022 earnings call. We continue to make significant progress on our commitments, we have leveraged our scale, our financial strength, portfolio management and transition to a pure play regulated utility. Over the past 10 years, we've had a great record of consistently exceeding our earnings projections and raising guidance, with this quarter being no exception. Today I'll provide a brief recap of the key financial highlights for the quarter, followed by updates on our Kentucky sale process, our unregulated contracted renewables portfolio sale, and the previously announced strategic review of our retail business, all of which are part of our strategy to simplify and derisk our business profile.  I will then spend time discussing our carbon emission reduction goals, in addition to our continued emphasis on regulated renewables execution, and generation fleet transformation. I'll conclude by providing insights into our other ongoing regulatory activities.  All of this summarized information can be found on slide six and seven of today's presentation with supporting details in the appendix. So, after the financials, we continue to build on our momentum delivering strong third quarter 2022, operating earnings $1.62 per share or $831 million.  Today, we are reaffirming our 2022 narrowed full year operating guidance range, as well as our newly introduced 2023 operating earnings guidance range, both of which we had announced at our recent Analyst Day.  As a reminder, we are going -- are guiding to a 2022 range of $4.97 to $5.07, with an increased midpoint of $5.02 per share, and our 2023 guidance range is $5.19 to $5.31, with a $5.29 per share midpoint. Our long term earnings growth rate guidance of 6% to 7% is underpinned by a robust $40 billion capital investment plan for 2023 to 2027, which includes $26 billion in wires and $9 billion in regulated renewables investments.  Moreover, our dividend growth is in line with our long-term growth rate and within our targeted payout ratio of 60% to 70%. We continue to derisk our platform and execute our strategy to ensure that we are best positioned for value creation in the face of global economic uncertainty and inflationary pressures. As part of this effort, we are continuing to work with states to drive reliability and resiliency in our service territory amidst customer bill considerations and other macroeconomic factors. In order to lessen the impact on our capital investment plan, we have also diversified our mix of suppliers, which has minimized customer and business supply chain disruptions to date. Later in today's call, Julie will walk through our third quarter performance drivers and share thoughts on the positive load outlook in our service territory as well as on our targeted 14% to 15% FFO to debt range. So now talking about some of the strategic reviews. True to our steadfast commitment to execution, we're in the final stretch to complete the sale of our Kentucky operations celebrity. As we previously mentioned, FERC told their approval date to December 16, and we have, therefore, signed with Liberty to plan for a January 2023 closing date. This date is keyed off of FERC's process and should give confidence to all stakeholders, including employees, customers, communities and shareholders. It also enables our transition teams to adequately and efficiently plan for the closing. While our sale time line has shifted over the past year, we are not revising our earnings guidance or any of our equity needs. We are pleased to reach this point and are confident in our ability to close the transaction shortly after the start of the new year. Related to our unregulated contracted renewals portfolio, we launched the sale process for this 1,365 megawatt portfolio in late August 2022 with strong buyer interest from both financial and strategic investors. We recently accepted bids for Phase 1 of the auction process and are proceeding into Phase II due diligence with selected bidders. We are on pace for closing for a closing date in the second quarter of 2023. Selling the portfolio will allow AEP to shift focus and rotate capital towards regulated businesses as we continue to transform our generation fleet and enhance transmission infrastructure. As we announced earlier this month on our Analyst Day, we are pursuing a strategic review of our retail business as we adjust to how our interest in the competitive markets has changed over time. We'll keep you updated on our progress and expect to complete our review in the first half of 2023. We're always considering opportunities to enhance shareholder value, and we'll continue to evaluate potential value-additive opportunities for our regulated businesses against the backdrop of our goal to further simplify and derisk the business. Now regarding emission reduction goals, as we mentioned in the Analyst Day, AEP remains firmly grounded in our principles of resiliency, reliability and affordability, while recognizing the value of our diverse resource portfolio given today's world of energy-related volatility. We are undertaking one of the largest clean energy transformations in the country through our regulated renewable strategy, and we announced our enhanced and accelerated carbon emission reduction goals at our Analyst Day in early October, as I mentioned earlier. First, we have rebased our near-term emission reduction target of 80% by 2030 now pegged to a 2005 baseline instead of 2000. Second, we upgraded our near-term reduction target. And as such, all Scope one emissions are now included in our carbon emission reduction goals.  Lastly, we accelerated our net zero goal by five years from 2050 to 2045. We are confident in our path forward and our ability to hit key milestones in a steady and timely manner. Importantly, these goals are aligned and supported by our latest integrated resource lands that are in the various states. We will continue our planned retirement and disposition of select fossil fuel units while adding renewables to our generation portfolio. Our 1.5-gigawatt North Central wind portfolio, which became fully operational in March of this year, represents only the beginning of our clean energy fleet transition. In addition, we have 17-gigawatts of potential generation additions across different resource types within our vertically-integrated utilities over the next 10 years. Combined, this represents 18.5-gigawatts of new generation, which will significantly contribute to AEP's reduced carbon emissions profile and put us on a path to achieve net zero -- our net zero goal by 2045. As an update, on October 19, related to SWEPCO's 999-megawatt renewables totaling $2.2 billion of investment, the Arkansas staff filed support of these resources subject to conditions. Commission orders are expected in 2023. As we look to the long term, we are committed to building a reliable and resilient grid to efficiently deliver clean energy to our customers, and we will continue to monitor new technologies that can help us close the gap to net zero, while maintaining the highly reliable and affordable delivery of energy that our customers expect. Moreover, newly passed provisions and the Inflation Reduction Act, which is foundational to our clean energy investment strategy should help bolster advancement of new carbon-free energy sources. The bill includes tax credits for technologies like clean hydrogen projection -- production and energy storage, in addition to the technology neutral tax credits for our carbon-free resources and we will continue to evaluate these resources through our integrated resource plans. With regard to our ongoing regulatory activities, our regulated ROE as of September 30, 2022, is 9.3% and continues to improve as we work through regulatory cases and continue to make strides in reducing our authorized versus actual ROE gap. In fact, as an update on SWEPCO on September 29, we filed notice to move the 88 megawatts of Turk Plant into rates in Arkansas. The full filing will occur within the November, December time frame, and we will seek a rider to place the 88-megawatt capacity in rates. With respect to our outstanding SWEPCO Louisiana rate case, we are expecting an order in the fourth quarter of 2022. We've also made notable progress on APCo's 2020 Virginia case. As many of you likely recall, we successfully appeal the triennial rate order the day following the issuance of the order in November 2020, giving confidence in our position that the order was inconsistent with Virginia statute. We are pleased that the court recently ruled in AEP's favor preserving our right to seek a retroactive adjustment in addition to the ongoing rate adjustment. Interim rates were implemented in Virginia on October First of this year. We've also actively managed the implications of increased fuel costs as we focus on maintaining a balance between cost recovery and customer impacts.  As part of this effort, our operating companies continue to work with commissions, regulators and other stakeholders to educate customers about surges and put mechanisms in place to alleviate these pressures. For example, we have 6-month and 2-month clauses in I&M and SWEPCO Louisiana respectively, to help ease the effect of longer-term fuel classes. We also -- we were also able to lengthen the months of fuel recovery in Virginia and Oklahoma and are working with our customers and commissions to make sure we recover that over a longer period of time. As you all know, this will be my last earnings call as I will be transitioning from CEO to Executive Chair on January 1, and Julie will become CEO of AEP. We're very excited to have an executive of Julie's caliber to lead our company. I'm confident in her deep knowledge of AEP as well as the emphasis she places on consistency, quality of earnings and dividends and shareholder and customer value creation that will be instrumental to AEP's continued success. I'm also confident that she has the heart to be a strong leader. I'm reminded of the lyrics of Rush\u2019s Closer to the Heart that I have always related to as a CEO, and it goes something like this. And the men and women who hold high places must be the ones who start to mold a new reality closer to the heart. The role of a CEO in the company, our communities and our country has changed during my tenure, Julie is the embodiment of the new CEO and will lead this company to even greater success. After 44 earnings call, my tenure will soon come to an end as CEO of this great company. So, I'll end this call with lyrics from a great Led Zeppelin song. And so today, my world at smiles. And song title is Merely Thank You. Julie? Julie Sloat : Oh, my goodness, Nick. Thank you. Thank you. Well, yes, all heart and all in. Absolutely, absolutely. So, thanks, everyone, for joining us today. I know you have a real busy morning with multiple companies reporting. So, we'll try to be as efficient as possible. But I'm going to walk us through the third quarter year-to-date results, share some updates on our service territory load and economy and finish with commentary on credit metrics and liquidity, as well as some thoughts on our guidance, financial targets and recap our commitments to stakeholders. So, I'm going to start on Slide eight which shows the comparison of GAAP to operating earnings. GAAP earnings for the third quarter were $1.33 per share compared to $1.59 per share in 2021. GAAP earnings through September were $3.76 per share compared to $3.90 per share in 2021. For the quarter, I'd like to mention two reconciling items. First, there's a write-off of a Virginia regulatory asset associated with previously closed coal plants. This is a result of the Virginia Supreme Court opinion that affirmed the company's original write-down of those plants in 2019 and allowed APCo to increase its Virginia rates on a going-forward basis. The other reconciling item that I'd like to mention related to the sale of Kentucky Power. You'll recall that we announced on September 30, that we'd entered into an amendment to the stock purchase agreement with Liberty that among other items resulted in a reduced purchase price. We've reflected the additional loss on the expected sale of Kentucky Power and Kentucky Transco as a non-operating cost. There's a detailed reconciliation of GAAP to operating earnings on Pages 16 and 17 of the presentation today. Let's walk through our quarterly operating earnings performance by segment on Slide nine. Operating earnings for the third quarter totaled $1.62 per share compared to $1.43 per share in 2021.  Operating earnings for the vertically-integrated utilities were $0.97 per share, up $0.10. Favorable drivers included rate changes across multiple jurisdictions, the impact of the Virginia Supreme Court ruling related to our APCo triennial review, which you'll see on the waterfall today is a $0.06 catch-up of the 2017 through 2019 under earnings, positive weather on our Western jurisdictions and increased transmission revenue. These items were somewhat offset by an increase in depreciation lower normalized load and increased income taxes. Just as a reminder on O&M and depreciation, as I mentioned on last quarter's call that included in our 2022 guidance details, we have a change in accounting related to the Rockport Unit 2 lease at I&M. We're seeing approximately $0.05 of favorable O&M offset by $0.05 of unfavorable depreciation in each quarter of 2022, but no consequential earnings impact. I'll talk a little bit more on load performance, but I'll get to that here in a minute. So, bear with me. The Transmission and Distribution Utilities segment earned $0.32 per share, up $0.01 compared to last year. Favorable drivers in this segment include rate changes and positive weather in Texas and Ohio and increased transmission revenue.  Offsetting these favorable items were unfavorable O&M depreciation and income taxes. The AEP transmission Holdco segment contributed $0.33 per share flat compared to last year, favorable investment growth of $0.2 was somewhat offset by unfavorable income taxes. Generation and marketing produced $0.14 per share up $0.10 from last year. The positive variance is primarily due to higher retail margins, increased renewable wind production, higher market prices impacting generation margins and favorable income taxes. Finally, Corporate and Other was down $0.02 per share driven by unfavorable interest expense, mainly as a result of the increase in short-term debt rates and increased O&M partially offset by reduced investment losses. The reduced investment losses are largely related to charge point losses that we had in the third quarter of 2021, that have reversed this year. I'll note that we exited our position in charge point during the third quarter so a side from the year-over-year comparison, we will not have any new volatility in this particular aspect of corporate and the -- corporate and other segment relating to our direct ownership of charge point shares since the position has been liquidated. So, let's go to Slide 10, and I'll talk about our year-to-date operating earnings performance. Year-to-date operating earnings total to $4.04 per share compared to $3.76 per share in 2021. Operating earnings for vertically integrated utilities were $2.15 per share, up $0.28. Similar to the quarter, favorable drivers included rate changes across multiple jurisdictions, the resolution of the APCo triennial, positive weather in our western jurisdictions, increased transmission revenue and favorable normalized retail load. These items were somewhat offset by increased depreciation and lower off-system sales. Once again, the change in accounting around the Rockport Unit two lease results in $0.17 of favorable O&M offset by $0.17 of unfavorable depreciation.  The Transmission and Distribution Utilities segment earned $0.95 per share, up $0.10 compared to last year. Favorable drivers in this segment included rate changes in Texas and Ohio, favorable weather and increased normalized retail load and transmission revenue. Offsetting these favorable items were unfavorable O&M, property taxes and depreciation. The AEP Transmission Holdco segment contributed $0.95 per share, down $0.07 per share compared to last year. Favorable investment growth of $0. 06 was more than offset by an unfavorable true-up of $0.07 and increased income taxes. As I mentioned last quarter, this is entirely consistent with our guidance. Our 2022 guidance had this segment down by $0.08 year-over-year as a result of the investment growth being more than offset by the annual true-up that occurred last quarter and some unfavorable comparisons on the tax and financing side. Generation and Marketing produced $0.34 per share, up $0.14 from last year. The positive variance is primarily due to the sale of renewable development sites improved retail margins, increased wholesale margins and land sales in the depreciate generation segment. Finally, Corporate and other was down $0.17 per share, driven by lower investment gains, unfavorable interest and increased O&M. The lower investment gains are largely related to charge point gains that we had in 2021 that reversed this year. Turning to Slide 11. Let me provide an update on our normalized load performance for the quarter. Overall, AEP service territory has maintained significant momentum through the first three quarters of the year despite increasing headwinds impacting the macro economy. Starting in the lower right corner, normalized retail sales increased by 2.6% in the third quarter compared to last year. Once again, every operating company experienced positive year-over-year growth for the quarter. Furthermore, the growth in the commercial and industrial sales this quarter more than offset the modest decline in residential sales. For the year-to-date comparison, AEP's normalized retail sales increased by 3.1%, with growth spread across all major retail classes and operating companies. In fact, we're on pace to experience the strongest year for load growth since the mid-1990s. And that's on top of the recovery year we had last year when the load increased by 2.1%. Moving to the upper left corner, normalized residential sales decreased by 0.8% in the third quarter but remained up 0.3% through September compared to last year. For the quarter, residential accounts increased by 0.4%, but this was offset by a 1.2% decline in weather-normalized usage. This is not surprising when you consider that last year, many of our customers were receiving extra income from the fiscal stimulus that is not happening in 2022. While the results were mixed by operating company, the strongest residential growth for the quarter was at SWEPCO. Moving right, weather normalized commercial sales increased by 3.4% for the quarter and were up 3.8% for the year-to-date comparison. The growth in commercial sales was spread across nearly every operating company and eight of our top 10 commercial sectors. The fastest-growing commercial sector is data centers, where loads up 33% compared to last year for the quarter and for the year-to-date comparisons. Finally, focusing on the lower left corner, you'll see that the industrial sales posted another strong quarter, up 6% for the quarter and up 5.5% for the year-to-date comparison to last year. Industrial sales were up at nearly every operating company in most of our largest sectors. We continue to experience double-digit growth in a number of key industries this quarter, including chemicals, manufacturing and oil and gas extraction. We also saw robust growth in primary metals manufacturing, pipeline transportation, paper manufacturing and coal mining. To summarize, the AEP service territory has maintained significant momentum through the first nine months of the year despite the challenging headwinds of inflation, higher interest rates, supply chain disruptions and the labor shortage.  We know the Federal Reserve's approach to address inflation is designed to slow down the economy, which will eventually work its way through our footprint. However, I'd like to remind you that there are things that we've done and will continue to do to help mitigate the impact of slowing economic conditions in our service territory specifically, we're talking about our economic development efforts.  So, turning to Slide 12, I want to highlight how our commitment to economic development is helping to sustain load growth even in the face of challenging economic conditions. The chart on this slide illustrates why this strategy is so important to us. The blue bars on this chart show the growth in gross regional product or GRP, for the AEP service territory over the past year. So, you can see that it has been slowing over the period. In fact, for the third quarter, growth in AEP's GRP was essentially flat. However, the green bars here show that our industrial sales growth over the same period, you'll notice that they've maintained their strength, even improving 6% without the help from GRP. How does this happen? That's because of our consistent and disciplined approach to economic development over the years. A lot of the growth in industrial load that we're seeing today is a consequence of economic development projects from previous years that are coming online this year.  Examples include a large steel plant and an LNG processing facility that are now online in the AEP Texas service territory, a new chemicals plant that is now operating in Tennessee or a paper plant that is now producing in Oklahoma. And these are just a few of the many examples that we could mention. But the key takeaway here is that AEP's commitment to economic development is what is allowing us to be on track to post our strongest year for load growth in decades despite an economy that is beginning to slow down. Another key point to remember is that you cannot turn it on or off like a light switch. Economic development projects take time to materialize, and the results that we see here today are largely the result of activities that occurred years ago. By making this a key component of our strategy, AEP is helping to mitigate the impact of economic downturns on our customers, our communities and our investors. And AEP's economic development team has a proven track record of helping bring these new customers to our service territory with an emphasis on jobs and load. In fact, the AEP service territory has added over 106,000 jobs this year. So, let's move down to Slide 13, to discuss the company's capitalization and liquidity position. We're doing well in this regard. On a GAAP basis, our debt-to-capital ratio held constant from the prior quarter at 61.4%. Taking a look at the left upper quadrant on this page, you'll see our FFO to debt metric stands at 14.5% on both the Moody's and a GAAP basis, which is an increase of 1.1% and 1.2%, respectively, the prior quarter. The primary reason for the increase is attributed to the completion of the PSO securitization efforts, which increased cash from operations. As we stated on our last earnings call, we anticipated trending toward our FFO debt targeted range of 14% to 15% as the year progressed, and we currently sit comfortably within that range. You can see our liquidity summer in the lower left quadrant on the slide, our 5-year $4 billion bank revolver and our 2-year $1 billion revolving credit facility to support our liquidity position, which remains strong at $3.6 billion. On the qualified pension front, while our funding status decreased 0.3% during the quarter, it remains comfortably strong at 105.3%. Negative returns on the risk seeking and fixed income assets during the quarter were primary drivers of the funded status decrease. However, rising interest rates cause plan liability to decrease, which provided a favorable offset to the negative asset returns. So, we're in a good place in terms of funding. Let's go to Slide 14, So I can do a quick recap of today's message. The third quarter continues to provide a solid foundation for the rest of 2022 and allowed us -- at our recent Analyst Day, in narrow and raise our operating earnings guidance range to $4.97 to $5.07 with a midpoint of $5.02. As you know, AEP offers steady and predictable growth driven by our low-risk regulated business, robust electric infrastructure investment pipeline and our proven track record of managing cost pressures over time while growing our rate base. This, along with the updated 2022 load forecast we provided at our October 4 Analyst Day and the Virginia Supreme Court ruling related to APCo's 2017 to 2019 triennial review, position us to navigate headwinds, remaining this year that you would expect, such as continued inflation, interest rates, weather risks, et cetera, which is why we maintained a $0.10 range when we recently lifted and tightened our 2022 guidance range. We continue to be committed to our long-term growth rate of 6% to 7%, continued dividend growth and a strong balance sheet while we are delisting the company, focusing on the customer and actively managing the portfolio. So, we really do appreciate your time and attention today and I know you guys are super busy with the all the earnings calls. So, with that, I'm going to kick it over to the operator, so we can hear what's on your mind and take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Jeremy Tonet : Good morning. I just wanted to pick up on one of the key themes at the Analyst Day talking about the transmission within AEP and the significant growth potential there as you see it and what appears to be a valuation disconnect with AEP stock relative to public comps and transactions. I'm just wondering if that conversation invited any reverse inquiries on your assets? I know you said these are core to you, but just kind of curious how that's developed and any other thoughts on that side you might share? Nick Akins : Yes, I'll just follow up with the -- did I mention transmission. So I'll turn it over to Julie, who respond to that. Julie Sloat : Thank you, Nick. Thanks, Jeremy. Thanks for the question. Let me tell you, we've certainly got a lot of attention from our investor base. And so I'll answer it that way. So we appreciate that because that means we're doing our jobs. I think we still need to do a lot of work here to make sure that we make it easy for you all to understand what the earnings stream is in the earnings potential of that particular business. And so as we were getting ready for this call today, I'm looking at the waterfalls on Pages 9 and 10 of the presentation today. And so let me go to Page 10 just for real quickly. So the AEP Transmission Holdco, which is our pure play transmission component contributed $0.95 of the $4.04 year-to-date. And as you know, we've got more transmission and play across this waterfall too, that shows up in the vertically integrated utilities in the T&D segment. So as a swag and we'll do better with this as we go into 2023 to give you a more granular view of the transmission component in the aggregate from AEP, but assume that roughly 50% of the earnings on the vertically integrated utilities and T&D utilities is essentially the part of the 95% -- or I'm sorry, adding $0.95 to another -- let me say it in another way, I'm totally tripping over myself here. $0.95 from the AEP Transmission Holdco, essentially double that. So that's about half. So half of our earnings are coming from that particular segment. The other half is coming from vertically integrated utilities and in T&D utilities. So not insignificant when you compare that just under $2 to the 404. So we'll do better, and I'll do better explain in the stuff as we go forward in 2023, but I wanted to have that number kind of in the back of my pocket here in case you asked the question, so I'm glad you did. Nick Akins : But the overarching theme around transmission is that with -- certainly with the movement to clean energy economy, and the focus we have on renewables being put in place, you can't put these renewables in place without additional transmission, transmission, is becoming more constrained. So it turns out to be very positive from an AEP perspective from an opportunities to really focus on not only the development of transmission, which were the largest in the country but also in terms of the renewables build-out and in fact, distribution with distributed energy resources that will drive different resource needs as well. So all in good shape from that perspective. So we feel very, very bullish about our transmission. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. That's helpful. And then just shifting gears a little bit. Rates moving up here. And so just wondering what you can say about that with regard to short-term rate moving higher and long-term debt issuance as being more expensive, just think about historic test years and lag in jurisdictions, wondering what could be done or how do you see that unfolding? Nick Akins : Yes, Julie. Julie Sloat : Yes. No, thanks again for the question. We're keeping a watchful eye on that. You're absolutely right. So let me kind of compare and contrast. The short-term debt rate that we were realizing last year through the first 9 months was about 27 basis points. Today, through the first 9 months, that was about 1.46%. So a significant uptick. And so what we'll be doing is continuing to manage across the different buckets of tenor and using kind of barbell strategies to do our financings going forward. We still have a little bit of work we have yet to do this year, and that's at the parent. I mentioned that at our Analyst Day back on October 4. And we're assuming that rates would adjust to on a longer-term basis to about 5% to 6% for us. That compares to through the year-to-date rate of about 3.34%. We will and do have that embedded in our 2023 guidance, but we'll continue to work with that.  Let me give you another finer point to that what I pay attention to is how much of our debt is floating rate. We generally target somewhere between 15% and 20% of our total portfolio being floating rate. As of the end of the third quarter, we were at about 14.8%. About -- that equates to about the parent about $5. 7 billion, $1.95 billion of that being CP. So we've got a fair amount of fluctuation there, but that's already getting picked up in rates, and it's absolutely embedded in 2023 guidance. We'll have more for you to share and for your modeling efforts at the EEI conference when you get all the assumptions that we'll have behind the waterfall and details that you're typically used to seeing from us. Operator : And the next question will come from the line of Durgesh Chopra -- I'm sorry, from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Durgesh Chopra : Good morning. Congrats on a solid quarter here. I have two questions. The first one -- just maybe can you elaborate to the extent you can, you mentioned Phase 1 of the unregulated renewable sale. Just who are the interested parties here are the strategics are these privates? Or any -- any additional color you can share there? Nick Akins : I would certainly say that the list was robust. And all the usual suspects that you would think of and beyond. But there were a lot. And I'd say it was still generally half and half, 60-40, whatever it was of strategics and others financials. And so -- and actually, the Phase 2, we're going into a list with strategics and financials and it's a well-balanced group. One that I'm sure will hold each other accountable during the process, but we're very happy with the responses we received. Durgesh Chopra : Excellent. It sounds like you're making very good progress there. Nick Akins : Yes. They'll go into the confidential rooms and all that kind of stuff and more due diligence will be done, and we'll go through the process with them. So that's just what the process is. Julie Sloat : And Durgesh, this is Julie. We have a 2-step bid process, and we would expect to be in a position to have a PSA signed in early 2023. With the closing in the first half of next year. I think we shared that with you on October 4. And we get the question around who is the primary regulatory authority or body that will govern this, and that's FERC, as you know. Durgesh Chopra : Got it. And then maybe just to pivot on to the second subpoena from SEC. Just how to read into that? What are the implications for you? I mean, does this increase the risk sort of potential? Nick Akins : Yes. We view it as a continuing part of the process. And we said we would be transparent and we have been transparent and we'll continue to work in a positive fashion with the SEC during their investigation. And certainly, the issuance of a second subpoena is really -- they just need more information. So -- and we're going to supply it. So we're going to work with them and we'll continue doing so. So our response is essentially the same as the first one. We recognize there were governance issues we need to change relative to 501(c)4 and we made those changes. And certainly, from our perspective, we'll continue to work with them to get this thing resolved. Operator : The next question is from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Good morning. Congrats, Nick, Absolutely. If I can pivot still on this -- if I can continue with the last question a little bit and can ask again about this second subpoena. Just what's your understanding of the process from here on out? Again, I get that they continue to inquire here. Just -- can you elaborate a little bit further here? Again, obviously, you're complying, you're submitting documentation, but just a little bit of the sense of what you get from here out. Nick Akins : I mean there's not much else we can say about it, obviously, because it is a process with the SEC, and it's really up to the SEC what -- how they want to continue to analyze the information, ask for new information. And typically, I guess, whenever they need new information, they'll issue new subpoena. So it's just part of the process, and it's really up to the SEC. And our only -- I mean the only control we have is to continue to cooperate very positively and respond, and we'll continue to do that. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent. Okay, perfect. And then if I can, just with respect to West Virginia, can you guys talk a little bit about the fuel situation there? I mean is there an ability to leverage securitization here to address the balance there? And just to what extent can that sort of fully address that balance? Nick Akins : Yes, Julie? Julie Sloat : Yes. No. Thanks for the question, Julien. And actually, as a matter of fact, that's exactly what we're contemplating. As you know, we've got a fair amount of exposure in excess of $400 million as of the end of the third quarter. of deferred fuel at West Virginia, in particular, we want to be very sensitive to customer bills. So the plan is to see what we can do around securitization of the outstanding balance and manage rates for customers. Right now, the current mechanism is we have a 12-month fuel cause to reset and account for the prior year. We're currently in hearing there, but we want to be extremely sensitive to our customer base as it relates to that particular area. So standby, we'll have more to tell you and more to share as we make some progress, but securitization is absolutely contemplated. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it right. So there's no qualification issues or needing to get clarification on legislation, right, that it should be directly applicable. Nick Akins : That's right. Julie Sloat : Yes. But we do need some clarification on the legislation because it's very specific to what you're trying to securitize. So that will be a critical path for us. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Okay. So we should look for that next in terms of getting this done? Julie Sloat : Yes, yes, yes. Operator : Your next question is from Ross Fowler from UBS. Please go ahead. Ross Fowler : Good morning, Nick, good morning, Julie. How are you? Thank you for the quote. I very much appreciate that on this end of the phone, so. Nick Akins : Good for you. Ross Fowler : So I just had a couple of questions here. I was going to ask about this peanut, but we've kind of beaten that to death. But the retail strategic computing, that's going to happen within sort of the first half of next year. Are there other businesses that sort of fit into that same sort of potential strategic category? I'm thinking about wholesale services or distributed resources. Are they core to you? Or is that something we could see in the future? Nick Akins : Yes. So obviously, we have 3 -- I guess, 3 of the normal 4 burners already loaded. One's Kentucky, one is the contracted renewables and then the retail after that. And we have to do really a strategic review around retail because it includes some of Ohio and that kind of thing. So we need to fully understand that. And we said that we would look at other parts of the business, if it fuels the growth that we're focused on relative to transmission and the movement to a clean energy economy. And so we'll continue to do that. I don't want to -- I really don't want to position business versus another at this point. But we'll continue to look at all of our business to make sure that we are being as efficient as possible to -- as Julie always says, actively manage the portfolio to ensure that we are moving forward from a growth perspective, but also from a derisking perspective, to ensure that we are spending our capital on the right things and O&M as well. So that's probably all I'll say at this point, and I'll leave it to Julie in the future to answer those questions. Julie Sloat : Yes, yes. I would leave you with this thought. As it relates to on-site partners, which is our distributed energy solutions organization, and we have wholesale services as well when you look at the quadrants of our unregulated components of our total AEP business, I would submit to you that you should assume that they operate business as usual. Those are close to the customer. Those are things that we need to engage in to manage our day-to-day operations and we want to make sure that we're extracting all the intelligence we possibly can and taking care of the customer at the same time. But if there are things we can leverage to help us in the regulated envelope, we'll be doing that as well. So distributed energy solutions seems to scratch that itch. And we've gotten a lot of success and runway out of that. So business as usual. And we'll keep you apprised. Anything else that we put on deck like Nick said, we got all of our burners busy. You know what's on deck. But the point here is to get as efficient as we possibly can so that we can deliver the goods, take care of you, take care of our customer and then where we're good to go. Ross Fowler : Right. Fantastically. And then just maybe one more around sort of the flexibility of your capital spend. As you kind of iterated at the Analyst Day, many times you win a lot of the capital is in transmission. We've seen some other companies maybe struggle to get transmission projects on schedule given the signing and permitting issues. Is that just a large-scale transmission project issue? And do you have sort of just a lot of smaller-scale stuff you can move around in that transmission and even in the distribution bucket? Nick Akins : Yes. So obviously, we've had the same conversation relative to [indiscernible] in Congress. We -- our transmission of large block of our transmission is transmission within our service territory. And actually, the -- just basically the nuts and bolts of making sure that we have rehabilitation of the grid, replacement of old resources. We have some transmission lines. And I just -- every time we have our subcompany Board meeting, I always comment about these 100-year old lines that come up for replacement. And we're still in the process of doing that. We've talked a lot about the amount is the sheer magnitude of AEP's transmission system and the average age being 57 years old or some number like that. And the spend that we have ongoing now just increases by a year, every year it goes by like a 57 to 56 by spending $3 billion. So really -- we have not had issues with the construction of our transmission. Now if you do a new transmission with new large-scale transmission, that's where you really get into permitting and right-of-way issues. And that's really part of the permit legislation. And then when you cross over states, obviously, the cost allocation issues occur. So -- but by and large, almost all of our transmission is really related to transmission that either already exist or within our territory that we have. We certainly have the ability to move forward with. And we also have -- and this is probably more than you asked for, but from a transmission perspective, we've increased our planning associated with that. We used to do 120% of the capital plan. Now we do 130%. And we're also looking at distribution actually to do the same thing around 120%. So those are mechanisms where we continue to be able to use bottles, we continue to be able to adjust based upon different projects being either slowed down, sped up or whatever, and we continually adjust to that because we have thousands of projects to be able to work that through. So that really drives that element of consistency around our ability to provide capital for transmission and in fact, distribution. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will go to the line of Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs. Nick Akins : Looking for something from you, but go ahead. Michael Lapides : Big weekend coming up Alabama LSU. We got 10 days. I hope that's not what you're looking for me from because you're going to get a big role tide at none of us go to Tiger's business. Hey, couple of questions. First of all, I love Slide 41. When I'm looking at Slide 41, Nick, it's a trailing 12-month earned ROE chart. Just curious, when I think about what's embedded in 2023 guidance, which of those get materially better in '23? Which of those face even a little bit more lag in '23 than they do right now? Nick Akins : Yes. Julie? Julie Sloat : Yes, yes. So Michael, what you should anticipate is movement on the PSO front. I mean we've got a little bit of momentum there. We've got the securitization taken care of now. We'll be making an application soon for a rate case. So anticipate that. We do expect over time that APCo is going to improve, too, particularly now that we've got the Virginia triennial behind us, and you're starting to see the fruits of that effort, already showing up in our waterfall slides. And then we've got activity, regulatory activity underway at SWEPCO 2. But we will give you more granular detail at the EEI conference on a company-by-company basis across the board. So stay tuned for that. But as you know, the entire objective is to move the needle and close the gap. And I would submit to you that that's how we describe another aspect of our active management. So we should be in good shape and moving in the right direction. Obviously, we're comfortable with the guidance we already put out there. Michael Lapides : Got it. And then speaking of APCO and the court case in Virginia, and the $37 million pretax benefit you took this quarter, how should we think about that for 2023? I mean, is that just a nonrecurring onetime or should we smooth that out over 23 quarters? I'm just trying to think about how to actually model that. Julie Sloat : Yes, yes. No, I love that question because fussing with that myself as we've got the good news. So yes, $0.06 that you saw in the third quarter, which is essentially like a catch-up from the under earnings from 2017 to 2019. So that's unique. So $0.06 this quarter. And I'll take it a step further. Let's go to the fourth quarter because you probably asked me about that, too. We should have about $0.01 of earnings associated with this particular outcome in the fourth quarter of 2022. So think about that when you're calibrating your model. And then for 2023, we'll have about $37 million of additional revenues from rate increases that effectively covers January of 2021 to September 2022 that in terms of what we should have been able to recognize, but we're spreading it over 16 months plus we have the going forward a benefit that starts October 2022. So what all does that mean? That means $0.06 spread across 2023, and that will be included in the waterfall guidance that we gave to you at EEI. So I hope that helps kind of in the word there for you. Michael Lapides : That does help. And then finally, I last thing. Can you remind us what your cash tax position will be in the coming years? Julie Sloat : Yes, cash tax gets really goofy with the BMT. So those numbers kind of floated all around, and we can always help you behind the scenes with modeling. But for cash tax in 2022, I want to say that the rate is something like 10.8% then go out to 2023. The way we're modeling it is just a little bit over 4%. But I would just direct you back to the GAAP annual effective tax rate. And so we're looking at the traditional 5.2% in 2022, and it pumps up a little bit to about 8.4% in 2023. And but we'll be able to give you more granular there, too, when we roll out all the backup to the 2023 guidance. Yes, the BMT -- it gets -- it almost looks geological when we're looking at some of the modeling -- I mean it works and it's accurate, but it just the rate kind of bounces all over the place from a cash perspective because you're using those tax credits. Operator : And at this time there are no further questions in queue. Please continue. Darcy Reese : Great. Thank you for joining us on today's call. As always, the IR team will be available to answer any additional questions you may have. Luis, please go ahead and give the replay information. Operator : Thank you.

I would now like to turn the call over to our host Ms. Darcy Reese. Please go ahead. Darcy Reese : Thank you, Brad. Good morning everyone and welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Call for American Electric Power. We appreciate you taking time today to join us. Our earnings release presentation slides and related financial information are available on our website at aep.com Today we will be making forward looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for discuss of these factors. Joining me this morning for opening remarks are Julie Sloat, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Anne Kelly, our Chief Financial Officer. We will take your questions following their remarks. I will now turn the call over to Julie. Julia Sloat : Thanks, Darcy. Welcome, everyone, to American Electric Power's Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. I'm happy to be here with all of you this morning, and I'm pleased to be joined by our recently appointed CFO, Ann Kelly, who joined our team in late November. So here we go.  We're making great progress and have a lot to share with you today, starting with the financial performance of our fourth quarter and year. I'll provide update on our Kentucky operations sale, unregulated renewable sale and retail business strategic review. I'll also provide insight into the regulatory and legislative front, as we work to implement important new initiatives to ensure our customers and communities needs, which are met in turn, and drives our high-quality investment proposition.  Finally, I'll include an update -- or I'll conclude with an update on our generation fleet transformation as we continue to invest in regulated renewables and our energy delivery infrastructure, a summary of 2022 highlights and our focus for 2023 can be found on Slides 6 and 7 of today's presentation. As you know, we have a long history of consistently delivering and exceeding our earnings guidance and 2022 is no exception.  I'm very proud of the dedication and accomplishments of the entire AEP team over the past year. While we finished the year strong, I can promise you, we're just getting started. Our robust financial plan continues to yield results. We delivered strong fourth quarter 2022 operating earnings of $1.05 per share bringing our full year 2022 operating earnings to $5.09 per share. We're also -- we also increased our quarterly dividend from $0.78 to $0.83 per share, which we announced back in October. AEP's teamwork-driven performance in 2022 has established a strong foundation from which we can reaffirm our 2023 full year operating earnings guidance range of $5.19 to $5.39, all while mitigating inflationary cost pressures, supply chain pressures and higher interest rates as well as constructively navigating regulatory and legislative frameworks. Formula rates in several of our state jurisdictions and in our high-growth transmission business help us to manage increased interest expense and higher costs. Importantly, as we keep customer affordability top of mind, we are actively working with our states on the economic development front to drive expansion in our service territory, and we are incorporating efficiencies and expense containment into our rate recovery filings to continue to help offset the impact of increased cost pressures. As a matter of fact, the economic development efforts over the past several years are proving to be appreciably beneficial, and we'll talk about normalized load in a few minutes. But to illustrate my point, I can tell you that normalized industrial sales were up 4.5%, largely as a result of those efforts, not to mention the added benefit of attracting jobs, residents and other cascading upside to our communities, all of which helps to manage customer rates given the bigger denominator.  We value our stakeholder relationships, and we made steady progress on the regulatory front over the past year, including achieving constructive base rate outcomes in Arkansas and SWEPCO Texas and a favorable Supreme Court appeal related to Virginia's last rate case and the securitization of Winter Storm Uri costs in Oklahoma. Our resulting earned regulated ROE as of December 31 was 9.1%, which suggests we still have work to do on this front, and I'll talk about our regulatory activity that we have underway to address this. So hang with me for a few minutes, and I'll get there. AEP is leading the transition to a clean energy economy as we engage in one of the largest generation fleet transformations in our industry, in 2022, our 1.5 gigawatt North Central wind portfolio became fully operational with the completion of the Traverse wind farm project, which marked the beginning of our clean energy fleet transition. We'll continue to execute on our fleet transformation strategy with the opportunity to add approximately 17 gigawatts of new generation resources between 2023 and 2032, while mitigating fuel cost volatility and creating a more diverse resource portfolio to benefit our customers. This will significantly contribute to AEP's reduced carbon emissions profile and put us on a path to achieve our upgraded net zero goal by 2045.  Importantly, the recent passage of the Inflation Reduction Act provides support for our clean energy goals, and this will extend our investment runway as we continue to address the needs of our generation fleet. Since assuming the role of President and now CEO, I prioritize simplifying and derisking our business profile, which has become a core standard by which we evaluate our business activity. By actively managing our portfolio and demonstrating a clear commitment to the successful execution of initiatives and transactions, we continue to deliver significant benefits to our stakeholders.  As you are very much aware, we are working diligently to complete the sale of our Kentucky operations to Liberty. You can find the related regulatory time line on Slide 8 in the presentation today. As an update, AEP and Liberty followed the blueprint provided by the FERC order and filed a new FERC 203 application on February 14 of this year, requesting a shortened comment period and expedited approval to meet the contractual April 26, 2023 transaction close date. Immediately after the filing was made, FERC issued a notice incorporating a shortened 45-day comment deadline related to the application. The shortened comment period is a good sign signaling the commission is open to considering our application on an accelerated basis. AEP and Algonquin are in regular communication discussing various aspects of the transaction, the path forward and our partnership. We're mindful of the April 26 date in the stock purchase agreement and are cognizant of the tight time frame given the March 31 comment period deadline.  The objective of both AEP and Algonquin remains clear, and that's to close the transaction. And both parties are firmly committed to moving forward and bringing forth the benefits of this transaction to customers. Related to our unregulated contract renewables portfolio, after strong buyer interest, we're pleased with our announcement made yesterday for the sale of our 1,365 megawatt portfolio to IRG Acquisition Holdings, which is a partnership owned by Invenergy, CDPQ and funds managed by Blackstone infrastructure. A summary of the sale can be seen on Slide 9 of the presentation today.  We're currently targeting a second quarter 2023 close. The utilization of the proceeds from the sale is now reflected in our updated multiyear financing plan on Slide 39, and the transaction proceeds will be directed to support our regulated businesses as we enhance the energy delivery infrastructure and transform our generation fleet. Our near-term focus remains closing on our 2 pending sale transactions Kentucky and our unregulated renewables. Once both of these transactions are complete, we plan to revisit the equity needs in our current multiyear financing plan. As we've been clear in the past we will use the asset sales to responsibly eliminate equity while maintaining a strong balance sheet, no change in messaging on this.  And that's important that I reiterate that. No change in the messaging. Finally, in October 2022, we announced the strategic review of our retail business. We're looking at this business to determine how or if it fits with the current AP portfolio and we'll keep you updated on our progress. We're expecting to complete the strategic review in the first half of 2023.  Let me touch on our regulatory and legislative initiatives that we have underway. We remain focused on reducing our authorized versus actual ROE gap. As I mentioned earlier, our 2022 earned regulated was ?ROE 9.1% and -- our 2023 earnings guidance range assumes a 9.4% earned ROE, and we are already making progress in that direction. In January, we reached the settlement and gain commission approval for our Louisiana base case, which allows us to reestablish a formula rate plan -- as we advance through the year, the team will be active in completing our current base case in Oklahoma and rider recovery of the 88 megawatts of the Turk plant, which is not currently in Arkansas rates. We also filed an electric security plan in Ohio, which will take us into 2024.  Let me shift gears and provide you with an update on our deferred fuel recovery efforts that are currently underway. As we've previously shared with you over the past several months, we have made adjustments to our traditional cost recovery methods in a number of our states to allow for recovery while spreading the cost out for our customers to make them more affordable. In West Virginia, we continue to pursue approval of the pass-through of fuel costs under the fuel clause. We also intend to propose an alternative path to recovery of these costs under proposed legislation, if Approved, that would allow us to securitize these costs and minimize customer impact. The West Virginia Commission recently instructed its staff to finish its prudence review of the 2021 and 2022 fuel costs. The state legislature continues to move the securitization legislation forward with the Commission Chair recently testifying in support before the lawmakers.  I'll conclude my remarks with an update on our regulated renewables strategy and execution. Our capacity needs continue to drive us forward on the regulated renewables front, and we continue to work with our regulators, policymakers and other key stakeholders to ensure a durable and sustainable transmission -- transition to a clean energy economy in our vertically integrated state.  The recently enacted Inflation Reduction Act will help us advance our goals in this area and will provide additional value to our customers as we seek to acquire resources consistent with our plan. We've made considerable progress on SWEPCO's 999-megawatt renewables application, which represents a $2.2 billion investment for AEP. Parties filed a unanimous settlement in Arkansas on January 27 and for a portfolio of owned wind and solar resources. A hearing was held in Texas in January, and we continue to have constructive settlement dialogue with parties in Louisiana, and the hearing date has been formally extended to March 21 to accommodate this. We look forward to receiving the commission's orders, which are expected in the second quarter of 2023 on Louisiana and the third quarter of 2023 for Texas.  In November of 2022, PSO made a regulatory filing in Oklahoma to own 995.5 megawatts of solar and wind projects representing a $2.5 billion investment. A procedural schedule was issued last month which includes a hearing date in April and an expected commission order in the third quarter of this year. Separately, we're also seeking to acquire the 154-megawatt [indiscernible] wind facility in Oklahoma from EDF. FERC approved this acquisition on February 16, and we're pursuing rate recovery of this investment through the ongoing PSO base rate case. The project is already in service and will provide immediate capacity for PSO's customers. Our regulated renewables goals are aligned and supported by our integrated resources plans. In accordance with those plans, we issued request for proposal in 2022 for wind, solar and other resources at APCo, INM and once again at SWEPCO. We anticipate making the related regulatory funds to acquire additional resources under these RFPs throughout 2023.  We continue to see rapid changes in our industry and increasing need and demand from customers and communities across the United States. At the end of 2022, as I prepared to assume my new position at AEP, the team and I dedicated a considerable amount of time and energy to determining how AEP would continue to deliver safe, clean, affordable and reliable energy and how we could deliver this energy faster and more efficiently to our customers while generating enhanced value to our stakeholders. Our long-term earnings growth rate of 6% to 7% is underpinned by a robust $40 billion capital investment plan for 2023 through 2027, which includes $15 billion in transmission and $9 billion in regulated renewables investments.  As evidenced by our fourth quarter and full year 2022 performance AEP has had a long-standing track record of consistently delivering on our strategic objectives, our transformation strategy is working and the investments we're making continue to support our positive earnings growth and results. Now please join me in welcoming Ann to her first AEP earnings call. I'll leave you in her very capable hands as she provides insight and perspective into our performance drivers for 2022 and the details supporting our financial targets. Ann? Ann Kelly : Thank you, Julia and Darcy. It's great to be with you all this morning and thanks for dialing in. I'll walk us through our fourth quarter and full year results, share some updates on our service territory load and our outlook for 2023 and finish with commentary on credit metrics and liquidity as well as some thoughts on our guidance, financial targets and portfolio management.  So let's go to Slide 10, which shows the comparison of GAAP to operating earnings for the quarter and year-to-date periods. As Julie mentioned, we had a strong operating results in both the fourth quarter and for the full year. GAAP earnings for the fourth quarter were $0.75 per share compared to $1.07 per share in 2021. GAAP earnings for the year were $4.51 per share compared to $4.97 per share in 2021. For the quarter, I'll mention that we have reflected additional charges related to the expected sale of Kentucky Power and Kentucky Transco as nonoperating costs. This is largely a result of the delay in the closing from the need to file a new 203 application with the FERC. There are detailed reconciliations of GAAP to operating earnings on Pages 18 and 19 of the presentation today. Today, I'm going to focus more on our full year results, but I did want to provide a few highlights on the fourth quarter as we show on Slide 11. Operating earnings for the fourth quarter totaled $1.05 per share compared to $0.98 per share in 2021.  This is a $0.07 or 7% increase year-over-year. While we had a lot of puts and takes, our vertically integrated and T&D utility segments continued to perform well, resulting from rate changes, transmission revenue and some favorable weather. We did see a $0.03 decline in our normalized retail margin, but that was due to a change in sales mix as low as favorable for the quarter. I'll discuss load in more detail in a couple of minutes. We were also able to support an increase in our O&M expenses as a result of the strong earnings that we were seeing. Transmission Holdco was favorable by $0.03, even after factoring in the loss the Ohio RTO adder as we continue to see the benefits of our investments. Generation and Marketing produced $0.16 per share, up $0.10 from last year, driven by increased retail energy margins and favorable generation performance, primarily driven by fewer average days year-over-year.  And finally, Corporate and Other was down $0.05 per share driven by increased interest expense and investment losses, partially offset by favorable income taxes. Now let's have a look at our year-to-date results on Slide 12. Operating earnings for 2022 totaled $1.09 per share compared to $4.74 per share in 2021. This was an increase of $0.35 per share or 7%. Looking at the drivers by segment. Operating earnings for vertically integrated utilities were $2.56 per share, up $0.30. Due to rate changes across various operating companies, favorable weather, increased transmission revenue and also increase normalized load. Offsetting these favorable variances were higher O&M, increased depreciation expense and increased interest expense.  Once again, the change in accounting around the Rockport Unit 2 lease results in $0.23 of favorable O&M offset by $0.23 of unfavorable depreciation. In the Transmission & Distribution Utilities segment, earned $1.16 per share, up $0.06 from last year. Favorable drivers in this segment included rate changes in Texas and Ohio, favorable weather and increased normalized retail load and transmission revenue. Offsetting these favorable items were unfavorable O&M and depreciation. With the favorable weather and other items that we experienced in 2022, we were able to responsibly deploy additional O&M in both utility segments to spend on items like increased vegetation management to improve system reliability.  The AEP Transmission Holdco segment contributed $1.32 per share, down $0.03 from last year. Favorable investment growth of $0.12 was more than offset by an unaffared true-up of $0.04, the loss of the RTO adder in Ohio and increased income taxes. Remember, our 2022 guidance had this segment down by $0.08 year-over-year as a result of the investment growth being more than offset by the annual true-up to some unfavorable comparisons for taxes and interest. Generation and Marketing produced $0.50 per share, up $0.24 from last year. The positive variance here is primarily due to the sale of renewable development sites, improved generation performance in land sales in the generation business, improved retail margins and increased wholesale margins stemming from favorable market conditions.  And finally, Corporate and Other was down $0.22 per share, driven by investment losses unfavorable interest in increased O&M, partly offset by lower income taxes. The investment losses continue to be impacted by the year-over-year comparisons for our ChargePoint investment that we exited in the third quarter. As we mentioned earlier, we are reaffirming our guidance range for 2023. For convenience, we've included an updated waterfall on our actual 2022 results to the midpoint of our guidance for 2023 on Slide 36. While the variances changed due to the 2022 actual results, there is no change to our 2023 segment or overall guidance. We are confident that our regulatory actions to provide timely returns on our distribution and renewable investments, continued investment in transmission assets, the impact of economic development efforts and prudent O&M management will offset headwinds such as rising interest rates and inflationary pressures.  Now turning to Slide 13, I'll provide an update on our normalized load performance. Overall, 2022 was a remarkable year for normalized load growth across the AEP service territory. Despite the Federal Reserve's intentional actions to slow down the economy, AEP experienced its strongest weather-normalized load growth in over 15 years with 2.8% annual growth. The most impressive part is that this is experience on top of a recovery year. As a reminder, 2021 was the strongest year for AEP's normalized growth in over a decade until 2022. The growth in 2022 was spread across nearly every operating company in every major retail class. Starting in the lower right corner of the slide, normalized retail sales increased by 1.9% in the fourth quarter and ended the year up 2.8% compared to last year. For the quarter, the growth in commercial and industrial sales will more than offset the modest decline in residential sales.  Looking forward, you will see that we are expecting growth of 7% to 10% in 2023. The story is changing somewhat to further remove away from the pandemic. In 2022, the boost from fiscal policy overwhelmed the Federal Reserve's efforts to constrain the economy through monetary policy. In 2023, we expect the fiscal boost to date given the congressional changes after the election, while the Fed's efforts to tame inflation remain in place. We expect this to result in a slight moderation of economic growth for the balance of this year.  Moving to the upper left corner, Normalized residential sales decreased by 0.8% in the fourth quarter but finished the year slightly above 2021. For the quarter, residential customer counts increased by 0.4%, but this was offset by a 1.2% decline in weather normalized usage.  This is not surprising when you consider the impact that higher inflation, energy costs and interest rates on customers' disposable income to end the year. You will notice that we now expect residential sales to decrease by 0.5% in 2023 for the same reason. Moving right, weather-normalized commercial increased by 5.4% for the quarter and ended the year up 4.2% compared to 2021. The growth in commercial sales was spread across nearly every operating company. fastest-growing commercial sectors, professional scientific and tech services that includes data centers, which -- where load was up nearly 30% compared to last year for both the quarter and the year-to-date comparisons.  The outlook for 2023 is showing a modest 0.6% growth. While we do see momentum in this class driven by economic development, the sustained impact of the labor shortage inflation high interest rates and energy costs will act as a headwind in 2023. Finally, focusing on the lower left corner, you see the industrial sales growth moderated in the fourth quarter, up 1.5% and while the year ended 4.5% above 2021. Industrial sales increased at most operating companies in many of our largest sectors.  We continue to experience robust growth in the oil and gas sectors, which were up 6% compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. Outside of oil and gas, which tends to run countercyclical to the rest of the economy, we did notice softer industrial sales growth consistent with many of the economic indicators. As you know, the ISM manufacturing index fell below 50 in the fourth quarter, which is a sign of an industrial contraction. The combination of sustained inflation, supply chain disruptions, increasing borrowing costs, strong dollar and elevated energy costs have formed significant challenges for domestic manufacturing. Fortunately, AEP's past economic development activities are providing an offset and are keeping AEP's industrial sales growth in positive territory. You see that the outlook is showing industrial sales growth of 2.1% in 2023, which is largely attributable to the consistent economic development activities from the past. I'll provide additional detail on the impact of these efforts in the next slide.  To summarize, the AP service territory experienced a remarkable year for load growth in 2022 despite the inflationary pressures on wages and energy and a federal reserve that was intentionally trying to slow down the economy. We are finally seeing evidence that these measures are starting to have an impact, which will result in slower growth in 2023. Fortunately, AEP's disciplined commitment to economic development should keep our load growth in the black moving forward.  For example, absent economic development, our loan growth would have been essentially flat in the fourth quarter and up 1.1% for the year.  Turning to Slide 14, I want to highlight how our commitment to economic development is helping to sustain load growth even in the face of challenging economic conditions. The chart on this slide illustrates why the strategy is so important to us. The blue bars on this chart show the growth of gross regional product for the AEP service territory over the past year. You can see that it has been slowing over the period. And in fact, for the fourth quarter, growth in AEP's GRP was slightly negative compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. However, the green bars here show our industrial sales growth over the same period. You'll notice they have been resilient throughout 2022 without any help from GRP. A lot of the growth in industrial load that we are seeing today is a consequence of economic development projects from previous years. And our focus on economic development is not just about the additional load that we report to you on a quarterly basis. We are also focused on attracting employers to the service territory. We know that adding new loading customers are a key strategy to providing value to all customers. This allows us to continue to prioritize investments that will improve the customer experience while mitigating the rate impacts on our customer base. By making this a key component of our strategy, AEP is helping to mitigate the impact of the economic downturn on our customers, communities and shareholders. And AEP's economic development team has a proven track record of helping to bring these new customers to our service territory with an emphasis on jobs and load. In fact, the AEP service territories added over 141,000 jobs in 2022.  Let's move on to Slide 15 to discuss the company's capitalization and liquidity position. Taking a look at the upper left quadrant on this page, you see our FFO-to-debt metric stands at 13.2%, which is a decrease of 1.3% from the prior quarter. The primary reason for this decrease is the impact on both FFO and short-term debt from a decrease in our mark-to-market collateral positions associated with the decline in natural gas and power prices. as well as a continued increase in our deferred fuel balances.  We remain committed to our targeted FFO-to-debt range of 14% to 15%, and we plan to trend back into that range near the end of 2023 as we continue to work through the regulatory recovery process of our deferred fuel balances, which can drive some volatility in the metrics. You can see our liquidity summary on the lower left quadrant side. Our 5-year $4 billion bank revolver and 2-year $1 billion revolving credit facility support our liquidity position, which remains strong at $2.6 billion. The $1.1 billion change from last quarter is mainly due to an increase in commercial paper outstanding for the reasons I mentioned earlier.  On a GAAP basis, our debt-to-capital ratio increased from the prior quarter by 1.5% to 62.9%. On the qualified pension front, our funding status remained strong, ending the quarter at 102.4%. While assets performed as expected during the quarter, the primary driver for the funded status decreased was due to an increase in the liability caused by changes in actuarial assumptions influenced by the rising interest rate environment in 2022.  Now turning to Slide 16. I'll give a quick recap of today's message. First, we are focused on execution. The Kentucky transaction is back in front of the FERC and Liberty and AEP are committed to moving forward with this transaction. We just announced the agreement to sell our unregulated contract renewables portfolio and are working through the strategic review of the retail business. Each of these actions will help us to simplify and derisk our business. Even as we worked on these initiatives, we didn't take our eye off the ball of managing the business. We finished 2022 with solid earnings and made significant investments to support our customers even with the backdrop of supply chain challenges and inflationary pressures.  We continue to be committed to our long-term growth rate of 6% to 7% and continued dividend growth and a strong balance sheet while derisking the company, focusing on the customer and actively managing the portfolio. We really appreciate your time and attention today. I'm going to ask Brad to open up the call so that we can answer any questions that you may have. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And we'll first go to Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Shahriar Pourreza : So a couple of quick ones here. Looking at just the West Virginia fuel cost recovery, hearings were obviously held in 4Q, and there was a discussion about moving to quarterly time periods as well as securitization. I guess, can you give us maybe an update on how you're looking at the situation where we might be headed from here? There's a lot of moving pieces I guess. So how is the dialogue going? And sort of any sense of bill impact ranges, especially with the recent gas price collapse? Julia Sloat : Yes. I still appreciate the question because shares, I'm sure you can imagine, it is absolutely top of mind for us. And as Ann mentioned in her comments, top of mind from a CFO perspective, most definitely. As you know, we did get an order.  The staff is going through its paces as we had to work through the prudency review. And in the background, what's playing is a legislation that could potentially accommodate securitization of the dollars we have outstanding, our fuel balance in West Virginia $520 million -- so it's not insignificant and it's extremely important to be able to digest this in a way that can accommodate customer rates. So we're hoping that we'll be able to be in a position we'll be able to utilize the securitization legislation, if approved, to be able to smooth this out and take care of customer needs in terms of the bill in path. And I don't know, Ann, do you have any other thoughts on that, how we might do that? Ann Kelly : Yes. No, it's absolutely right. I mean utilizing the securitization allows us to spread it out over time and minimize and actually keep our customer rates relatively flat, which is really the intention. Now this will take some time. It will be effective in June, and we need to commission the order. So we would expect the securitization to take place in the first half of 2024. Shahriar Pourreza : Got it. Okay. Perfect. And then just lastly, on the financing needs. Obviously, we've noticed that you now include both the $1.2 billion expected cash proceeds from Kentucky as well as I think for the first time, the expected $1.2 billion from the contracted renewable sale. I guess looking at the sources and uses, why wait to update your funding needs on the equity side, especially if you're including the proceeds already. Is there anything we should be thinking about here? Julia Sloat : No hidden message there at all, Shahriar. We want to make sure that we get both of these transactions in the bag, get them taken care of and then we'll recalibrate. And as you know, our objective is twofold. We want to make sure we have a strong balance sheet because we don't want anybody worried about any dilutive otherwise actions that we would have to take. So that's first and foremost. So top of mind for us is making sure that balance sheet is in check. And as you know, we put out a target goal for FFO to debt of 14% to 15%. That being said, to the extent that we will then be able to eliminate future equity needs, we don't have a significant amount of equity financing when you look out over the horizon. But if we're able to kind of pull that back a little bit and still hit the objective on the strong balance sheet, we'll absolutely do that. So no hidden message. Obviously, both of these are moving along, contractor renewables new for us. We know that, that will close in the second quarter. We believe that's the plan to close in the second quarter. And as you know, Kentucky is pending with its 203 application. So stay tuned. We just want to make sure that we got this completely right for you all and that you're not concerned. Operator : And next, we'll go to Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. . Jeremy Tonet : I just want to pivot towards the retail business a little bit. And if you could just peel back, I guess, a little bit how that process stands at this point. Just wondering, any thoughts that are be considered here of why that would remain in the portfolio, what might prevent you from selling it? I'm just wondering if you might be able to provide a little bit more color of what's in that business, EBITDA earnings or anything else to wrap our heads around there? Julia Sloat : Yes, absolutely. And I love the question because that's exactly what we're doing in our house right now is going through the paces to determine exactly does it fit -- if there's anything that does fit, what does that look like? Stay tuned. That will be a first half story for AEP. So expect us to be coming to you probably in the second quarter with a little more granular detail because we're literally going through that analysis now and working with the troops to make sure we have that finally, too, so we can get back out to you.  As far as quantifying how big is this business and what does it mean currently to AEP, the net asset position or, I guess, equity position, if you strip out the liabilities, we're talking about $193 million -- the vast majority of that is working capital to the tune of about $150 million of the $193 million, and the rest is largely IT software, and then we have a little smidge of goodwill in there of about $1 million to give you some parameters.  And then another thing that I would think about is what does that mean from an EPS perspective, in 2022, this retail business contributed $0.05 of EPS. And in 2023, we have $0.04 embedded in our guidance to give you that goalpost to. Hopefully, that helps. Jeremy Tonet : That's very helpful. And just going back to the renewables sale here. Was there an EBITDA number that you might be able to share with us or have shared on that? Julia Sloat : We haven't disclosed an EBITDA number. I can tell you that in our guidance for 2023, we're looking at $0.01 that renewable business contributed, I think it was $0.08. Does that sound right, Ann? $0.08, yes? Ann Kelly : $0.08, yes. Julia Sloat : $0.08 in 2022 to give you those parameters. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. That's helpful. And just one last one, if I could. Touching on what Shahriar was talking about with the fuel business what have you. And I guess if moving pieces here, getting back to what the agencies are looking at, how should we think about the cadence of fuel balance normalizing any other items as we get to the 14% to 15% FFO debt target range by year-end '23, I think? Julia Sloat : That's right. We expect to get our -- up to the -- get the ball between the uprates in the last part of the year. We do expect to have a little bit of pressure on the front end as we continue to work through some of the fuel balances. As I mentioned, when you look at West Virginia stand-alone, it's about $520 million. Does that sound right, Ann? Ann Kelly : Yes, $520 million. And as I mentioned, the securitization of that will take some time. So likely won't be done by the end of this year. But -- in terms of our other fuel balances in other jurisdictions, we have positive mechanisms to recover that. And also natural gas rates and power prices are declining, so that will help somewhat as well. Operator : And next, we'll go to Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Steven Fleishman : Yes. So just kind of similar -- similar question on the deferred fuel. If you just looked at the year-end number on FFO to debt, how much do you think deferred fuel represents in terms of impact that's lowering that number? Looking at FFO to debt? Julia Sloat : So we're at 13.2% as of year-end. And so if we get above that 14%-ish range by year-end 2023, I don't know that looks about -- I don't say entirely 100 basis points, but it's pretty significant. Ann Kelly : Yes. I think it actually might be a little bit less than 100 basis when you think about it because we have $1.7 billion of deferred fuel at the end of the year. Steven Fleishman : Okay. That's very helpful. And then just on the ROE improvement to the 9.4 in this year's guidance. Is it -- is there any states that are really driving a lot of that? Are there any states that they're still kind of the most room to go after '23? Julia Sloat : Yes. So here's where I'll draw your attention to. And I know we have the little equalizer chart here in the slide deck somewhere. I think it's on Page 41. And so you can get a sense of kind of where we are hanging out on each of the respective operating company entities. But what we do have in play right now is that at PSO, so Oklahoma, we have a base case underway. So that should help us to begin to heal the ROE, the earned ROE at PSO. So stay tuned for that. So base case in play there. And then as I mentioned in my opening remarks, we recently were able to finalize our Louisiana base case and then reactivate this formula rate plan. So that will get underway to, again, to help move SWEPCO's ROE back up closer to its authorized levels. Kentucky, obviously, you know what we're doing with Kentucky. And APCo, I think APCo, that's why the legislation in Virginia becomes so important to us. because we're in an under-earning position right now. We got the outcome of the Virginia triennial case, which should be beneficial to us in 2023, but I would still expect APCo's ROE to be under pressure until we get, hopefully, some resolution around Virginia legislation that to the extent that we're able to modify the regulatory recovery methods that are being employed in that particular state, we'll begin to see some healing on that particular ROE, too. So our triennial versus say a biennial, AEP is going to lead more toward a biennial or an annual type look versus necessarily that triennial because unfortunately kind of tracks us in an under-earning position, so stay tuned. We'll see how the Virginia legislation process moved along. Our team is absolutely at the table with all the other stakeholders. So that sounds constructive. So we're hopeful and we'll see this developing situation through and then we would expect something to be in the improvement territory for APCo. Steven Fleishman : Just for clarity on that last point in Virginia, why does -- what are things that would help you in the Virginia law, it go into the biannual so you don't have to go so far between cases or something else? Julia Sloat : Anything shorter, Steve, is going to be better for us -- so that will move us in a more productive situation or direction for APCo in particular. I mean an annual rate trout would be fine, too. But again, you can see the direction. So that will be important for us as we work through the different solutions that are being contemplated now because I know we have, I think, 3 bills that are being evaluated or at least shopped in Virginia. But as I mentioned, AEP is absolutely at the table, and we'll see how this ultimately shakes out. Obviously, the benefit needs to go to the customers, but then also our investors as we work to improve the ROE. Operator : Next, we can go to Nick Campanella with Credit Suisse. Nicholas Campanella : I guess just very clear from the filings that have been made so far on the Kentucky transaction that the parties are committed here and you're working towards closing and what is somewhat of a tight deadline. Can you just kind of give us a sense how that changes, if your funding strategy changes at all if this deal weren't to go through and how that would overall kind of change your strategy if it went there. Julia Sloat : Yes. Nick, I still appreciate the question, and I'll let Ann jump in here in a second on what our thoughts are on funding. But I have before I do that, I have to say, we're committed to the transaction. I know you point that out. And I know we do have a tight time line. That's precisely why I threw that out there in my opening comments. The objective is to, I'll say, push for the tape because I know we've got that April 26 date. But importantly, I need you guys to have this takeaway both the AEP and the Algonquin team members continue to have a regular dialogue and work closely together.  So we're all in and we'll continue to push to try to do this as expeditiously as possible. But I think we're also in a good position from a financing perspective. Ann, you want to talk a little bit... Ann Kelly : Yes, absolutely. So I mean should Kentucky not close, we would expect to keep our equity needs the same. So no new equity if that happens. We'll just be managing our FFO to debt as tightly as possible and don't expect any changes. Nicholas Campanella : Okay. That's helpful. I appreciate that. And then I guess just I know we talked a lot about deferred fuel, but we noticed that the CFO is slightly depressed in '23 versus kind of what you outlined at the Analyst Day. And I think you're making up for that in the back part of the plan. But is that purely just deferred fuel impacts? Or is there something else fundamental there? That would helpful. Ann Kelly : Yes, there's really 2 main drivers. Deferred fuel is the biggest piece, but the other piece is we've had some return of collateral from a mark-to-market due to the reduction in natural gas and power prices that has impacted that as well. Operator : Next, we can go to Bill Appicelli with UBS. Unidentified Analyst : Just going back to the Kentucky sale. I know you said that FERC provided for a 45-day comment period so that was look like it was going to be supportive of maybe an expedited ruling. But will we get further indications from FERC, if they will rule an expedited manner? Or do we just have to wait and see? Julia Sloat : Yes. So the next gating item for us is March 31. That ends the commentary period, and we'll just proceed from there. We know the other backdrop for us or backstop for us, as I mentioned in my comments, is the April 26 date. So that's top of mind for us as well. But here's where I continue to go in my mind. None of the benefits yet to the customer until we close the transaction. They don't start in advance. So that's incredibly important. And I think we've got everyone's attention.  And Bill, the other thing that we were particularly sensitive to, and I know Darcy has probably shared this with you, if you've called in, in the interim here, but we really made an effort to take the FERC blueprint to make sure that we were accommodating or addressing the concerns that FERC voiced as it relates to taking care of customers and making sure there's no harm.  And as a matter of fact, if you at the application. I think we go in pre through the new 203 application in pretty granular form. I think it's Pages 4, 5 and 6. Clearly, I've read this a few times. Take a look at that if you want to get a better sense of what the parties have come up with to be able to take care of the customers in the state of Kentucky and specifically Kentucky Power's footprint. So I think everybody is going to be working on an expedited basis and schedule.  And clearly, we very much appreciated the shortened comment period because I do think it's indicative. So we'll continue to work through it and rest assured that both the AEP and Algonquin team members will continue to be in regular contact with one another because at this point, we're partners in all of this. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. No, that's very helpful. And then I guess, what happens if we get to the April 26 date, and we don't have a decision from FERC. Can that be extended or... Julia Sloat : Excellent question, excellent question. And here's how we can answer that for you. I mentioned that the teams are in constant contact and regular contact. I would expect that if we get closer to that date, that the teams will be talking specifically about this. So stay tuned. Operator : And next, we'll go to Durgesh Chopra with Evercore. . Durgesh Chopra : Just first, a quick clarification. The -- I think you mentioned $0.08 for the renewables business EPS. That's just half year, right? So that's what's embedded in the guidance and the full year earnings are double that to $0.16, right? Ann Kelly : No, $0.08 is last year. So the 2022 EPS from renewables, as we mentioned, for 2023, we expect that to be $0.01. Durgesh Chopra : Got it. So that's the full year contribution for 2022? Julia Sloat : That's correct. Yes, $0.08 for 2022, $0.01 for 2023. And so the way I would characterize it, and I think this is how we had the press release neutral to maybe slightly dilutive to the tune of $0.01. So from my chair, I'm not worried about it. Durgesh Chopra : Got it. Okay. And then just, again, I want to go back to the sort of the financing slide. Can you just updated thoughts on use of proceeds here. Clearly, the renewable sale is on track and get $1.2 billion in cash. So how should we think about use of proceeds? Should that at least eliminate equity for 2024? Julia Sloat : Yes. So do you want to take that? Ann Kelly : No. Right now, we are not going to reduce any equity in the outer years. But as Julie mentioned, once we close the Kentucky transaction, the renewables transaction, we're going to we reevaluate and see whether or not we can responsibly take out equity in the future while keeping in mind and having a strong balance sheet. Operator : And next, we can go to Paul Fremont with Ladenburg. Unidentified Analyst : Great. So I guess the first question, right now, the sales proceeds from the 2 transactions actually are in excess of the equity that you had identified last year. So we should assume though that the sales proceeds don't eliminate your equity need, they just reduce it. Is that a fair characterization? Julia Sloat : I think that's a fair characterization. And just as a reminder because Ann wasn't here when we made these announcements last year. But Paul, you may remember, we took out of the 2022 plan -- the 2022 plan, $1.4 billion of equity because we assume that the Kentucky transaction would have closed. We never put that equity back in. And so right now, we're just kind of waiting to have that particular transaction close. And then we introduced the contracted renewables transaction on top of that. So what you see today is versus what we originally had planned, we had already stripped out $1.4 billion of equity. So that's already assumed in this plan versus what we originally had when we announced Kentucky. And so as Ann mentioned, what you should anticipate is we've already assumed all the process both of these transactions are assumed in the multiyear forecast you have on Page 39.  And that once we close on both of them, we like cash. We like cash coming in the door. So once we close on those, we'll be able to recalibrate to make sure we're doing -- hitting 2 objectives : number one, make sure that we're getting to that 15% -- 14% to 15% FFO-to-debt and then being able to tweak, meaning otherwise translation reduce any of those equity needs in those future periods. So don't anticipate us just piping all of that out because we've already assumed the Kentucky utilization was in there, but we may have some wiggle room here to take some additional dollars out in terms of equity once we close on the transaction.  And so no hidden message there. We're just wait until we have the dollars, and we'll be right back to you to be able to take some of those equity needs out assuming we can get the metrics that we need to hit from an FFO-to-debt perspective, and I think we can do it. Unidentified Analyst : Great. And then moving to Virginia. You guys -- or there's a bill, I think that's under duration SB 1075, would you expect that to survive, come out of conference and ultimately be adopted? Or I guess, what's your thought process on what will happen in Virginia? Julia Sloat : Yes. So here's what I have. I have that SB 1075 was amended in the house and then we -- it was transitioned to a biennial. And then we're continuing to work with our legislators and the governors to reach some consensus on the language. And if this does pass, what you should anticipate is that AEP or APCo would file its last triennial in 2023, and that would cover the period through 2022. So we'll see if we can get this across the goal line.  I know we've got some other competing bills or legislation that is being proposed as well, also looks like a biennial situation. Unidentified Analyst : Great. And can you break out for 2022, just the contribution from generation? Julia Sloat : From all of our generating assets or the generation market... Unidentified Analyst : In the G&M section, so the merchant -- in other words, the merchant generation contribution in 2022. Julia Sloat : Yes. I can give you the renewable part, that was $0.08. I have that off the top of my head. I can give you the -- so I'm going to work it a little bit backwards. I give you the retail piece of the business, and that's not the generation component. So that was $0.05. So then you've got, what, $0.13 there of the total earned. We can circle back with you, Paul, and get you that number, though. That would be no problem. Unidentified Analyst : That would be great. And maybe the last question for me. the income tax changes and other and corporate and other, can you maybe give a little flavor as to what drove those? Julia Sloat : Hang on one second here. We're kind of running through my notes because I don't have that in front of me. Ann Kelly : Yes. So the income tax, there's a little bit of geography here with respect to the parent company loss that's driving that impact. And then -- the other is just a lot of very small items that are loan together. Operator : And with no further questions in queue, I'll hand the call back over to Darcy Reese. Darcy Reese : Thank you for joining us on today's call. As always, the IR team will be available to answer any additional questions you may have. Brad, would you please give the replay information.

At this time, your telephone lines are in a listen-only mode. Later, there will be an opportunity for questions and answers. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, your call today is being recorded. I'll now turn the conference call over to your host, Vice President of Investor Relations, Darcy Reese. Please go ahead. Darcy Reese : Thank you, Alan. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the first quarter 2023 earnings call for American Electric Power. We appreciate you taking time today to join us. Our earnings release, presentation slides and related financial information are available on our website at aep.com. Today, we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors. Joining me this morning for opening remarks are Julie Sloat, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Ann Kelly, our Chief Financial Officer. We will take your questions following their remarks. I will now turn the call over to Julie. Julie Sloat : Thanks, Darcy. Welcome everyone to AEP's first quarter 2023 earnings call. It's good to be with everyone this morning. Our direction and strategy remain on track with an emphasis on our generation fleet transformation and continued investment in our energy delivery infrastructure, which is all embedded and our five-year $40 billion capital plan. I'll start with an overview of our financial performance for the first quarter before discussing our Kentucky operations following the termination of our transaction with Liberty. I'll then provide some updates on our unregulated contracted renewable sale, retail business review and other strategic plans before closing with some insight into our progress on the regulatory and legislative front as we work to implement important new initiatives to ensure our customers and communities' needs are met and continue to come first, which you know enables us to deliver on our financial stakeholder commitments as well. A summary of our first quarter 2023 business highlights can be found on Slide 6 of today's presentation. We have a long-standing history of consistently delivering on our strategic objectives, and we're pleased to share that this quarter is no different. Turning to a high-level overview of our financial results. I can tell you that AEP delivered first quarter 2023 operating earnings of $1.11 per share, or $572 million. Weather this quarter ranked as one of the mildest in the past 30 years resulting in an unfavorable impact of first quarter results. Despite this, our thoughtful and disciplined approach to managing the business enables us to reaffirm our 2023 full year operating guidance range of $5.19 per share to $5.39 per share, and with a $5.29 per share mid -- $5.29 per share midpoint and long-term earnings growth rate of -- growth rate range of 6% to 7%. We're confident in the built-in flexibility we have in our business to ensure that we successfully deliver on our financial commitments and continue AEP's strong track-record of financial performance. We're also pleased to report that AEP has experienced minimal financial and operational supply chain impacts to-date, primarily due to our successful efforts to diversify our mix of suppliers and increase our order quantities to minimize the impact on our robust capital investment plan. Ann I'll walk through our first quarter performance drivers and share some perspective on our positive load outlook, as we continue to drive our economic development and service territory expansion. She'll also review the drivers to support our targeted 14% to 15% FFO to debt range. While our FFO to debt is at 11.4% this quarter, I am confident this metric will improve materially by year-end. As I mentioned to you on last quarter's call, simplifying and derisking our business profile is one of our top strategic priorities. By actively managing our portfolio and demonstrating a clear commitment to a disciplined execution of initiatives and transactions, we continue to deliver significant benefits to our stakeholders. Actively managing our portfolio also means staying flexible and being ready to change our focus and adapt our strategy when it becomes clear that certain transactions or initiatives may no longer be viable. A few weeks ago, our team was faced with this very challenge. On April 17, we announced the termination of the sale of our Kentucky operations to Liberty. Ensuring the best outcome for stakeholders remains our top priority and we took a disciplined approach to evaluating the continued pursuit of a sale and what that would mean in terms of economics, regulatory expectations, timing uncertainty. We ultimately determined that the better outcome was to terminate the pending sale transaction and to continue our work to develop a clear strategy for our Kentucky operations. I'm thankful for the team's ability to react and adapt to shifting circumstances for the long-term benefit of our customers, employees and investors. After the termination of the sale, AEP met with the Kentucky commissioners and key stakeholders. We discussed Kentucky Power's future and the collaboration needed so that we may continue to serve our customers in a reliable manner while ensuring the financial health and discipline of Kentucky Power moving forward. In the near term, we're renewing our focus on the region and support -- and our support of the communities we serve. You'll see in the earnings call materials today that Kentucky Power's earned ROE for the 12-month period ending the first quarter of 2023 is 2.9%. This does not reflect a financially healthy utility, which needs to be resolved in consideration of the interest of all stakeholders. The underperformance is due in part to a number of unique issues that are and will be addressed for improvement over the course of the next year. As we think about the opportunities ahead for our Kentucky operations, the actions we will be engaged and include a refocus on economic development, enhanced local system reliability, and controlling customer cost. We plan to file a base case in Kentucky in June with an expected six-month commission approval process, with new rates taking effect in January 2024. Other factors that will be beneficial in improving the financial profile and performance include using securitization to recover deferred storm costs and legacy generating plant balances and rightsizing the rate base. While we pivot in Kentucky, we're focused on the successful execution of other key transactions. In February 2023, we announced an agreement with IRG Acquisition Holdings for the sale of our 1,360-megawatt unregulated renewables portfolio. A summary of the renewable sale can be found on Slide 7. All regulatory filings were made in March, and at this time, we're waiting on approval from FERC under section 203 and clearance from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States and Euro Antitrust. We already have cleared Hart-Scott-Rodino approval and China Antitrust. Consistent with our prior messaging, we expect the sale to close near the end of our second quarter 2023 depending on the timing of regulatory approvals. The proceeds from the transaction will be directed to our regulated businesses as we transform our generation fleet and enhance the electric delivery infrastructure. Furthering our commitment to simplify and derisk the company, and summarized on Slide 8, we've agreed with our joint venture partner PNM Resources to sell our portfolio of operating and developing solar projects in New Mexico. This 50/50 partnership is known as New Mexico Renewable Development, or NMRD. And we hold this within our unregulated operations portfolio, AEP. NMRD owns eight operating solar projects totaling 135 megawatts, 150 megawatt project currently under construction and six development projects totaling 440 megawatts. Last week, an adviser was selected to move forward with the sale process. We anticipate making a sale announcement early in the fourth quarter of this year and will target closing by the end of 2023, subject to timing of regulatory approvals. We also have some news to share with you today. As you know, in October 2022, we announced the strategic review of our AEP Energy retail business, which primarily operates in the PJM markets. We've completed that strategic review and decided that we will start a sales process for that business and will also fold into the process AEP OnSite Partners, which is our unregulated distributed resources business. We've hired an advisor to move forward, and we'll keep you updated on the progress. We expect to launch the sale process sometime this summer, and we'll update you with the details along the way, but currently expect the completion of this transaction in the first half of 2024. We're focused on our core regulated utility operations and continue to evaluate all value additive potential activities to enhance their performance and look for opportunities to recycle capital. As a consequence of this effort, we've decided to pursue a strategic review of three of our non-core transmission joint venture businesses, including AEP's interest in Prairie Wind Transmission, Pioneer Transmission, Transource Energy. These businesses total approximately $551 million in net plant investment for AEP and consists of 370 line miles and four substations of in-service assets, as well as various projects under development in PJM and SPP. We'll definitely keep you posted on our -- or updated on our progress, but we expect to complete our review by the end of 2023 with a conclusion that consists of remaining in or divesting some or all of the businesses. So, let's switch gears and talk about AEP's regulated renewables execution. I'm pleased to share that we continue to make significant progress on our transition to a clean energy economy that provides more stable and predictable cost to our customers. Through our five-year, $8.6 billion regulated renewables capital plan, we have a total of $6.7 billion approved or before our commissions. Most recently, in March to be specific, we made regulatory filings for $1 billion of investment at INM, representing 469 megawatts of solar energy and another 151 megawatts of owned, wind, storage at owned and -- owned, wind and storage at APCo for $466 million. Public Service of Oklahoma Company along with other parties filed a settlement in early April of 2023 in the fuel-free power plan case, which relates to PSO's 995.5-megawatt solar and wind portfolio for $2.5 billion. Like, in any other negotiation, this settlement we focused on the assurance of customer benefits without undue risk to the company. In this case, the settlement provided crucial capacity without fuel expense that'll help address PSO's large capacity need. The case took a positive step forward last week when the judge issued a preliminary opinion approving the settlement on April 27, and the commission has a case on its agenda for today, May 4. For SWEPCO's 999-megawatt renewables project, which represents a $2.2 billion investment, parties recently filed an Arkansas settlement in January for these owned, wind and solar resources. In another positive development in Texas, the administrative law judge that oversaw the evidentiary hearing issued the preliminary order which recommended project approval. And in Louisiana, we reached the settlement, however, we were disappointed that the Louisiana Commission did not approve the settlement on April 26, but we remain optimistic that the matter will be reconsidered at the next meeting this month. We look forward to the continued consideration in Louisiana and orders coming in Arkansas and Texas in the second quarter. It's important to note that our regulated renewables goals are aligned and supported by our integrated resource plans, focused on reliability and customer affordability. In accordance with these plans, we have requests for proposals issued or preparing to be issued for additional resources at each of our vertically integrated utilities. We plan to make related regulatory filings over the next year while taking into consideration commission preferences from previous RFP processes. Now, let me provide an update on several of our ongoing regular and legislative initiatives. We're focused on reducing our authorized versus ROE gap. Have some work to do on that as our ROE was at 8.8% this quarter, driven in part by the unfavorable weather conditions that I mentioned earlier. On the effort to close the gap, I am happy to report that we reached the settlement and gained commission approval in January 23 -- 2023 that closed out our SWEPCO Louisiana base case. A key to this case was the ability to reset rates and recover costs under a formula rate plan. And we have already put this into action as we filed under this provision last month. Similarly, in April, AEP filed a formula rate review in Arkansas, which was authorized by that commission in the last base case. As we advanced through 2023, the team is actively pursuing rider recovery of the 88 megawatts of the Turk plant not currently in Arkansas rates. And the current base case in Oklahoma is set for hearing on May 9. So, we're making progress on the regulatory front. We also worked closely with our stakeholders on the legislative front in Virginia to improve the former triennial rate case process. The new biennial rate process became law in April after active -- after an active legislative session, APCo filed its last triennial in March of 2023 for the 2020 through 2022 period. The new law will require APCo to file its first biennial in 2024 with the biennial continuing in subsequent two-year period. So, it's going to work like this. The pending triennial will put rates in place for 2024 while we litigate the biennial in 2024 for rates effective in 2025, and we can help you with your modeling needs once we get a little further down the line here. Pivoting to our fuel cost recovery efforts for a minute. Our management of fuel cost recovery is a top priority for us with our total deferred fuel balance at $1.6 billion as of our first quarter. We adapted our fuel cost recovery across all of our jurisdictions with a focus on balancing customer impacts. In Texas, the commission approved the $83 million special fuel surcharge filed in October of 2022 and was being recovered subject to review since February 2023. So, making progress there. We are aware of the staff prudence filing last Friday, April 28 in West Virginia that recommended a disallowance of certain fuel costs. The recommendation was rooted in the commission's prior reference to a 69% capacity factor at our coal facilities. Prudence review is a report produced by an outside consulting firm hired by the staff. The report relies on factors beyond AEP's control and takes issue with some of the practices taken to ensure that our power plants would have fuel available to provide electricity during the peak winter period. Those in the area are very familiar with how the historic swing of fuel cost over the past two years placed extreme pressure on the system and fuel recovery mechanisms. We advocated for the securitization legislation that recently passed in West Virginia knowing it provided an effective path to deal with those issues. In line with this strategy, APCo made a filing on April 28 seeking West Virginia Commission approval to utilize the new securitization tool to pay off the $553 million deferred fuel balance as February 28, 2023. The filing also proposes to apply the mechanism to certain storm costs and legacy coal costs in a manner that minimizes cost impacts to customers while still addressing these historical costs. Related to the consultant's prudence recommendation, the new APCo filing also lays out the environment APCo was operating in over this volatile fuel time or time in fuel cost and the actions taken to ensure coal would be available on the most extreme days on the system. Our plan is to collaborate with the commission to address customer and deferred fuel concerns together for constructive path forward in West Virginia. After receiving the commission approval, the plan would be to issue bonds to securitize a combination of deferred fuel balance, deferred storm costs, and legacy coal plan balances in the amount of $1.84 billion in the first half 2024. So, wrapping it up, I'm pleased with the progress we're making, capitalizing on our momentum from 2022. We continue to deliver on our commitments and execute against our strategic objectives. We're taking a thoughtful and disciplined approach to simplify and derisk our business and investments we make to support our positive earnings growth and outlook. I proudly lead a team whose experience and expertise have made it possible for AEP to lay new groundwork for future success while also responding and adapting to the rapid changes we're seeing in our industry. Together, we're delivering safe, clean, affordable, and reliable energy to our customers and communities, all while creating values for our investors. With that, Ann -- I will ask her to now walk through the first quarter performance drivers and provide us with some details on our financing targets. So to you, Ann. Ann Kelly : Thank you, Julie and Darcy. It's good to be with you all this morning, and thanks for dialing in. I'm going to walk us through our first quarter results, share some updates on our service territory load and finish with commentary on credit metrics and liquidity, as well as some thoughts on our guidance, financial targets, and portfolio management. Let's go to Slide 9, which shows the comparison of GAAP to operating earnings for the quarter. GAAP earnings for the first quarter were $0.77 per share compared to $1.41 per share in 2022. For the quarter, I'll mention that we reflected the loss on the expected sale of the contracted renewables business as a non-operating cost, as well as an adjustment to true-up expected cost related to the Kentucky transaction in addition to our typical mark-to-market adjustment. There's a detailed reconciliation of GAAP to operating earnings on Page 15 of the presentation deck. Let's walk through our quarterly operating earnings performance by segment on Slide 10. Operating earnings for the quarter totaled $1.11 per share or $572 million compared to $1.22 per share or $616 million in 2022. The lower performance was primarily driven by the unfavorable weather, as Julie mentioned. When looking at historical weather in the first quarter of the past 30 years, we've only seen one quarter with more mild weather than the first quarter of 2023. Operating earnings for our Vertically Integrated Utilities were $0.52 per share, down $0.07. Favorable drivers included rate changes across multiple jurisdictions, normalized retail load, off-system sales primarily associated with Rockport Unit 2, transmission revenue and depreciation. I have more to share and load and performance, and we'll get to that in a minute. These items were more than offset by unfavorable weather, higher O&M and income taxes largely related to timing differences between the years and interests. We expect the year-over-year interest variance to be more pronounced in the first half of the year, as interest rates have somewhat stabilized. We also expect to see favorable O&M in the second half of the year compared to prior year, reflecting the timing of O&M spending and near-term actions that we are taking to help offset the unfavorable weather, such as holding positions open, reducing travel and adjusting the timing of discretionary spending. These actions are in addition to our ongoing efficiency efforts that allow us to offset the impact of inflation each year. I would like to take a second to talk about the off-system sales and depreciation. Due to the purchase of Rockport Unit 2 in December, we are seeing $0.05 of favorable off-system sales year-over-year since the margins are no longer shared with our retail customers. Also, due to the expiration of Rockport Unit 2 lease, I&M will see approximately $0.055 net favorable depreciation each of the first three quarters of 2023, plus an additional $0.035 in Q4. Including the impact of the Rockport lease, depreciation was $0.02 favorable versus the first quarter of last year. However, if you exclude the impact of the lease, depreciation would have been about $0.04 unfavorable, which is consistent with the incremental investment and a higher depreciable base in our Vertically Integrated Utilities segment. The Transmission and Distribution Utilities segment earned $0.24 per share, down $0.06 compared to last year. Favorable drivers in this segment included rate changes from the distribution cost recovery factor rider in Texas and the distribution investment rider in Ohio, as well as transmission revenue. Offsetting these favorable items were unfavorable weather, unfavorable O&M largely due to higher distribution spending in the quarter, higher interest and lower normalized retail sales due to customer mix. The AEP Transmission Holdco segment contributed $0.35 per share, up $0.01 compared to last year, primarily driven by $0.02 of favorable investment growth. Generation & Marketing produced $0.09 per share, up $0.06 from last year. Favorable drivers here include a higher retail and wholesale power margins, favorable development site sales, depreciation, and taxes. And finally, Corporate and Other was down $0.05 per share, largely driven by unfavorable interest. I'll note that this is due to both an increase in interest rates as well as higher debt balances. I'd like to remind everyone that we reflected the higher interest rates in our guidance that we provided on our year-end 2022 earnings call. While the quarter was unfavorable to the prior year, we are taking actions to offset the unfavorable weather, including the O&M refinements that I just mentioned, that give us confidence to reaffirm our full year guidance range. Turning to Slide 11, I'll provide an update on our normalized load performance for the quarter. We've continued to see load growth outperform when it's proving to be a weak economy across our service areas. This is most evident when comparing load performance across retail classes. So, we are seeing some weakness in residential loads. Our commercial and industrial classes are benefiting from new large customer volumes from our ongoing economic development efforts. This provides some potential upside to the full year outlook. Beginning in the upper left hand corner of the slide, normalized residential load was down as customers continue to be squeezed by the relationship between inflation and income growth. That relationship is a key driver of residential usage, and we expect to see it stabilize over the rest of the year. While we are seeing a decline in residential uses for customer, total residential customer counts were up by 0.5%, demonstrating growth in our service territory. Looking through the rest of the slide, you'll see that this was substantially offset by gains in our commercial and industrial loads attributable to new large customer additions. Normalized commercial sales accelerated an exceptional 7.8% compared to the first quarter of 2022. Though the growth in commercial sales was spread across many of our operating companies, gains were especially robust in AEP Texas and AEP Ohio, attributable to the new data center projects coming online in the new year. Outside of data centers, commercial gains were driven primarily by real estate, general merchandise stores, and food and drink establishments as individuals continue to move more freely in the wake of the pandemic. If we look to the lower left hand corner, we see the industrial sales resume their healthy pace of growth, increasing 5.1% from a year ago. As with commercial sales, gains were most robust in AEP Texas, while SWEPCO also experienced double-digit growth in its industrial sales. Looking at individual sectors, gains are most pronounced among oil and gas extraction and primary metal. You'll note that despite our strong commercial and industrial results for the first quarter, our expectations for 2023 load growth are still muted. Probability of a national downturn is extraordinarily high, and it's clear that activity is already slowed to a point that it's having a material impact on our customers' finances. While we expect the pace of economic growth to slow further, we don't anticipate a severe economic contraction across our service area in 2023. Though weaker than they were a year ago, household finances are still healthy by historical standards. Furthermore, the labor market continues to be resilient in the face of Fed rate hikes, which will serve to limit the severity of a potential downturn. These assumptions have been baked into our full year guidance for some time allowing us confidence that our projected load growth for 2023 is very much achievable. Adding to that confidence is our believe that there is more upside to our load projections than downside, stemming from a disciplined commitment to economic development across our service area. We know that working with local stakeholders to attract more economic activity is a key strategy to providing value to our customers. This allows us to continue to prioritize investments that will improve the customer experience while mitigating the rate impacts on our customer base. So, let's move to Slide 12 to discuss the company's capitalization and liquidity position. Taking a look at the upper left quadrant on this page, you can see our FFO to debt metric stands at 11.4%, which is a decrease of 1.8% from year-end and below our long-term target. The primary reason for this decrease is a $1.9 billion increase in balance sheet debt during the quarter, partially due to the return of the mark-to-market collateral positions associated with the decline in natural gas and power prices. Return of collateral also reduces our funds from operations, so it hits us on both sides of the equation. Without the fluctuations in our mark-to-market collateral positions, our FFP to debt metric will be closer to 13%. We expect that this metric will improve by year-end as we reduce debt after the close of the announced renewable sale and our 2020 equity units conversion, and our funds from operation improve over prior year, predominantly in the fourth quarter. We remain committed to our targeted FFO to debt range of 14% to 15% and plan to trend back into this range early in 2024 as we continue to work through the regulatory recovery processes of our deferred fuel balances. You can see our liquidity summary in the lower left quadrant of the slide. Our five-year $4 billion bank revolver and two-year $1 billion revolving credit facilities that was just extended to March 2025 support our liquidity position, which remains strong at $3.4 billion. The $800 million increase in liquidity from last quarter is mainly due to a decrease in commercial paper outstanding from long-term debt issuances. On a GAAP basis, our debt to capital ratio increased from the prior quarter by 1.2% to 64.1%. We plan to trend back closer to 60% this year as we close our announced sale transaction and complete our previously planned equity units conversion. On the qualified pension front, our funding status decreased 1.1% during the quarter to 101.3%. Rates fell during the quarter, which caused the pension discount rate to decrease, driving an increase in the liability that was greater than the gain on assets. Now turning to Slide 13. The first quarter has brought a significant challenge our way in the form of unfavorable weather. As we progress through the remainder of the year, we will continue to take action to manage our business and mitigate this impact. Our core business remains in a strong position and we are reaffirming our operating earnings guidance range of $5.19 to $5.39. We also continue to be committed to our long-term growth rate of 6% to 7%. As Julie previously addressed regarding the terminated Kentucky sale transaction, we are establishing a new -- a renewed focus in long-term strategy in order to maximize the full potential of our Kentucky operations going forward. We are on track to close the divestiture of our unregulated contracted renewables portfolio in the second quarter of this year, have announced the sale of our retail and distributed resources businesses, and are embarking on a review of some transmission joint ventures. These initiatives will help us to simplify and derisk our business while we continue to focus on the fundamentals, executing the $40 billion transmission, distribution and regulated renewables capital plan, disciplined O&M management and positive regulatory outcome. We really appreciate your time and attention today. And with that, I'm going to ask Alan to open the call so we can hear what's on your mind and answer any questions that you have. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of David Arcaro with J.P. Morgan. Go ahead. David Arcaro : Hi, thanks so much for my question. Dave Arcaro at Morgan Stanley. Let's see, maybe starting on the transmission business, I was wondering if you could elaborate a little bit on your strategic thinking there. What makes those assets non-core? Why that size of assets? And wondering what you're thinking -- if it does come to a divestiture decision, what you would plan to do with the proceeds? Could that reduce equity needs in the plan from here? Julie Sloat : Yeah, thanks so much. Appreciate the question. As we continue to talk about simplifying the business, I wouldn't necessarily put the transmission strategic review of the JVs as a derisking, because we are very comfortable with the risk profile of transmission, JV or otherwise. So that being said, this is more about simplification and really focusing on our ability to deal with customers in our footprint. So, nothing wrong with these assets. We love the assets. But we'd really like to take those dollars and channel them toward the traditional core utility business and transco utility business we have at American Electric Power. So -- and why Transource and Pioneer and Prairie Wind? Again, those are outside of our traditional footprint that we have today. ETT is a little different, and it is not necessarily under currently -- or not under current review at this point, as we focus on these pieces that are outside of our footprint. So, we'll see how this goes as far as utilizing any proceeds that we would have from a sale transaction should that occur. Again, this is a strategic review. We haven't made any decisions yet. What you should expect us to do is the same thing we've been talking about, dollars get channeled to traditional investment in the regulated utility operations. Clearly, have a lot to do on the transmission side. But when you bring dollars in the door, our expectation is to maintain a very healthy balance sheet. We've got a little bit of work to do. Ann talked about that in her opening comments. The metric should heal by the end of the year. So, we feel confident in that regard. But going out further in the timeline, we would always look to make sure the metrics are good. And then if we can, responsibly reduce equity issuances in future periods. But again, strategic review underway. We'll keep you apprised. And I would expect this would be more of a story as we get through the end of 2023 with the strategic review. And if anything were to occur, being 2024 story for us. So, thank you for the question. Operator : We'll go next to line of Jeremy Tonet with J.P. Morgan. Go ahead. Aidan Kelly : Hi. This is actually Aidan Kelly on for Jeremy. Good morning. So just shifting to the New Mexico and retail distributed resources sales, could you talk more about the prospective of buyer market you're seeing right now? Any insight on the type of buyer you would be interested here? Also, just any language on OnSite Partners as well with the G&M segment would be great. Thanks. Julie Sloat : Yeah, you bet. So let me take a couple of different tacts at this. So number one, as you know, we've had a strategic review underway for the retail business. So that shouldn't be a surprise. Scooping in the OnSite Partners businesses is the new addition today. Those comprise about -- Energy Partners is about, I'd say, $0.04 of -- I'm sorry, I should say, retail business is about $0.04 of the component that we're talking about in terms 2023 guidance. OnSite Partners is about $0.02. So let me give you those parameters, so you know exactly what we're talking about. NMRD is about $0.01 of the 2023 guidance. You got a few pennies there that we're playing with. As far as who are the likely buyers, let me answer it this way. We're already dealing with a multitude of buyers from our unregulated contracted renewables business. So, we're very familiar with that space because we have that contract underway with that piece of the business. NMRD, I would think would fit more closely with that type of activity in terms of the parties that might be interested in that particular asset base. But then let's move to the retail business. I think you got a little bit more of a narrower or more unique buyer set for that particular piece of the business. And then -- and I won't go into any names, but just given the nature of the business, the field narrows just a touch. And then on the distributed part of the business, meaning OnSite Partners, it got hundreds of parties that could be potentially interested in that. The other thing that we're thinking about is when we start working with our financial advisor to move forward with the transaction, there could be a situation where you have a combined platform where both the retail and the distributed pieces of the business are put together and sold that way. But we're completely open to separating the [two tube] (ph) just because you've got different buyer bases. Can't really opine on it yet just because we're just getting started with it, but we will absolutely keep you apprised of what our progress is and what we're experiencing as we move through time here. So early stages, but well underway in terms of getting the financial advisor kicked off and then the process started. Operator : We have a follow-up question from the line of David Arcara with Morgan Stanley. One moment, please. Apparently, that line is not in queue. We'll go next to the line of Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Securities. Go ahead, please. James Ward : Hi. This is James Ward on for Shar. Thank you for taking our questions. First, as you look towards your June rate case filing in Kentucky, how are you thinking about the key asks in this case? And as a follow-up, could you expand on how you see capital allocation to this jurisdiction developing in the context of your overall investment plans over the forecast period? Julie Sloat : I still appreciate that. And I get it, you guys have a really busy morning. So, I know we have different names who don't typically cover us. So, I just -- I'm still appreciative of your time and attention today. Lots of companies reporting. So that being said, on the Kentucky front, stay tuned, because what you'll -- you should expect us to do is be in conversations with the different stakeholders, with the commission, and staff in particular in Kentucky to make sure we're scratching all the inches. We want to be successful in the arena. And we are going to absolutely have a very thoughtful approach in sensitivity to reliability. We need to make sure that we're keeping the lights on and keeping them affordable for the state of Kentucky and the area that we serve in particular. So, I have a lot of granularity to share with you today other than to assure you that we will be working collaboratively with the partners in that jurisdiction. So, extremely important to us particularly when you look at where the current ROE is. We need to get that up. We need that utility company to be in a healthy situation so we can continue to have low cost capital allocated to that particular piece of the business. And then, I'll ask Ann to talk a little bit about our capital allocation and how we're going to digest that from Kentucky. Ann Kelly : Right. So, our capital plan, the $40 billion capital plan going forward is not going to change. We would just be reallocating from other areas within the same segment. So, you would expect to see the transmission, distribution, generation, all those planned numbers for the five-year timeframe will stay the same. We will just allocate within jurisdictions to Kentucky to make sure that they are focused on reliability, as Julie mentioned. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Durgesh Chopra with Evercore. Go ahead. Durgesh Chopra : Hey. Good morning, team. Thanks for giving me time. Hey, just I know you gave us property plant and equipment number on the transmission assets, which are up for strategic review. Is there a rate base number that you have handy that you can share with us? If not, I'll just follow-up with Darcy. Julie Sloat : You know what, Durgesh, thank you so much for your question. I don't have a rate base number in front of me. We can absolutely get that to you though. So, we'll circle back with you. But the $551 million, as you point out, is the net plant position that is attributable to AEP in particular. Operator : We'll go next to the line of Andrew Weisel with Scotiabank. Go ahead. Andrew Weisel : Hi, good morning. Thank you. First question on the balance sheet. Just to clarify, if none of these transactions move forward besides contracted renewables, what's your degree of confidence in the targeted credit metrics and FFO guidance, and over what time period? Ann Kelly : Yeah. So what I talked about earlier was based on that scenario. We have not modeled in any additional asset sales transactions besides the contracted applicable. So, we would expect an improvement by year-end and getting it within our targeted metrics early next year. Operator : We'll now go to the line of Anthony -- pardon me, Anthony Crowdell with Mizuho. Please go ahead. Anthony Crowdell : Great. I guess two quick questions. One is on Slide 27 that shows the underearning gap. I guess when I look at the like five OPCos that are under earning anywhere between 90 to greater basis points. What's a reasonable assumption of underearning we could assume when you closed that gap and during what timeframe? And then the follow-up is -- and I may have not heard correctly. I think -- I don't know if it's a Turk plant or the Rockport plant, you've bought back or it's maybe not part of lease or maybe I didn't hear that correctly. Does that now move to the G&M segment in reporting? Thank you. Julie Sloat : Yes. Thanks so much for the question. I'm going to take your first one on the ROEs. I'm going to back up the truck a little bit. You may recall when we provided 2023 earnings guidance, the average ROE across the system for our regulated businesses was going to be around 9.4%. Today, as you know, we're at 8.8%. So here's my expectation. I expect we're going to close that gap as we get toward the end of the year. And as you know, I mentioned several different regulatory filings and successes that we've had in 2023 that are going to help us close that gap. So we feel confident that gap will close, but I do expect that we'll be a little under that 9.4%. Importantly, we have not changed our earnings guidance, so we still plan to get within the goalpost on the earnings guidance and growth rates. So I'm not worried about that either, but it's going to take us a little longer to close the gap versus the 9.4% that we had in that 2023 guidance. So, I'll leave you with that. And as you know, we're not dependent on any single one utility company to get in a direct earning level relative to authorized, that's the benefit of having a portfolio of utilities. But boy, I surely would love to close that gap and be within 10s of basis points versus the authorized in each of our jurisdictions. That's an objective. It's just going to take us a little while to get there because, as you know, these things have a little bit of a lead time on them. So stand by and know the guidance is sound. And then on the Rockport unit, that actually it becomes a merchant unit. And I believe that's captured in, what, our Vertically Integrated Utilities segment, right? And that would be captured as off-system sales, okay? So, hopefully, that will help you with your modeling needs there, too. Ann Kelly : And that's due to the ownership structure. So, we didn't want to move it because it's still owned by the Vertically Integrated Utilities. Operator : We have a follow-up question from the line of Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim. Go ahead. James Ward : Hi. James Ward here again. Thank you for this follow-up. Unrelated to the prior question, just wanted to ask, assuming the successful eventual sales of both your retail business, distributed resources and the three non-core transmission JVs you highlighted today, how should we think about the source of funds for future financing needs? And specifically, will asset sales and capital recycling always factor into your financing approach? Or is there a point at which you would no longer look to recycle assets? Thank you. Julie Sloat : Yes, I -- this is Julie. I'll hand it to Ann here in a minute. Here's how I look at it. Simplification and derisking the business should be part of our fabric. So, we are going to continually look at where the best use and highest value is for each of the dollars that we put to work. So I think that's our job is to make sure that the portfolio of assets we have is the best we can have in the highest earnings. You go back to the question I just answered around earning your authorized ROE, we have to do better at that, and we'll continue to do better at that as we go down the path here. So, I do think you should keep that in back of the mind. We will continue to keep you updated on and signal to you if we think there's a business that might fit that profile that we would consider recycling it. But the ones that you see us talking about today are the ones that are absolutely those in terms of strategic review on the JV side of the house, transmission that -- we love transmission, but we may be able to put that to better use inside the traditional footprint. And then, clearly, on the unregulated side of the house, we want to derisk and simplify. It makes complete sense to move forward with those actions that we outlined today. So Ann, I don't know if you want to talk any more about or add any additional color to that? Ann Kelly : Yeah, I mean you're absolutely right, Julie. And when we look at the cash flows, which are on Slide 24 that we've only modeled in the contracted renewables sale here. So any additional sales proceeds will also be able to strengthen the balance sheet. And as we mentioned, we could potentially selectively reduce the equity issuances going forward, while maintaining the same capital plan. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Sophie Karp with KeyBanc. Go ahead. Sophie Karp : Hi. Good morning, and thank you for taking my question. I wanted to ask you about the Texas utilities and the ROE gap there. I guess in Texas, the regulatory recovery mechanisms are very constructive, right? So, you have your DCRF and TCOS and whatnot. So what needs to be, I guess, addressed there to close that gap specifically? Could you speak to that? Julie Sloat : Yeah, I still appreciate that question. So thanks for being on the call today. We're working on it. So let me start with the backdrop on the story. As you know, we continue to channel a great deal of capital to AEP Texas. We do think the recovery mechanisms there are very good. We always think there's opportunity for improvement. So I'll talk about that here in a moment. But one of the things that we've gotten comfortable with, with the touch of underearning relative to authorized in Texas, is the amount of growth that we have in Texas. So on average, we can grow earnings there at 10%, but I got to take a little bit of a haircut because no regulatory recovery is perfect. But we're trying to work on that. And so for example, if you read on Page Number 27, there's some commentary under the little earnings bubble there that we talk about bi-annual TCOS filings to recover significant capital investment. Those good things. We love that. We do have some legislation that is in process and working through that relates specifically to the DCRF and the ability to shorten that timeframe. So maybe we can do that twice a year versus annually. So that will help to kind of close that gap a little bit. And then there's also some legislation around cap structures, too, that might be helpful to us. So, we're trying to work all the different angles. Not to mention the other thing that we're thinking about and continue to talk about is, a way to continue to use those excellent cost recovery mechanisms that are much more progressive in Texas throughout the period, even when you're in for a base case. So, we're trying to use the legislative aspects as well as just trying to be as efficient as possible to close that gap. But we've been comfortable in the near term, taking the little bit of a hit relative to authorized on the ROE because we can grow earnings there and the demand is there. So that was the rationale. But we love the business. We're just trying to make it better in terms of recovery. Operator : We'll go now to the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Go ahead. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, good morning, team. Thank you guys very much. Appreciate the time. Just following up on a couple of the remarks earlier. Just can you elaborate a little bit more on next steps here as you think about Louisiana? Obviously, a little bit of a setback here, but you alluded to potentially putting this back on the -- or maybe not you all, but perhaps the commission electing to reconsider the matter next month. Can you elaborate on the procedural element there, but also some of the other avenues, there's a flex consideration here that can be pursued to the extent to which there may be different outcomes? Julie Sloat : Yes. Julien, thank you for being on the call today. And that is absolutely top of mind for us. As you know, and I mentioned in my opening comments, we're able to get to a settlement agreement and the Louisiana staff filed constructive testimony with conditional approval, all that good stuff. So, we want to continue to work that angle. And actually, one of the commissioners suggested that the decision could be recalled at the next meeting for reconsideration once some additional information is shared. So, we have that top of mind for us. So here's what you should expect from SWEPCO. You should expect to see us seeking rehearing in which we continue to be optimistic that we can pool this across the goal line. So, stay tuned on that. I don't want to get too much in the weeds on it just yet because we're literally in game with that right now. And then specifically, we would hope that this is going to move forward, and we'll have all three jurisdictions stepping in line and be able to absorb with positivity, the applications that we have in front of them. But do we have flexibility in terms of flexing up in the other jurisdictions? On a discrete basis, we think that there is that opportunity with the different projects that we have that are included in that filing. So again, nothing specific to share today. But rest assured, we're looking at all the different tools and angles in the tool bag there that we're able to use should we need a different route if Louisiana can't get there. But we're optimistic and we're having conversations, so stay tuned. Operator : We'll go next to the line of Paul Fremont with Ladenburg. Go ahead. Paul Fremont : Thank you. I guess my first question is on FFO to debt. In order to hit the sort of the 14% to 15% targeted range, should we assume that you need to basically collect on the $1.6 billion in fuel deferrals? And can you give us a sense of the timing that you would expect to recover those amounts? Ann Kelly : Yes, I'll take that, Julie. So, we would expect to collect over the extended timeframes that we have already agreed upon within our jurisdictions. And with respect to West Virginia, we have that model taking advantage of the securitization in the first quarter or the first half of next year. Operator : We have a follow-up question from the line of Sophie Karp with KeyBanc. Go ahead. Sophie Karp : Hi. Thank you for giving me more time. If I can ask a follow-up on Kentucky, right, like asked differently, when you spoke to regulators there, and clearly, you need to bring the ROE up, right? But what kind of a rate increase would that require for Kentucky rate payers? And like do you get the sense of kind of like the upper limit of the appetite that the regulators might have for rate increases in this environment? Julie Sloat : Yeah. So, let me answer that this way. I don't have specific numbers to share with you today because when we actually had the conversation, we hadn't announced earnings yet, okay? So that's new information today, that's public today. And so this will be the go-back conversation that we'll have. And again, the plan is truly to collaborate, because I'm confident that the commission and the commissioners are interested in having a very sound -- financially sound utility company. And so we'll all be working in that same direction. Now as far as tools in the tool bag, obviously, we'll try to influence the top-line with economic development and things of that nature. That takes a little longer, as you know, because it's got a little longer lead time on it. But we know we're really successful with that, too. So stay tuned. And then, of course, we'll be very sensitive to cost as well. The other thing that will be top of mind for us is using the new tools in the tool bag is securitization, okay? So, we've got deferred storm costs that are sitting on the balance sheet. We have an opportunity to take care of net plant of legacy coal plants that's sitting on the balance sheet, too, to the tune of something like $290 million associated with Big Sandy. So those are things that we'll be able to securitize and then kind of back into what -- how we need to make that math work. And I mentioned that also talks about or at least strikes at the idea of kind of rightsizing the rate base. So, we work with the commission and all the various stakeholders in the state of Kentucky that we deal with to make sure that we're getting where we need to be. But honestly, from my seat and from a utility seat, just 2.9%, it's not healthy. We need to get it in a healthy situation. And that will be top of mind for us, because we've got to keep the lights on to and keep it affordable. So stay tuned. We don't have a lot of color to share today because we're literally in game. This is a new data point with 2.9%, okay? But Sophie, thank you for jumping back in line. Operator : We have a follow-up question from Paul Fremont with Ladenburg. Go ahead. Paul Fremont : Thanks. So, the assumption is that you will -- that you're assuming you'll get securitization in West Virginia as part of getting to the -- to that 14% to 15% FFO to debt? Julie Sloat : Paul, this is Julie. Actually, securitization will be a great thing, and that helps us, give us a little more flexibility, more importantly, it's good for the customer. And so, when we filed for our new ENEC filing that we made on what was it like February -- I'm sorry, April 28, I think, was the date that we filed it. What you'll see is that we have two proposed options to recover the fuel balance in our filing. And one is to spread the recovery over three years, and the other is to use securitization for the under-recovered fuel balance. And as part of that, we also looked in as an option, again, with the idea and backdrop and motivation is to protect the customer rates because we can't have them trying to swallow a watermelon here is to essentially securitize plant balances from legacy coal plants, so Amos and Mountaineer in particular, and I think we have some storm costs in there as well. And so when I mentioned today, that $1.84 billion number that we would like to securitize, that's all in. And so, we're trying to give the commission options so that we can all work collectively to make sure that the citizens and customers of West Virginia are protected, but that we still have a healthy utility and we're able to hit the balance sheet metrics that we need. So, it's doable. It's absolutely doable, we'll just need to move through the process. Ann Kelly : And one thing just to add on FFO to debt, when you think about just the quarterly dynamics, in Q4 of last year, due to market conditions, we did have a significant outflow of collateral as well as an increase in deferred fuel. So, as we get through that this year, and that quarter rolls off, that will significantly help our FFO to debt as well. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We have a follow-up question from Paul Fremont with Ladenburg. Pardon me, that line did not open up. We have Bill Appicelli with UBS. Go ahead. Bill Appicelli : Hi, good morning. Most of my questions have been asked and answered. But just a question around the timing of the approval for the contracted renewable sale. You made the filing on March 22. I guess what gives you the comfort that you'll get approval in Q2? And I guess what's the -- what do you need to demonstrate in those filings to get approval both at FERC and on the Committee on Foreign Investment? Julie Sloat : Yes. So as far as FERC and the other two approvals that we'll need to get, let me answer it this way. When we made the filing initially, we had requested at FERC a 60-day approval process. So, we would like to get an order within 60 days. May 22 would be 60 days. And given that this is normal kind of traditional business unregulated, not tied to significant customers and multiple stakeholders, we don't anticipate any material roadblock as it relates to getting not only FERC approval, but the clearance from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States and/or approval under any of the applicable competition loss. So we're comfortable with where we are and expect that we should have that in pretty short order, which gives us confidence to say we think that we'll get this done by the end of the second quarter at the latest. But we'll keep you apprised if anything were to come up. But at this point, we're past commentary periods, and everything seems to be going relatively smoothly. So, anyway, I'll leave it at that, and suggest that if anything shifts, we'll be right in front of you immediately. Operator : We have no further lines in queue at this time.

At this time, all parties are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to our host, Vice President of Investor Relations, Ms. Darcy Reese. Please go ahead. Darcy Reese : Thank you, Brad. Good morning everyone, and welcome to the second quarter 2023 earnings call for American Electric Power. We appreciate you taking time today to join us. Our earnings release, presentation slides and related financial information are available on our website at aep.com. Today, we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors. Joining me this morning for opening remarks are Julie Sloat, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Ann Kelly, our Chief Financial Officer. We will take your questions following their remarks. I will now turn the call over to Julie. Julie Sloat : Thanks Darcy. Welcome everyone to American Electric Power's second quarter 2023 earnings call. Good to be with everyone this morning. It's a rapid time of change in our industry with new opportunities resulting from federal policy shifts and evolving state and customer priorities. We also continue to navigate a dynamic environment with rising interest rates and supply chain constraints. In short, it's definitely an exciting time to be at AEP as we make significant progress on our important stakeholder commitments and strategic objectives, including delivering on our 2023 operating earnings guidance and 6% to 7% annual operating earnings growth, providing dividend growth in line with earnings, strengthening our balance sheet as we move through the next few quarters, actively managing our portfolio, achieving net-zero by 2045 and central to our purpose, keeping our customer rates affordable. We recently made some organizational adjustments such as the restructuring of our Federal Affairs function, the realignment of our regulatory team, and the refreshment of some of our operating company presidents. These changes will help us to operate more effectively and facilitate our success in this ever-changing environment. As always, we keep the customer at the center of every decision we make. This is why we engage with our federal and state regulators so we know how to best support our operating companies while we balance investor preferences as we grow the business and invest $40 billion over the next five years in new generation resources and our energy delivery infrastructure. This morning, I'll provide a brief overview of our second quarter financial performance before getting into our measured and disciplined approach to simplifying and de-risking our business profile through our portfolio management activities. Related to this, I'll share some updates regarding our unregulated contracted renewables portfolio, retail and distributed resources businesses, and the status of our strategic review of our non-core transmission joint ventures. While we still have a lot of work to do on the regulatory front, I'll conclude by providing insight into the recent successes related to our renewables execution and developments on our regulatory and legislative initiatives as we keep our customers\u2019 needs top of mind. A summary of our second quarter 2023 business highlights and a high level overview of our financial results can be found on Slide 6 of today's presentation. AEP delivered second quarter 2023 operating earnings of $1.13 per share or $582 million compared to $1.20 per share or $618 million last year. The year-over-year decline reflects the timing of higher interest rates in the reversal of last year's second quarter 2022 favorable weather. Today we're pleased to reaffirm our 2023 full year operating earnings guidance range of $5.19 to $5.39 with a $5.29 midpoint and long-term earnings growth rate is 6% to 7%. Given our line of sight at this point in the year, I believe we have the operational flexibility and leverage to pool to ensure that we will deliver on our commitment. Later on, Ann's going to talk or walk through our second quarter of 2023 performance drivers and share some perspectives on our load outlook as we drive economic development within our service territory. She'll also share some details supporting our targeted 14% to 15% FFO to debt range. While our FFO to debt is 11.1% this quarter, our forecasts show material improvement in this metric as we approach year-end and we fully expect to be in our targeted range in early 2024. As we continue to execute on our strategic objectives, we remain focused on simplifying and de-risking our business profile. To that end, you'll recall that in February of this year, we announced a signed agreement with IRG Acquisition Holdings for the sale of our 1,365 megawatt unregulated renewables portfolio. A summary of the renewable sale can be found on Slide 7. In the second quarter, we received FERC 203 approval and clearance from antitrust authorities. The only remaining approval is from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., which we expect to see receive in the near-term and subsequently close on the sale in August. As we've said, the proceeds from this transaction will be directed to our core regulated businesses and strengthening of our balance sheet. Turning to Slide 8, let's touch on some other asset sales that we have in progress. In May, 2023, we also announced the sale of our New Mexico Renewable Development Solar portfolio, also known as NMRD. We are currently on track with our 50/50 joint venture partner, PNM Resources to close on this transaction by the end of 2023. The sales of our retail and distributed resources businesses are also on schedule to close in the first half of 2024 as previously announced. Please keep in mind that other than the unregulated renewables portfolio proceeds of $1.2 billion, no other sales proceeds are reflected in our five year cash flow outlook. We\u2019ll first obtain the signed sales agreements for NMRD and our retail and distributed resources businesses, and then incorporate the related proceeds into our cash flow outlook. As part of our commitment to portfolio management, I\u2019m pleased to share some additional news with you today. We\u2019re announcing that we\u2019ve completed the strategic review of two of our three non-core transmission joint ventures and have determined that the sale of AEP\u2019s interest in Prairie Wind Transmission and Pioneer Transmission as our preferred path forward. We expect to launch the sales processes soon and we\u2019ll keep you updated on our progress. In the meantime, we continue our strategic review of Transource Energy and expect to complete that review by year end. Now let\u2019s switch gears to AEP\u2019s regulated renewables execution and recent successes. Through our five year $8.6 billion regulated renewables capital plan, we now have a total of $5.2 billion approved and an additional $1.7 billion currently before our commissions for approval. You can find more detail on activities to acquire additional generation resources in the appendix on Slides 31 through 33. In May 2023, the Oklahoma Commission approved PSO\u2019s 995.5 megawatt renewables portfolio for $2.5 billion, which includes three wind and three solar projects. These projects are projected to be in service toward the end of 2025. For SWEPCO\u2019s 999 megawatt renewables portfolio totaling $2.2 billion of investments, I\u2019m happy to report that last month, both the Arkansas and Louisiana Commissions approved the full portfolio containing two wind projects and one solar project. We expect the projects will be going into service by the 2025 timeframe. Since the Texas Commission denied SWEPCO\u2019s application related to these projects, Arkansas will move forward with the 20% of the portfolio total and Louisiana will flex up with 70% giving wholesale customers the remaining 10%. We\u2019re excited to deliver the benefits of lowest reasonable cost and reliable energy to these communities we serve in Arkansas and Louisiana. We\u2019re also currently awaiting for commission decisions expected as early as in the third quarter of 2023 for 151 megawatts of owned wind and energy storage at APCo, 469 megawatts of owned solar at I&M and 154 megawatts of owned wind at PSO. Importantly, our regulated renewables goals are aligned and supported by our integrated resources plans. Accordingly, we\u2019ve issued requests for proposals for generation resources at APCo and I&M with more to come from operating companies soon. I\u2019ll turn now to updates on several of our ongoing regulatory and legislative initiatives. More detail on our regulatory activities can be found in the appendix on Slides 34 through 36. We\u2019re unquestionably focused on closing the gap between our authorized versus earned ROEs. While our second quarter ROE came in at 8.6%, this measure was depressed by 40 basis points due to mild weather. Closing this gap is going to take a little longer than we had anticipated in our 2023 guidance, which you may recall included a 9.4% ROE. But I\u2019m confident that we\u2019ll reduce this gap by year end and still meet our earnings guidance. As we make needed progress in this regard, we are continuing to prioritize federal, state and customer preferences to meet the needs of our communities that we serve. We look forward to building on our constructive relationships with all of our stakeholders and clearing the path for our operating companies to be effective and successful in their respective service territories. In fact, while being mindful of any ex-parte restrictions, I\u2019m personally meeting with many commissioners across AEP\u2019s footprint to engage in discussions about our company and what is top of mind for them in the way of priorities and expectations as we work together to do our best to provide this product that is the fundamental enabler for society. In June 2023, we filed a new base case in Kentucky to address the financial health of the company and established a path for future investment. The application incorporated a comprehensive rate review and a proposed 9.9% ROE with a request to allow for the securitization of $471 million of regulatory assets. This will help to ensure that Kentucky Power is best positioned to provide safe and reliable service, while managing costs to provide affordable service to our customers. We expect that the new rates will be in effect in early 2024. In May 2023, we settled PSO\u2019s base case with the commission staff, attorney general and other parties in Oklahoma providing a path for approval for more efficient cost recovery mechanisms with continuation of the transmission tracker and reestablishment of a distribution tracker. While we await commission \u2013 a commission decision expected in the third quarter of 2023, we implemented interim rates starting in early June. For APCo Virginia\u2019s 2022 \u2013 2020 to 2022 triennial filed in March of 2023. We\u2019re working through regulatory \u2013 the regulatory calendar and expect an order later this year. And Texas legislation was passed last month, which permits utilities to file the Distribution Cost Recovery Factor or DCRF twice per year instead of once per year. The bill also allows DCRF to be used by a utility even if it has a pending base case review proceeding. This important legislation will help improve AEP\u2019s regulatory lag in Texas, as we make needed distribution investments to bolster the grid in this region. AEPs management of fuel cost recovery remains a top priority with deferred fuel balance at $1.4 billion as of the second quarter 2023. We\u2019ve adapted fuel cost recovery mechanisms across most of our jurisdictions with a focus on balancing customer impact. Notably, we are awaiting a decision on our fuel case in West Virginia. Through this spring we were active at the state legislature and collaborated on a new securitization bill to provide an effective path forward on fuel recovery and other legacy costs while mitigating customer bill impact. In April, 2023, \u2013 in our April, 2023 fuel recovery application, we filed two options for consideration, one which amortizes the fuel balance over three years, and alternatively, in an effort to even further minimize cost impacts to customers, we requested West Virginia Commission approval to use securitization to manage our $553 million deferred fuel balance. We also proposed an opportunity within that second option to apply the securitization mechanism to $88 million of deferred storm costs and $1.2 billion of legacy coal plant balances with the intention of offering a solution that would essentially have a neutral impact on customer rate. Keep in mind; securitization is the mechanism we can use to address affordability in West Virginia. While it\u2019s important that we addressed fuel and storm cost recovery in the state, let me be clear that the possible securitization of $1.2 billion for our Amos and Mountaineer coal plant balances is not required to hit our credit metrics, nor does it suggest that there\u2019s a change in our current plant \u2013 our current plant retirement schedule of 2040 for these units. Rather, this is entirely driven by the desire to consider all options to mitigate impact to customer bills. The West Virginia Commission subsequently issued a procedural schedule in the fuel case, including the April, 2023 prudence [ph] report, which will be addressed in an evidentiary hearing beginning on September 5. This schedule provides an opportunity to ensure focus on cost concerns and a constructive future in West Virginia balancing customer and financial impacts. Pending the commission\u2019s decision later this year, we could issue bonds to securitize a possible combination of the deferred fuel balance, deferred storm cost, and legacy coal plant balances in the first half of 2024. I\u2019m pleased with the progress we\u2019ve made so far. We still have a lot of work to do as we execute on our plans to meet our commitments, overcome challenges, reach our strategic objectives, engage with stakeholders, and keep customers a top priority. Together we deliver safe, clean, reliable, and affordable energy to our communities while creating value for our investors. With that, Ann will now walk you through our second quarter, 2023 performance drivers and details supporting our financial target. Ann? Ann Kelly : Thank you, Julie and Darcy. It\u2019s good to be with you all this morning. Thanks for dialing in. I\u2019m going to walk us through our second quarter and year-to-date results, share some updates on our service territory load and finish with commentary on credit metrics and liquidity, as well as some thoughts on our guidance, financial targets and portfolio management activities underway. Let\u2019s go to Slide 9, which shows the comparison of GAAP to operating earnings. GAAP earnings for the second quarter were a $1.01 per share compared to a $1.02 per share in 2022. Year-to-date GAAP earnings through June, were a $1.78 per share compared to $2.43 per share in 2022. In our year-to-date comparison of GAAP to operating earnings, we\u2019ve reflected the expected loss on the sale of the contracted renewables business as a non-operating cost, as well as an adjustment true of cost related to the terminated Kentucky transaction in addition to our typical mark-to-market adjustment. Also due to new legislation in Texas allowing the recovery of incentive compensation, favorable entry was booked in the second quarter to capitalize previously incurred costs, which was almost entirely reflected as non-operating earnings. There is a detailed reconciliation of GAAP to operating earnings on Pages 16 and 17 of the presentation today. Let\u2019s walk through our quarterly operating earnings performance by segment on Slide 10. Operating earnings for the second quarter totaled $1.13 per share or $582 million compared to a $1.20 per share, or $618 million in 2022. The lower performance compared to last year was primarily driven by weather, interest and O&M, partially offset by rate increases in our utility and transmission revenue growth in both our Utilities and the Transmission Holding Company segment. The unfavorable weather was largely due to positive weather we saw in the second quarter of 2022, while weather was mild begin in the second quarter of 2023; the unfavorable impact was less significant in comparison to the first quarter of this year. Interest continues to be unfavorable versus the prior year, and that is primarily driven by higher debt balances as well as the higher interest rates. The higher debt balance also has resulted in an increase in interest expense as compared to our guidance, but we continue to adjust in other areas to offset this impact. Again, we were expecting this variance to be more pronounced in the first half of 2023 as interest rates somewhat stabilized. We also expect the announced sale of our contracted renewables business to close this quarter and the conversion of the $850 million equity units in August to lessen the burden in the second half of the year. Finally, I\u2019d like to note as well that we still expect to see favorable O&M in the second half of the year compared to the prior year, reflecting the timing of O&M spending and near term actions that we are taking to help offset the unfavorable weather, such as holding positions open, reducing travel, and adjusting the timing and of discretionary spending. These actions are in addition to our ongoing efficiency efforts that we target to offset the impact of inflation each year. Operating earnings for our vertically integrated utilities were $0.51 per share, down $0.08. Favorable drivers included rate changes across multiple jurisdictions, depreciation and off-system sales. These items were more than offset by the unfavorable weather interest expense, O&M and lower retail and wholesale load. I will touch on our retail load trends in a couple minutes. Consistent with our first quarter results, depreciation is favorable at the vertically integrated utility segment, primarily due to the expiration of the Rockport Unit 2 lease in December of 2022. I&M should continue to see about $0.055 net favorable depreciation in each of the first three quarters of 2023, plus an additional $0.035 in Q4. Including the impact of the Rockport lease, depreciation was $0.04 favorable in Q2. However, if we exclude the impact of the lease, depreciation would've been about $0.02 unfavorable, which is consistent with the incremental investment in this segment. I also want to mention that the favorable off system sales showing up again in the second quarter is due to the fact that Rockport Unit 2 margins are no longer shared with our retail customers. The Transmission and Distribution Utilities segment earned $0.30 per share, down $0.02 compared to last year. Favorable drivers in this segment including transmission revenue and rate changes largely due to the distribution investment rider in Ohio and the distribution cost recovery factor rider in Texas. Offsetting these favorable items were unfavorable weather, lower retail load, depreciation, O&M and interest. The AEP Transmission Holdco segment contributed $0.38 per share up $0.11 compared to last year. The main drivers here included favorable investment growth and a favorable year-over-year change in the true-up. You'll recall that we had a negative true-up in 2022.  Generation & Marketing produced $0.13 per share down $0.05 from last year. The negative variance is primarily due to the development asset sale and other one-time favorable items in 2022 as well as higher interest expense in 2023. These unfavorable items were partially offset by higher retail power margins in 2023. Finally, corporate and other was down $0.03 per share, driven primarily by higher interest expense and O&M. These unfavorable items are partially offset by a favorable change in investment gain and income taxes. The favorable change in investment gain is primarily due to investment loss incurred in the second quarter of 2022. Before we move on to the next slide, to give an update on load, I want to briefly mention that the details of our year-to-date operating earnings performance will be shown in the appendix of supplemental information going forward. You can find these details on Slide 15 of the presentation today. Turning to Slide 11. I'll provide an update on our normalized load performance for the quarter. Overall load continues to come in ahead of budget, but we're closely monitoring key components of our retail sales in the context of the slowing economy, and we are seeing different trends between our retail customer classes. As we discussed last quarter, our projections already assume that economic conditions will slow in the second half of the year. Recent positive economic data on inflation supports that any slowdown will be in line with our previous expectations. Beginning in the upper left hand quadrant of the slide, we see a slowing in our residential load compared to a year ago. Our residential customer counts continue to grow, but we are seeing usage decline as many of our customers return to the office and even more squeezed by the relationship between inflation and income growth. That relationship is a key driver of residential usage and we expect to see it stabilize in the second half of the year. This month's CPI data point was an encouraging sign that inflationary pressures on our residential customers are continuing to lessen into the fall. Moving to the lower left hand quadrant of the slide, we can see a noticeable slowing in the industrial class. So still ahead of year end budget projections, industrial load is beginning to reflect the expected slowdown in the outlook for manufacturing across the country. This slowing has been broad based across industries and operating companies, but would've been even worse without an our ongoing commitment to economic development. We estimate that total industrial load through the quarter would've actually declined by 1.2% if not for growth tied to our economic development efforts. Even with these efforts, however, we do expect industrial load growth to remain subdued due to the tighter financial conditions and slowing levels of demand for finished goods through the end of the year. Offsetting this slowing is a significant boost to our normalized commercial sales that you can see in the upper right corner driven by new large customer volumes from our ongoing economic development efforts. Year-to-date commercial load has grown almost 8% year-over-year in each of the last two quarters. We expect our commercial load to continue to outperform through the end of the year. Thanks to ongoing technology development across our operating footprint. Gains in AEP Texas and AEP Ohio should continue to be especially robust with several new projects scheduled to come online through the end of the year. With the June CPI data, we've now seen a material deceleration in key components of inflation that the economy has been waiting to see. We think this progress on inflation coupled with continued resilience in the labor market dramatically reduces the probability of a severe economic contraction in 2023. Our near and long-term load projections are bolstered by our discipline commitment to economic development across the service area. We know that working with local stakeholders to attract more economic activity is a key strategy to providing value to our customers. This allows us to continue to prioritize investments that will improve customer experience while mitigating the rate impact on our customer base.  Great examples of our recent successes are NL and Tulsa and GM and Samsung in Indiana. Both of these economic development wins will not only add load to our industrial segment, but each is also expected to bring more than a 1,000 full-time jobs that will ultimately benefit our residential segment and boost the local economy. Let\u2019s move on to Slide 12 to discuss the company\u2019s capitalization and liquidity position. Taking a look at the upper left quadrant in the page, you can see our FFO to debt metric stands at 11.1%, which is a decrease of 30 basis points from last quarter and continues to be below our target. The primary reason for this decrease is a $1.3 billion increase in debt during the quarter, partially due to long-term debt issuances at the operating company level to support our capital investments and the return of mark-to-market collateral positions associated with decline in natural gas and power prices. Return of collateral reduces our funds from operations, so hits us on both sides of the equation without the fluctuations in our mark-to-market collateral positions over the past 12 months and some remaining impact of deferred fuel, our FFO to debt metric will be closer to 13.7%. We expect that this metric will improve by year end as we reduce debt after the close of the announced renewable sale and our 2020 equity unit conversion and we see the improvement in funds from operations over prior year in the fourth quarter. We remain committed to our targeted FFO to debt range of 14% to 15% and we expect material improvement by the end of 2023 and to achieve our target in early 2024. You can see our liquidity summary in the lower left quadrant of the slide. Our five-year $4 billion bank revolver and two-year $1 billion revolving credit facility support our liquidity position, which remains strong at $3.1 billion.  On a GAAP basis, our debt-to-capital ratio increased from the prior quarter by 50 basis points to 64.6%. We plan to reduce this percentage in the third quarter as we eliminate debt when we close our announced contracted renewable sale transaction and complete our previously planned equity unit conversion. On the qualified pension front, our funding status increased during the quarter to 102.2%. The funded status improved due to rising rates during the quarter that decrease the liability while solid equity returns positively impacted plan access. Let\u2019s go to Slide 13 for a quick recap of today\u2019s message. The unfavorable change in weather primarily due to positive effects in the second quarter of 2022 is a significant driver in our quarter-over-quarter earnings comparison. If we removed this effect, we would\u2019ve been $0.05 favorable compared to the prior year and our results were roughly in line with our expectations for the company as a whole. I will note from a year-to-date perspective 2023 weather has been the most mild on record for the AEP system in the past 30 years, resulting in $0.29 EPS impacts year-over-year and about $0.20 versus normal weather. So as we progress through the remainder of the year, we will continue to focus on taking action to mitigate this and other headwinds. Overall, our business remains in a strong position and we are reaffirming our operating earnings guidance of $5.19 to $5.39 per share. We also continue to be committed to our long-term growth rate of 6% to 7%. As Julie previously addressed, we are on track to close the sale of our unregulated contracted renewables portfolio in the third quarter this year, and our retail and distributed resources business in the first half of 2024. We\u2019ve concluded that the sale of our interest in two of our transmission joint ventures, Prairie Wind Transmission and Pioneer Transmission is our preferred path, and we continue a strategic review of our Transource Energy joint venture. These initiatives will help simplify and de-risk our business going forward. We really appreciate your time and attention today and with that and going to ask Brad to open the call, that we can hear what\u2019s on your mind and answer any questions that you have. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Give us just a moment here. And I can go to Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead. Shar Pourreza : Hey, good morning guys. Julie Sloat : Good morning. Shar Pourreza : Good morning. Just on the credit metrics, obviously, a little bit more slippage this quarter, which you highlighted. I guess can you talk about the pathway to get to that 14% to 15%, a little bit more detail? I think 300 basis points seems like a lot of improvement that\u2019s needed in a short timeframe, being that it\u2019s your early 2024 target. I mean, could we see incremental equity in plan? Is the asset sales enough to get you there? And how important is collecting the unrecovered fuel balance in terms of being able to hit that target, which I guess it still stands around $1.4 billion. Thanks. Ann Kelly : Yes. Shar, I\u2019ll take that. As we mentioned, the main impact to our FFO to debt is the timing of the collateral payment. So that\u2019s about a 240 basis point impact to our FFO to debt, and so that should resolve itself by year end and result in a noticeable improvement. We also have about a 100 basis points of favorable impact from the proceeds of the contracted renewable sale and the equity unit conversion. So we are, confident that we are going to have measure improvement by the end of the year and be into the range by next year. In our forecast we don\u2019t have any of the securitization in our cash flows. We do have recovery of deferred fuel, but that is not necessary to be able to get into our current range. Shar Pourreza : Got it. Okay, perfect. And then maybe just a more of a strategic question for Julie. I mean, obviously, AEP is never CapEx constrained, right? I guess how do we sort of think about overall financing, especially given the current interest rate environment and kind of where the stock currently trades? Do you have ongoing; you do have ongoing needs, right? So as we\u2019re thinking about parent leverage and equity are more non-core asset sales out there, or could we actually start to see some more core assets sales to kind of fund the plan and maybe further simplify the story? Thanks Julie Sloat : Yes, no, Shar. I so appreciate the question. And you\u2019re right, we have a lot of opportunity to put capital to work as it relates to taking care of the customer and delivering reliable, affordable service. But as you point out, we need to make sure that we\u2019re hitting all the metrics too. So not only do you need to be real mindful of where customer rates are going, when we put money to work, I need to make sure that all my earnings growth targets are going to be hit. Because I think you guys would be upset with me if that didn\u2019t happen, so we\u2019ll make sure that happens. But I also need to make sure that my balance sheet\u2019s really strong too. So let me get to your question around asset sales. We\u2019ve really been focused on, as you know, the non-core related activities that when people buy AEP shares or invest in our bonds, they\u2019re not necessarily looking to buy something that is not a traditional regulated utility type business. So to that end, that\u2019s why you see us kind of going through the paces today where we\u2019ve talked about the unregulated components of our business and, while we love transmission even looking at some of these transmission investments of the joint ventures that are off our footprint, because if we can channel all of our efforts and dollars to taking care of our customers that are regulated in our footprint, that\u2019s where we want to play. So, I wouldn\u2019t anticipate, a significant additional activity coming from us for a couple of reasons. I think we\u2019re pretty cleaned up once we get some of this non-core stuff taken care of. I think we\u2019re in a good place. I think that, there may be some opportunities, on the edges, but for the most part we\u2019re \u2013 we should be in a really good space to be continuing to look at the regulated pieces of our business. But we also and very candid Shar, we don\u2019t need to engage in asset sales to make the balance sheet work. What we need to do is make sure we\u2019re being as efficient as possible, and that\u2019s another reason why I want to make sure that every dollar we do put to work is one that a, makes sense for our customers, but also is something that makes sense for our service territories. And specifically why I am calling that out is another reason why I\u2019m out talking with folks in our community. So whether its commissioners, customers, et cetera, need to make sure that we\u2019re aligned or at least absolutely aware of one another\u2019s priorities and then we can make refinements based on those conversations. So, I would never say that we\u2019re not at all capital constraints because I think we naturally are because we put our own constraints on because we got to take care of customer rates and make sure that we\u2019re going to have a really strong balance sheet. We\u2019re working on that. As Ann just mentioned, we expect that FFO to debt to look a lot better once we get to year end and going into 2024. I think in the interim here, it\u2019s going to be just a little bumpy as we work through a couple of the next few months. So I wouldn\u2019t be too concerned about that. I feel comfortable with the numbers I\u2019m seeing, but we\u2019ll continue to be very disciplined around, which dollars we put to work where that it\u2019s consistent with what our stakeholders need and want taking care of our customer and then just being as efficient as we can. So my focus is going to be more at this point on let\u2019s close that gap on the ROE. That\u2019s the piece that I can try to do my best to control. Shar Pourreza : Got it, terrific. And then no, it does. And then we do appreciate some of the salient points you brought up in your prepared remarks as far as the outreach to the regulatory folks and various stakeholders. So thank you for that points. Julie Sloat : Yep. Thank you for the coverage. Operator : And next we go to Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Jeremy Tonet : Hi, good morning. Julie Sloat : Good morning. Jeremy Tonet : I wanted to kind of follow up on some of the points that you were just touching on here because, some of the dockets and local media attention have highlighted some regulatory pushback in certain areas of ablate, and you mentioned, reaching out to local commissioners to build relations there. Just wondering over what timeframe, you expect to kind of meet all of them? Is this a change in regulatory strategy where they hear from headquarters more regularly here? Just wondering how you think about this type of outreach going forward? Julie Sloat : Oh, Jeremy, I love that question. So I\u2019m going to tell you from my perspective, this is coming from a former operating company president. So I keep that hat kind of in my back pocket that I got to throw on from time to time. And so let me start with this. What my hope to do, well I, what I hope to do or achieve is, pay [ph] the way or clear the path for our operating companies so that they can do the best they can do boots on the ground. And so my objective is to get out, to make sure that I\u2019m talking with different commissioners. And by the way, that\u2019s already underway. So, I\u2019ve already been out talking with several folks and I\u2019ve got my calendar lined up over the next few months to continue to that effort. So I\u2019m not going to get into necessarily exactly who I\u2019m talking to when, but that, that\u2019s well underway. So rest assured that\u2019s happening. But I just, I want to make sure that they\u2019re hearing from me and that they understand that AEP, the parent or the service core is here to provide clearance and service and support for the individual operating companies. Really, that\u2019s the only reason the service core exists, is to support the operating companies. And I need them to hear that from me. And more importantly I just want to be a really good listener so that I can be really good at my job so I can take care of our customers, take care of my team, and then ultimately take care of my investors and the other stakeholders that are party to everything that we're doing here. So I don't want people to think that I'm stepping in the way or thinking that something's not right because that's not the case at all. I just want to make sure that we're doing everything we can to support the teams so that they can be as successful as they possibly can be. Because here's the other point, right. You call out the fact that there are pressure points as it relates to regulatory activities. I think that's going to be what we're dealing with for the next several years. We got a lot of headwinds now. The game's changed, the industry's going through a material transition. Each of our states is in a different place as it relates to their economies. And so I think everybody is doing their jobs and that means we got to do ours too. We have been doing it, but we have to be really good listeners and learners and adjusters. And I think that goes for all the different stakeholders. So the more dialogue we can have, I think the smarter we're going to be and if nothing else that will \u2013 we only be able to take care of the customer and make sure we're keeping the lights on and delivering this product that make life possible. But I think we're going to be doing it in a much more effective way, and we're going to have to pick up the pace too. So we got to do it in a faster way than we've ever done it in our history. So I think it's exciting. I love getting out and talking with people. You guys know from The Street, I love getting out and talking with you too, so that's not going to stop. So I just got to work my calendar and I'll be out front and I'm happy to talk about any of the conversations that I've had. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. That's very helpful. And just one more along these lines, dialing in a little bit more. In Kentucky, our local stakeholder conversations highlight a focus on increased distribution investment as a priority as opposed to the more recent, I guess, transmission investment which could help local stakeholder relations there with a focus on distribution. Just wondering how you see a Kentucky strategy evolving over time here? Julie Sloat : Yes, I'll tell you, let me start with this. Again, having been a former CFO as well. At 1.6% ROE, yes, we got to work on that. And that to me, when I see that number that's not a financially healthy, sustainably healthy entity so that's why we're going through the case activities. So we're going to work on that and that's exactly why we went out and socialized the case well in advance with dozens of meetings with a variety of different stakeholders. So again, listening and learning so we understand where everybody's kind of shaken out, but also understanding what it is that we need to do so that we're successful, not only in taking care of our customers, but making sure we're doing everything we can to make sure that the stakeholders understand what our objectives are and are comfortable with it. So yes, the objective is to, A, get a plan in place that will allow us to improve the financial positioning of the company, which then enables us to make future investments to take care of the customers, they need the power too. It doesn't matter which state you're sitting in, but the idea is to engage in these activities, hopefully have a really good case. And I don't expect it to be easy. It's not supposed to be easy. If it was easy, everybody would be doing it. So we'll engage in those activities and hopefully get us on a path forward that enables us to continue to invest in a really smart way in the state that everybody can feel good about. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. So there's room to pivot towards more distribution over transmission. Sounds like you're working with stakeholders there? Julie Sloat : We, absolutely and so those are the conversations that we're having. We do know that transmission has been very important to the commission. And so that is top of mind for us as well. And we've worked that into the structures that we've essentially set forth in our case. But at the end of the day, it's the distribution that also matters because we got to keep the lights on. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. I'll leave it there. Thank you very much. Julie Sloat : You bet. Thank you. Operator : And next, we'll move to Anthony Crowdell with Mizuho. Please go ahead. Anthony Crowdell : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Julie Sloat : You bet. Anthony Crowdell : Just \u2013 first off, Slide 12, maybe I've been following it too long, but I think over the last 10 years, the total debt to total capitalization has gone from 53%. Now it sits at 65%. I'm just wondering, does that stabilize or where do you see the sweet spot for total debt to total capitalization? Ann Kelly : Yes, absolutely. Thanks for the question. So it has inched up, as you can see on the graph. I mean, 60% is our sweet spot and that's what we're targeting going forward. As you can see, we're above that right now. We do expect that to decrease with the contracted renewable sale proceeds and also the equity unit conversion. So that's a couple hundred basis points, that'll reduce that closer to the 60%, but we still have some work to do. Anthony Crowdell : Great. And then if I stayed on the balance sheet here, I think you've talked about, you've planned to be in a target, and I hope this correct in 2024. If I could get real granular, when do you think you're going to get into the midpoint of your 14% to 15% range? Is that something you'd talk about? Julie Sloat : Yes, I mean, I would say we're going to be, we say we're going to be in the target in 2024 and I think approaching the midpoint probably by the end of 2024. There are the fluctuations as I mentioned in FFO that we're experiencing. And that's just really due to timing of quarter-over-quarter fund flows. And so, you will see especially in 2023 that it will be press till the fourth quarter when we really see that switch in the collateral collections and improving our FFO there, so that's what's going to take some time. But we do expect it to increase, like I said, materially by the fourth quarter and then into next year. And Anthony, just to put a little finer point on it too, remember, our threshold that we're sensitive to is 13% as it relates to our Baa2 rating from Moody's. And so that's why we toggle to the 14% to 15% because what we want to have is cushion. So 14% definitely gives us some cushion, so keep that in mind as well. And the other thing I mentioned in my comments too is as we proceed through the rest of this year, you can expect maybe a little more pressure as we go through the next couple of months with some improvement as we get to the fourth quarter. Just want to manage those expectations. Ann Kelly : Yes. The other thing just to highlight is that, we're talking a lot about the timing of collateral payments, but 80% of that volatility that we're seeing relates to our retail business, which as you know, is for sale. So once we sell that business, we would expect that reduction in volatility going forward. Anthony Crowdell : And then just lastly, Julie, I appreciate all the commentary you've given on the regulatory strategy and especially Kentucky. And I know Kentucky's a very small piece, but when you look at the equalizer chart, I mean the ROE is pretty low. What\u2019s a reasonable assumption for us to use? Where that ROE could go in 20 \u2013 by 2024? I mean, does that go to an allowed of 9.9%? I\u2019m just curious, how long does it take to recover the regulated returns of the utility? Julie Sloat : Yes, Anthony, it\u2019s going to take a while. Do not expect a flash cut. And so remember in our case, we requested a 9.9% ROE, our current authorized is 9.3%. I\u2019m looking at Page number 34 in the slide deck right now. It will be a walk. So that\u2019s something we\u2019re trying to manage our own expectations around as well as for you all, as you work to model. So stay tuned and let this case proceed and see how things move along and then we can continue to kind of dial that in and give you more direct guidance. Anthony Crowdell : Great. Thanks so much for taking my questions. I really appreciate it. Julie Sloat : You bet. Thanks for being on the call. Operator : And we can go to Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Thank you Julie and team. Good morning. Appreciate it. Maybe to follow-up on some of the last few questions here, if I can. Just as you think about some of these headwinds here with respect to securitization heading into 2024, obviously you down fairly confident, not just in offsetting the weather year today, but in the 2024 items here. Can you talk about some of those tailwinds here or some of the forthcoming offsets? What else gives you the confidence in having that linear trajectory on the 6% to 7% here? If you can speak to that a little bit more. And maybe related to that, can you talk about maybe the timing of some of these items to the extent, which some of those headwinds on securitization bleed into 2025 as well? I don\u2019t want to be too myopic on the next year. Ann Kelly : Yes. I mean, what I\u2019ll do is I\u2019ll start with kind of addressing the 2023 earnings guidance question. As you look, we\u2019re $0.18 below prior year and we guided to year-over-year for the full year it\u2019s about $0.20 improvement. So that\u2019s $0.38 that we need to outperform last year for the second half of the year. When I look at this, I think it\u2019s helpful to break it down into components. So weather was $0.29 over 2022, about $0.20 of that impact is versus normal. And that\u2019s where we\u2019ve taken some action to offset those headwinds. Interest also is about $0.29 unfavorable year-to-date. It\u2019s running a bit above expectations. We had guided to $0.20, but that also didn\u2019t include interest on Kentucky, because we had expected to sell the business. So that\u2019s about $0.10 per year and that\u2019s covered in revenue. So we had anticipated much of our year-over-year increase to be in the first half of the year because of the timing of the Fed actions. So while we are a little bit short coming into the back half of the year, we also have the proceeds from the contracted renewable sale and equity unit conversion that\u2019ll help reduce our debt somewhat. And we\u2019ve taken other actions to offset the increase in rates because it has been \u2013 the Fed has been tightening a little bit longer. When you look at O&M, unfavorable to last year in the first half, but we expect this to reverse due to timing of our O&M spending. Our original guidance planned for reduction of O&M during the second half of the year because last year\u2019s spending was a little bit robust on the O&M side in the back half. And so we had already anticipated a reduction and then we\u2019ve taken additional actions like those that I\u2019ve mentioned to be able to make up for the reduction in weather volumes. And then lastly, there\u2019s a couple other things that we\u2019re pointing to. One is the favorable trends in commercial load that we expect to continue. And then we\u2019ve also seen favorable results in our generation and marketing business that\u2019ll benefit us this year. So, putting that all together that what give us the confidence and our ability to meet our earnings guidance for this year. In terms of maintaining the 6% to 7% EPS growth going forward, it\u2019s really a story on our capital deployment and we have a very robust capital pipeline that allows us to do just that. Julie Sloat : And Julien, on that note, just to kind of put an end cap on this. I think the core is solid. And so when you look out in the next few years, as Ann mentioned, we got $40 billion we\u2019re put into work in terms of capital investment over the next five years. We\u2019ll continue to work with our regulators to make sure that we\u2019re deploying the dollars where we all agree that they need to go. And then at that point it\u2019s really around making sure that we also execute on not only the regulatory plans that we lay out there, but as you know, we\u2019ve got some strategic asset sales that are underway. So we\u2019ll deal with the fact that some of those businesses are falling away, rechanneling those dollars to the regulated pieces of the business that will help us from the math perspective and making sure that we\u2019re hitting all of those other balance sheet metrics that we need to make sure that we hit, so people aren\u2019t worried or concerned. And we got a little more flexibility. So when we have a weather event or something of that nature, we can easily sustain that. But the core is solid and at this point it\u2019s around being efficient, putting the dollars to work where it makes sense and closing the gap on the ROEs. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. All right. Excellent. And then if I could follow-up briefly on a couple details. Just with respect to PSO, obviously dynamic situation with the ALJ and settlement, can you talk a little bit about your expectations here and maybe about what you had been planning in interim rates? Just ultimately what happens, how you\u2019ve been planning, what\u2019s reflected in rates? If you don\u2019t mind a little bit of an update there. Julie Sloat : Yes. So we implemented interim rates in early June I think it was, as it relates to the settlement that we had put in place. And at this point, as you mentioned, the ALJ had its report that it is submitted and then file \u2013 exceptions were filed, I think it was yesterday to the ALJ report. So if you haven\u2019t taken a look at that I would encourage you to take a look at that. But effectively the parties to the settlement agreement were absolutely supportive of the settlement agreement, which we would\u2019ve expected anyway. So we felt good about that. And we\u2019re going to let this thing play out over the next couple of weeks really, because we\u2019re getting pretty close here. Parties have four days to response the exceptions that were filed. And that is effectively August 1st. And then we will have an oral argument of the exceptions that\u2019s scheduled for mid-August and we would expect to get an order in September. So stay tuned. The process is working and like I mentioned, we\u2019ve got inter rate \u2013 interim rates in effect. And we will keep you apprised, but do go take a look at the exceptions. I thought that was interesting. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Duly noted. Thank you. All right, I\u2019ll leave it there. Good luck guys. Speak to you soon. Julie Sloat : Excellent. Thanks, Julien. Operator : Next we\u2019ll go to David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. David Arcaro : Hey, good morning. Thanks for the questions. Julie Sloat : Good morning. David Arcaro : Wanted to, let\u2019s see \u2013 could you give some color on what your plans are going forward for Texas in terms of the generation outlook you\u2019ve had some challenges there just with the repeat renewables proposal. I\u2019m wondering how you\u2019re thinking about that going forward in terms of strategy and generation pollution? Julie Sloat : Yes, absolutely. Yes. So we did file for rehearing, because we need to make sure that we\u2019re doing all we need to do from a traditional regulatory and administrative perspective. And then what you can anticipate AEP doing is essentially running another RFP and running another process so that we can make sure that we\u2019re doing what we need to accommodate the capacity situation in Texas. I do believe that Texas understands there is an adequacy issue that we would otherwise have to deal with. So that\u2019s something that we will be proceeding forward with. So standby and you\u2019ll see what we come to the street with here in the not too distant future. David Arcaro : Got it. And could there be a cell phone [ph] option in there? And to the extent there was, would that be, I guess, incremental to what\u2019s currently in the renewable generation outlook for CapEx plan? Julie Sloat : Yes, that\u2019s a possibility. That\u2019s a possibility. But what we would do is, accommodate any type of investment in the current CapEx forecast. David Arcaro : Okay. Got it. Understood. And then you do have a couple other renewable projects out there for approval this quarter in several states. I was just wondering if you could give a sense of your confidence level in those before the proposals that you\u2019ve put forth and what alternatives you might have if there end up being challenges in any of those? Julie Sloat : Yes, and actually I\u2019m trying to flip the page so we can kind of draw everyone\u2019s attention to them. Right now, I\u2019m looking at Page 32. So for example, we\u2019ve got an application open in Virginia and we made the same filing in West Virginia. For Appalachian Power Company, we\u2019re talking about 151 megawatts, about a $500 million investment for wind and storage capacity there. At this point the process is proceeding along as we would expect. So, I have nothing new to report.  So, standby there. And trying to think of where else we have open cases in Indiana, Michigan. Looks like staff has been supportive on the Michigan side, through those applications. And Indiana order is expected in 3Q, so the third quarter of this year. So stay tuned there as well. But so far constructive and productive and we\u2019re moving forward. Then of course we also have, I guess I should call out the wind out \u2013 the Wind investment Rock Falls that\u2019s included in the base case at PSO. But that\u2019s part of the base case settlement. So as you know, I just mentioned that we\u2019re well underway in that proceeding. David Arcaro : Got it. Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks so much. Julie Sloat : Thank you. Operator : And we can go to Sophie Karp with KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Sophie Karp : Hi. Good morning and thank you for taking my questions. I have a couple of questions here. First is on the renewables, right? So clearly Texas maybe has lesser appetite for renewables at this point. And I\u2019m just curious if you how much of the incremental appetite for this do you think is left in Louisiana and like other states that picked up slack in this particular instance? Is there risk in the near term, I guess in your mind, that those states would also turn down potential future proposals because of their perception that they have? They\u2019re pretty much like full as far as renewable generation goes. Julie Sloat : Sophie, I appreciate that question very much, because as you know, that\u2019s been top of mind for us as we worked through that proceeding. So, we obviously got the approval for the 999 megawatts and Louisiana flexed up, so we\u2019re moving along in that regard. You may recall that we also had another process that was underway for SWEPCO in particular, I want to say it was 2,400 megawatts that we were seeking interest in as it relates to how we would put that portfolio together. And so what we\u2019ve done is, we\u2019ve actually tabled that and we\u2019ll be coming back to everyone to say, look, we want to look at this from an all source perspective, including PPAs. So stay tuned on that because there is absolutely a capacity need. It\u2019s just going to take a little different shape than what we were initially expecting as we were running that RFP process. And remember when you probably heard me saying earlier here today on the call; we need to make sure that we\u2019re listening to our regulators. And so this is exactly what we\u2019re doing as it relates to the conversation and the experience that we just had in Louisiana, Arkansas, and Texas. And so we are adjusting and moving forward. So there will be more RFPs stay tuned for that. And they will be more all source oriented, no different than what we would be doing in Texas as you call out. Yeah, it looks like not a lot of interest in renewables there right now. So we need to think about what the other alternatives are, but we will work together with our regulators so that we can make sure that we\u2019re doing what the state needs. Because at the end of the day, this is all about making sure that our customers have reliable, affordable electricity period. Ann Kelly : Yes. And just to reiterate on our capital plan, so far $5.2 billion of projects have already been approved and we have another $1.7 billion that, that Julie just talked about in the regulatory process that\u2019s out of our $8.6 billion. So we are well on our way and we also have flexibility with our transmission and distribution investments to fill in to the extent that anything else gets delayed a little bit in the process with these RFPs. Sophie Karp : Great, great. Thank you. My other question was in the ROEs, maybe I\u2019m referencing Slide 34 here, my reading this right, that the 40 bps \u2013 depressed by 40 bps per mild weather is sort of average across the board. So if it wasn\u2019t for weather, all of these bubbles would be like roughly 40 bps higher or how should we think about this? There\u2019s like a lot of numbers here. Ann Kelly : Yes. That 40 bps is on average. Okay. So let me answer it this way though, because when I\u2019m thinking about what does this mean for the rest of the year, and as I mentioned in my opening comments, we had initially anticipated or expected on a weighted average basis. We'd be about a 9.4% ROE across our operating companies in our 2023 guidance. And so now what we're suggesting is now that we have a little bit of a hole that is associated with weather on that ROE can't make all that up, I don't think, unless we had some ridiculous weather circumstance in the back half of this year. So we're not going to bet on that because we're going to bet on normal. And so what I would expect is we expect to improve from 8.6%, it will not get to that 9.4%. So even if you get closer to 9%, I think that's reasonable. And our point that we want to make today is despite the fact that we've had pressure as a result of weather, we're adjusting the sales and we fully well expect to be within our guidance range. And so that's the important key to take away today as it relates to our messaging. Then with also the understanding behind the scenes we just need to fundamentally do our very best to make sure we're earning as close as possible to those authorized ROEs beyond the weather situation. Sophie Karp : Got it. So just to be clear, the 8.6% is the average with the Transmission Holdco? Julie Sloat : Yes. Sophie Karp : Of all distribution\u2026 Julie Sloat : Weighted average. Yes. Sophie Karp : Okay. Got it. Julie Sloat : Thank you. You bet. Ann Kelly : Thank you. Operator : And next we go to Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead. Julie Sloat : Hey, Paul. Paul Patterson : [Indiscernible] I'm managing. So just \u2013 most of my questions have been answered. Only I have a question for you that's a little bit different and that is the Chevron's defense. It looks like that know that the Supreme Court might act on it. And I'm kind of scratching my head and I was thinking what you guys might be thinking about what might happen if in fact, the Chevron doctrine or whatever you want to call it is substantially changed or were repealed or what have you. Do \u2013 have you guys thought about this or I'm sure you've thought about it, but any ideas about what you think that might mean for you guys on the ground? Julie Sloat : Paul, I don't have a lot of detail to share with you today. I do know that our legal team is looking into this and our strategy team. But for my day to day right now at the moment, not been top of mind I'm just taking comfort knowing that the rest of the team's working on it. But hey, if you have a conversation, I'm happy to circle back. Paul Patterson : Okay, sure. Julie Sloat : Yes. Paul Patterson : It was my first question, but the rest were answered, so thanks so much and I'll follow up with you guys later. Julie Sloat : That'd be great. Thank you. Paul Patterson : Okay, great. Thank you Operator : We'll go to Paul Fremont with Ladenburg. Please go ahead. Paul Fremont : Thank you very much. I guess my first question is if you were to get the securitization proceeds, does that change the equity issuance plans that you lay out on Slide 28? Julie Sloat : No. No, it really doesn't. So if we get the securitization proceeds, what we would do is reinvest that into the other areas within the AEP footprint. So not in APCo but in the other areas so that we're in making sure that we continue to earn on the investment while getting the benefits to the Appalachian Power customers. Paul Fremont : And then my second question sort of related is if you were to get incremental CapEx, what percent should we assume would be equity funded versus let's say debt funded? Julie Sloat : Yes, I mean I would assume just kind of the average of what we have in the current plant. Yes, Paul, we typically get, if we have an opportunity to invest more we're going to try to manage directly back to those target ratios that we throw out there and obviously be mindful of debt to cap as well. So at this point, we're focused entirely on executing on the plant that we already have out in front of you. The issue could be from time to time is how much slides from one year to the next. So you're kind of playing with the toothpaste tube, right? So you're just on passing the CapEx back and forth, because we got $40 billion that we're put into work. And again, at this point, while we always have more opportunities we need to make sure that this is affordable for our customers as well. So that's going to be another stopping point for us too because we're essentially trying to thread the needle, make sure the balance sheet stays strong, make sure those metrics are absolutely in place, but make sure that, our customers are able to afford what we're essentially providing. Our regulators definitely help us with that, but that's also precisely why we have to be really disciplined and not just continuing to spend CapEx that would be fun and nice to spend and actually absolutely make our system stronger and absolutely reliable. But is that what is necessary to keep the lights on and what customers can afford. So it is a constant balancing act for us. Paul Fremont : Great. Thank you very much. Julie Sloat : You bet. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Darcy Reese : Thank you for joining us on today's call. As always, IR team will be available to answer any additional questions you may have.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the American Electric Power Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the call over to Darcy Reese, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Darcy Reese : Thank you, Eric. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the third quarter 2023 earnings call for American Electric Power. We appreciate you taking time today to join us. Our earnings release, presentation slides and related financial information are available on our website at AEP.com. Today, we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors.  Joining me this morning for opening remarks are Julia Sloat, our Chair, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Chuck Zebula, our Chief Financial Officer. We will take your questions following their remarks. I will now turn the call over to Julie. Julia Sloat : Thanks, Darcy. Welcome to American Electric Power's third quarter 2023 earnings call. It's good to be with everyone this morning. Before I discuss our third quarter performance, I would like to introduce our CFO, Chuck Zebula, who will walk us through the results today. Chuck has been with the company for 25 years and has a deep understanding of our business. He hit the ground running in his new role, and we're grateful for his leadership. Many of you are familiar with Chuck, and I'm confident that you enjoy working with him in the CFO role.  I'm pleased to share that the execution of our strategy is on track. AEP is well positioned to deliver on a robust and flexible 5-year $40 billion capital plan with an emphasis on our generation fleet transformation and investments in our energy delivery infrastructure as we need our customer needs. While our industry continues to transform amid this dynamic environment characterized by more extreme weather, rising interest rates and supply chain constraints, AEP has continued to adapt and take thoughtful actions to stay our course. We're keeping the customer at the center of every decision we make, while also balancing and listening to our stakeholders who are critical to our success.  This quarter, we made progress on our ongoing efforts to simplify and derisk our business profile through portfolio management, directing all proceeds of those efforts to the regulated business and to balance sheet management, which I'll speak to in more detail in a moment. We've also been working hard on the regulatory front. I'll provide insight into our success in the addition of renewable store portfolio and the many positive developments on regulatory and legislative initiatives. A summary of our third quarter 2023 business updates can be found on Slide 6 of today's presentation. AEP reported strong third quarter operating earnings of $1.77 per share or $924 million. We have a flexible business plan that allows us to deliver on our financial commitments while taking into account mild weather in the first half of the year and the higher for longer interest rate environment. As we actively manage the business today, we're narrowing our guidance for 2023 full year operating earnings to a range of $5.24 to $5.34 while reaffirming the $5.29 midpoint and our long-term earnings growth rate of 6% to 7%. Moreover, last week, we announced an increase in our dividend, which is consistent with our earnings growth rate and within our targeted payout ratio of 60% to 70%. In a few minutes, Chuck will talk about the support we have for our narrow 2023 earnings guidance range, which includes O&M management and positive load outlook as we drive economic development within our service territory. While our FFO to debt was 11.4% this quarter, we expect that this metric will improve materially by year-end and fall within the targeted rate of 14% to 15% in early 2024. Chuck will also touch on the short path to this balance sheet target.  We continue to make progress in our efforts to simplify and derisk our portfolio. In August, we announced the completion of the sale of our 1,365 megawatt unregulated renewables portfolio to IRG acquisition Holdings, which resulted in after-tax proceeds totaling $1.2 billion. A summary of this sale can be seen on Slide 7.  We've also made headway on some of our other asset sales that we previously discussed. A summary of this can be referenced on Slide 8. In May, we announced the sale of our New Mexico renewable development solar portfolio, also known as NMRD. The book value of AP's investment as of September 30 was $119 million. We're currently on track with our 550 joint venture partner, PNM Resources, as we target to close on this transaction in the late fourth quarter of this year or early first quarter of next.  We expect to continue the noncore business sales processes we have underway as we enter 2024. The sales of our retail and distributed resources businesses were launched in August with book value of $244 million and $353 million, respectively, as of the end of the third quarter. We expect to reach a sale agreement in the first quarter of next year with an anticipated closing in the first half of 2024. In July, we announced the sales of Prairie Wind transmission and Pioneer Transmission, our noncore transmission joint ventures, as of the end of the third quarter, AEP's portion of rate base associated with these investments was $107 million. We expect to launch the sales process soon and close in 2024.  Finally related to , while there are no new updates for now. We anticipate completing the strategic review by the end of this year. So please stay tuned. AEP portion of rate base for this particular investment joint venture was $348 million as of quarter end. Let me shift gears and provide you with an update on our regulated renewables investment plan. The teams remain focused and made solid progress. As you know, we have $8.6 billion of regulated renewables in our 5-year capital plan. We now have a total of $6 billion of the investment plan approved and an additional $800 million currently before commissions for approval with each of these projects providing valuable fuel savings for our customers. More detail on our renewable resource additions can be viewed in the appendix on Slides 32 through 34. As we've previously disclosed, both PSO's 995.5-megawatt renewable portfolio for $2.5 billion and SWEPCO's 999-megawatt renewable portfolio over $2.2 billion were approved earlier this year. At a collective $4.7 billion, these two portfolios alone comprise a large component of the approved $6 billion amount I just mentioned.  Additionally, in APCo service territory, we're also pleased to report a positive development. In September, Virginia approved 143 megawatts of owned wind for more than $400 million, building upon APCo's existing 29 megawatts of wind and solar projects that were approved last year, which totaled approximately $500 million.  Moving across our service territory to I&M, we filed to seek approval for recovery of two investment -- of investment in two owned solar projects totaling 469 megawatts, which represents $1 billion of total investment. We're making progress on this front as we received commission approval last month in Indiana for both the 224-megawatt May Apple and 245-megawatt Lake Trout solar projects. In Michigan the Commission approved May Apple back in August, and we'll decide on Lake Trout in the first quarter of next year.  We also await a commission order expected any time now for the 154-megawatt rock balls wind farm at PSO for approximately $150 million. Importantly, our regulated renewables plants are aligned with and supported by our integrated resource plans. We have issued a request for proposals for additional owned resources at APCo and IM with more to come from other operating companies in the near future as we listen and learn and respond to state preferences. Now I'd like to turn to updates on our ongoing regulatory and legislative initiatives. We've been engaged in efforts across our service territory to close the authorized versus earned ROE gap. Our third quarter ROE came in at 8.7%, driven in part by the unfavorable weather in the first half of 2023 that I mentioned earlier, which depressed this measure by 40 basis points. While this is a modest improvement over the last quarter, we are aware that more can be done and more needs to be done on this front. Closing the gap will remain a primary focus into 2024 as we take federal state and customer preferences top of mind, along with meeting the needs of our communities. We remain focused on reducing the gap going into year-end, while still meeting our earnings guidance. To that end, I'm happy to confirm that we have settlement in place for APCo Virginia's 2020 to 2022 triennial and APO Ohio's ESP5, both cases which were filed earlier this year. we're awaiting commission decisions in these states and Virginia's orders expected in the fourth quarter of this year and Ohio will likely be issued in the first quarter of 2024. In addition, we filed new base cases in Indiana and Michigan in the third quarter. Both filings we requested -- in both on we requested a 10.5% ROE and taste drivers included distribution investment in technology, enhanced reliability and grid modernization using 2024 forecast and test years. We anticipate the new rates will be an effective next year.  The team has been active on the legislative front in Texas -- with Texas legislation pass and June allowing utilities to file the distribution cost recovery factor mechanism or DCRF twice per year, sit of once per year. This legislation also allows the DCRF mechanism to be used by utility, even if it has a pending rate case for seating underway. Consequently, the legislation will help improve AEP's regulatory lag in Texas to the tune of approximately 50 basis points and earned ROE starting in 2024. In fact, our April 2023 DCRF filing was approved and rates went into effect in September. For Kentucky Power, our June 2023 based base application incorporated the comprehensive rate review, a 9.9% ROE and a request to allow for the securitization of $471 million of regulatory assets, ensuring Kentucky Power is best positioned to provide safe and reliable service while managing costs. Constructive intervener testimony was filed in October, including support for securitization. By statute, implementation of interim rates is permissible in January 2024.  Moving to PSO, you'll recall that in May, we reached a settlement with the commission staff, the attorney general and other parties in Oklahoma's PSO base case, which included a 9.5% ROE and provided for approval for more efficient cost recovery mechanisms. We implemented interim rates in June while we await a commission order, which is expected any time now. As you know, the management of fuel cost recovery is a top priority with AP's deferred fuel balance across our vertically integrated utilities shrinking sequentially and totaling $1.2 billion as of the end of the third quarter of this year. We have worked with stakeholders to intentionally adapt our fuel cost recovery mechanisms across our jurisdictions with the objective being to balance cost recovery with customer impact. So West Virginia fuel proceeding is approaching resolution. Recall in our April 2023 fuel recovery application, we filed two options for consideration. One option amortizes the fuel balance over 3 years. In the second option, we have respectively set forth for the West Virginia Commission consideration, the use of the 2023 securitization legislation to manage our $553 million deferred fuel balance along with securitizing store cost balances and net plant balances of generation assets. The generation assets are currently embedded in rate and assume to operate through 2040 and securitizing those assets nearly fully offset the fuel cost recovery impacts to customers.  We appreciate the engagement with all the stakeholder parties as we work toward a conclusion in this case by year-end and a constructive path for West Virginia. More detail on regulated activities can be found in the appendix on Slides 35 through 38.  I'm pleased with the progress we've made this quarter and by the great work underway to actively manage the business, deliver on our commitments and create value for our investors, all while keeping affordability and reliability for our customers at the center of everything we do. We have a strong team in place, and I'm confident that we'll continue to execute on our strategic priorities and advance our capital investment plan to deliver reliable, affordable power to our customers. I look forward to seeing many of you in person at the EEI Conference in a couple of weeks. At the conference in Phoenix will provide some additional color on our business strategy, share our 2024 guidance and other financial details, including our 2024 through 2028 capital plan and related 5-year cash flows. Now with that, I'll hand it off to Chuck, we'll walk through performance drivers and details supporting our financial targets. Chuck? Charles Zebula : Thank you, Julie. It's good to be with you and everyone on the call this morning. As many of you know, I've been in many different roles at AP, but this is my first earnings call as the CFO. I'm truly honored to return to the exceptional finance team at AEP and lead this area as we embrace the opportunity to invest in our regulated utilities and serve our customers with affordable and reliable electric service.  Today, I will discuss our third quarter and year-to-date results. share some updates on our service territory load and economy and finish with commentary on credit metrics and liquidity as well as confirming our guidance financial targets and a recap of our commitments to stakeholders. Let's go to Slide 9, which shows the comparison of GAAP to operating earnings GAAP earnings for the third quarter were $1.83 per share compared to $1.33 per share in 2022. Year-to-date GAAP earnings through September were $3.62 per share compared to $3.76 per share in 2022. As was mentioned on the second quarter earnings call, our year-to-date comparison of GAAP to operating earnings reflects the loss on the sale of the contracted renewables business as a nonoperating cost as well as an adjustment to true-up costs related to the terminated Kentucky transaction. In addition, we have reflected our typical mark-to-market adjustment and the impact of capitalized incentive compensation in Texas as nonoperating earnings as well. There's a detailed reconciliation of GAAP to operating earnings on Pages 17 and 18 of the presentation today. Moving to Slide 10. Operating earnings for the third quarter totaled $1.77 per share or $924 million compared to $1.62 per share or $831 million last year. The higher performance compared to last year was primarily driven by favorable rate changes and transmission project execution, increased retail load and favorable O&M across our segments. Operating earnings for vertically integrated utilities were $1 per share, up $0.03 from last year. Favorable drivers included rate changes across multiple jurisdictions, increases in retail load, depreciation, transmission revenue and O&M. These items were somewhat offset by higher interest expense and unfavorable weather year-over-year. the vertically integrated segment did see positive weather versus normal in the third quarter of about $0.04 per share, but this was compared to positive weather in the third quarter last year of about $0.06 per share.  Consistent with our first and second quarter results, depreciation was favorable at the vertically integrated segment by $0.01 in quarter 3, primarily due to the expiration of the Rockport Unit 2 lease in December 2022. However, if we exclude the impact of the lease depreciation would have been about $0.02 unfavorable, which is consistent with incremental investment activity in our vertically integrated segment. INM should see an additional $0.02 favorable net depreciation in the fourth quarter as well. The Transmission & Distribution Utility segment earned $0.39 per share, up $0.07 compared to last year. Favorable drivers in this segment included increased retail load, transmission revenue, positive rate changes in Texas and Ohio and favorable O&M Partially offsetting these favorable items were higher depreciation and higher interest expense. The AEP Transmission Holdco segment contributed $0.39 per share, up $0.06 compared to last year. Favorable investment growth of $0.02, coupled with favorable income taxes of $0.02 are largely driving the change here.  Generation and Marketing produced $0.18 per share, up $0.04 from last year. The positive variance is primarily due to favorable impacts associated with the contracted renewable sale in August, along with higher generation margins and land sales. These favorable items were partially offset by lower retail and wholesale power margins.  Finally, Corporate and Other was down $0.05 per share, driven by unfavorable interest and partially offset by favorable O&M. Please note that our year-to-date operating earnings performance by segment is shown on Slide 16 in the appendix of our presentation today.  Many of the positive drivers are the same for the year as for the quarter, and the negative year-to-date variance is driven largely by unfavorable weather and higher interest expenses. Before we move on, I want to add a few more comments on O&M, including our outlook for the remainder of the year. We saw favorable O&M in the third quarter compared to the prior year, which was consistent with our expectations. For the fourth quarter, we are expecting more than $100 million of favorable O&M versus the prior year, which would bring us to a net favorable position for the full year from a consolidated perspective. The favorable change anticipated in the fourth quarter is largely a result of the timing of O&M spending in the prior year, including employee-related expenses and a contribution to the AEP Foundation in the fourth quarter of last year, along with continued actions we have taken, such as holding employment positions open, reducing travel and adjusting the timing of discretionary spending.  Turning to Slide 11. I will provide an update on whether normalized low performance for the quarter and our expectations through the end of the year. Overall, load has come in ahead of plan all year, and the third quarter was no exception. Looking to the bottom right-hand quadrant. Normalized retail load grew 2.1% in Q3 from a year earlier. You also noticed that we have updated our full year 2023 estimates based on the strong loan growth we've experienced year-to-date. Weather normalized retail load is now expected to finish this year 2.3% higher than 2022, an increase that is nearly 3x higher than our original expectations. This strength comes from exceptional growth in commercial load driven by data centers in Ohio, Texas and Indiana, but the third quarter also saw positive trends in our residential class, which is shown in the upper left-hand quadrant of the slide.  Residential load increased for the first time in more than a year in Q3 with growth of 0.6% from a year earlier. The relationship between customer incomes and inflation is a key driver of residential usage and has begun to stabilize as expected in the second half of this year. This month's CPI data point was yet another encouraging sign that inflationary pressures on our residential customers are continuing to lessen. We note that residential usage per customer have seen slight declines this year as energy efficiencies increase, more workers return to offices and customers change behavior due to inflation.  Fortunately, we are seeing strong enough growth in our customer base, especially in Texas and Ohio to help partially offset these trends. Year-to-date, we have added nearly 30,000 residential customers across our footprint.  Moving to the lower left-hand quadrant of the slide, our investor load declined in the third quarter, driven by a pullback in usage by some of our key manufacturing customers. namely chemical, plastic and tire producers as well as downstream participants of the energy industry. This reflects some of the softness in manufacturing nationally as producers have slowed activity in response to uncertainty around the economic outlook. We expect this to reverse itself in the months ahead as recent inflation and jobs data have reduced the probability of a recession occurring in the next year. We are forecasting industrial load to remain positive through the end of next year and beyond.  Moving to the upper right-hand quadrant of the slide, we see another impressive quarter for commercial load. In the third quarter, commercial load was 7.5% higher than a year ago, driven by the addition of new data center customers, mostly in Ohio, Texas and Indiana. We expect the pace of year-over-year growth in our commercial load to moderate some in 2024 as new projects work their way through the queue. Many of the large projects currently underway within our footprint won't come fully online until 2025. However, there is upside if a few of these projects move forward earlier than expected. Many of these gains are directly attributable to our ongoing efforts to facilitate more economic development across our operating footprint. We know that working with local stakeholders to attract more economic activity is a key strategy to providing value to the communities we serve. It allows us to prioritize investments that improve the customer experience while also mitigating rate impacts on our customer base.  Moving to Slide 12. In the lower left corner, you can see our FFO to debt metric stands at 11.4%, which is an increase of 30 basis points from last quarter but continues to be well below our targeted range of 14% to 15%. The primary reason for the increase is a $1.8 billion decrease in debt during the quarter due to long and short-term debt retirements, driven by proceeds received from our contracted renewable sale and the successful completion of our planned equity units conversion, both of which occurred in August. We expect this metric will continue to improve throughout the remainder of this year and anticipate reaching our targeted range in early next year as we see an improvement in FFO during that time. We have included a table on the slide that shows the path to the targeted FFO to debt range early next year. These items -- these are items that impact both the 12-month rolling average as well as an estimated increase in the quarterly FFO. We anticipate a 180 to 190 basis point positive impact on FFO that enables the metric to be in the 13% to 14% range by year-end based on the following items : a roll-off of roughly $600 million in cash collateral, deferred fuel and other outflows from the fourth quarter of 2022 and continued cash recovery of deferred fuel balances in the fourth quarter of this year that total between $150 million and $200 million in accordance with the regulatory orders we have already received.  Moving into 2024, the continued roll-off of prior year cash collateral outfall in the amount of $390 million in the first quarter of 2023 and a $90 million adjustment from unfavorable weather in the first quarter of this year to normal weather in our forecast for next year, will result in an incremental 100 basis point improvement put us within our target range of 14% to 15%. Also, please note that we have updated our 2023 cash flow, as shown on Page 29 in the appendix. An increase of $1.2 billion in required capital is shown versus the original forecast, mostly due to a decrease of $800 million in cash from ops largely due to fuel inventory and an increase of $300 million in capital expenditures. Please note that our equity needs for 2023 are unchanged. The remaining years 2024 to 2027, along with rebilling 2028, will be updated at the upcoming EEI conference. Expect that this update will be consistent with our prior equity meetings and disclosures.  Moving to Slide 13. You can see our liquidity summary in the middle of the slide. Our 5-year $4 billion bank revolver and our 2-year $1 billion revolving credit facility to support our liquidity position, which remains strong at $3.5 billion. On a GAAP basis, our debt to cap decreased from the prior quarter by 220 basis points to 62.4%. This large change can be attributed to the large reduction in debt, driven by our contracted renewable sale and the completion of our planned equity units that I mentioned earlier.  On the qualified pension front, our funding status decreased 1.9% during the quarter to 100.3%. This is largely due to equity and fixed income losses in the third quarter as interest rates increased and equity indices fell in both August and September. These losses are partially offset by a decreased liability due to rising interest rates.  Let's go to Slide 14 for a quick recap of today's message. The third quarter produced growth in earnings well above the prior year, driven primarily by favorable rate changes, increased load and favorable O&M offsetting milder weather and increased interest expense. As we continue to move through the fourth quarter, we are focused on cost management efforts with the goal of mitigating the headwinds we have faced this year, primarily unfavorable weather and higher interest costs. The strong third quarter results and low growth, coupled with our proactive plan for the balance of the year, allow us to confidently narrow our operating guidance range to $5.24 to $5.34 per share. We also continue to be committed to our long-term growth rate of 6% to 7%. And as Julie mentioned earlier, our sales efforts to simplify and derisk the AEP portfolio remain on track. We really appreciate your time and our management team and I look forward to seeing you at the upcoming EEI Financial Conference in Phoenix. With that, I'm going to ask the operator to open the call so we can hear your questions or comments. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Nick Campanella with Barclays. Nicholas Campanella : And congrats, Chuck on the new role. I wanted to actually start there, if I can. I know that there was just some language in the 8-K when you made the executive switch around the mandatory retirement age, in your interest in retiring before you reach that age. But I just wanted to ask, are your intentions here to stay on to the foreseeable future? Is this more temporary? Just how should we kind of think about your new role in company. Charles Zebula : Yes. No, thank you for the question. And look, I am absolutely embracing this opportunity that we have before us. It's very energizing to enter into a role like this. And although -- the AK did indicate that I'm committed to Julie and AEP to write this out as long as needed. And as long as I'm adding value right to the opportunity. So thank you for the question. Nicholas Campanella : I appreciate the answer. And then I appreciate the walk on the FFO. That's helpful. I just wanted to confirm because S&P did move you to negative outlook. And I think in your prepared remarks, you said as you get to EEI, you anticipate equity needs being somewhat unchanged. So is it the right understanding that if you are in a CapEx rate scenario that your equity needs to still be modest and unchanged versus your prior view? And then secondly, understanding that the 11.4% has some reduction in debt from the renewable proceeds. The cash flow from those renewal proceeds, I guess, would be rolling off into next year. And I just want to triple check, that even with the asset sales, cash flow dilution, you still see yourselves above 14%. Charles Zebula : Yes. Yes, thanks for both questions. So yes, our equity needs will be consistent, right, with what we have disclosed prior. I mean, clearly, we'll be updating, right, the years in the cash flow forecast, but expect no surprises there. . On to your second question, yes, we tried to highlight right, on the slide, the FFO slide, the major drivers that you can point to and see what is rolling out as outflow. But absolutely, right, in our financial models, right? It takes into account, right, the absence of that cash flow. So we do expect to be in those ranges. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Jeremy Tonet : We've seen a bit of a regime change as it relates to interest rates out there, given the sharp moves recently. Just wondering if you could talk a bit more about that and how AP is able to affirm the 6% to 7% long-term CAGR there in what could be higher for longer interest rate environment? What impact do you see on EPS 2023? And kind of how do you think about offsetting those headwinds? Charles Zebula : Yes. Joe, thank you for the question. I mean, look, we'll be giving you a walk right on 2024 at EEI. But there's no question that we are planning for an interest rate higher for longer environment. We've clearly been able to overcome those headwinds this year, but they will persist. So our plan is to, a, sensibly finance this company, right, continue to remain committed to mid-grade investment-grade credit. And our recovery mechanisms on interest rates, some of them are somewhat immediate or very near term, right? Some of them are kind of medium term and then some of them do have some lag associated with them. So the reality is some of this will begin to flow through. We remain committed to keeping parent debt in that range, well below 25%, 19% to 21% is ideal and offsetting those headwinds like with continued investment, we're seeing strong loan growth and the positive regulatory outcomes and closing the ROE gap that Julie just mentioned. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. That's very helpful there. Maybe kind of picking up on that last point there. I think on the last call, we discussed a bit -- or there's some questions regarding outreach to commissions and just building regulatory relationships across the jurisdictions. I'm just wondering if you can provide a bit more detail, I guess, on specific initiatives done so far, where do you see that going? How you see that kind of transpiring so far? Julia Sloat : Yes. Nick, thanks for the question. This is Julie. We continue on with that effort. In terms of engagement with our various state commissions as well as talking with folks at the FERC level. it's important to note that we do this in conjunction with our operating company presidents and leadership there. And my objective and your senior leadership team's objective is to clear the path operating company presidents and those teams so that they can have a very good traction with their respective commissions and their respective economies in the state.  So those continue to occur. And honestly, just keeps me educated so that I can make sure that when we build the strategic plan at the aggregate level that it makes sense, and we're taking into consideration our customers' needs and also the economies that are driving all this magic that's happening across our entire footprint. So it continues as she goes in terms of those conversations, and we'll continue to stay out in front of folks and do our best to support our operating companies. So nothing super exciting to report other than the action is absolutely happening, and we'll see that embedded in the cases that we're filing. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. And just to confirm, the plan is still for you to meet each of the commissions when you're able to do so? Julia Sloat : Yes. Honestly, I enjoyed getting out anyway and talking with everybody. Like I said, I think it makes me better at my job. I'm making the round. And I got to be sensitive to what we've got going on in our respective jurisdictions. In some cases, I've got export issues I got to be sensitive to. But I'm absolutely making the rounds, and we'll continue to do that because the business is incredibly dynamic more so than ever. And we need to make sure that we're staying in touch with everything that's going on across the entire organization. So that will continue on. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. That's very helpful. And just the last one, if I could. The waterfall chart through 9 months in the presentation today, it was a bit different than, I guess, what we saw on EEI. Just wondering if you could walk us through some of the puts and takes, the drivers to this, and across the different segments and what do you see, I guess, in the fourth quarter that maybe narrows the gap or just kind of the different trends happening such as in vertically integrated with renewables as well? Julia Sloat : Yes. So I'll start and I'll hand it off the Chuck. So what gives us comfort in terms of narrowing the guidance range when you -- I look at Page 16, I sum that's where everybody is right now in terms of that waterfall chart. So what gives us a comfort is Chuck mentioned that we are able to effectively, I guess, take our low forecast predominantly driven by the commercial load that we're seeing. So that's going to be incorporated into our thoughts for the remainder of the year. We're trying to manage the interest expense that's also incredibly important. Another data point to throw out there. No question we keep getting is -- what percentage of your debt outstanding is floating rate is about 12.5%, if I remember correctly, as of the end of the third quarter. So that's something that we're being remindful of. We're also thinking about what regulatory cases that we have already in hand. As a matter of fact, you may recall that when we began the year, we had something like $290 million of new rate release embedded in our forecast. Actually well north of that. We're at about $303 million of secured rate relief in hand. So that gives us a little more confidence and comfort to as we proceed through the end of the year. So again, it's really just steady as she goes and plug in Chuck. I don't know, Chuck, had anything else you want to add to that? Charles Zebula : Yes. Sure, Julie. Look, the other thing is the O&M Management. As I mentioned during my comments, if you look at Slide 16, right, you'll see that O&M is a drag two through three quarters, right? We expect that to completely reverse itself for year-end and actually have a net positive on O&M year-over-year, meaning that the fourth quarter will have a substantial difference in O&M versus last year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Shahriar Purreza with Guggenheim Partners. Jamieson Ward : It's Jamieson Ward on for Shar. Looking at your new FFO to debt pass side, could you give us a sense on what if anything could cause any potential slippage like the deferred fuel recovery? And what might dictate you being at the bottom or the top end of that 14% to 15% in 2024? I know you talked previously about being at the midpoint by the end of the year. But since we've got an updated disclosure here, I just wanted to ask that again here. Charles Zebula : Yes. No, sure. When you look at the chart, several of these are just simply facts, right, that are going to come out. All the outflows, right, are no numbers, right, that are rolling out of the 12-month average. So then we're just subject to the normal variances. In FFO that would occur. It's a preworking capital number. And the reality is, right, softer weather, better weather, all those things will influence it. But I think we'll be solidly in both ranges, right, by the time frames that we talked about. . Jamieson Ward : Got it. And one more from us. On load growth, what's driving the large -- I know you mentioned data centers, but -- if you could just talk a bit more about what's driving the large increase for the guidance this year? And then more specifically, as we think about the updated capital plan, which you'll be providing, just directionally, should we expect this higher load growth to be a driver of capital growth opportunities? Julia Sloat : Yes. This is Julie. I'll pass off the Chuck here to we'll take him a little bit. But as Chuck mentioned, the primary driver for our loan growth as we go into the end of 2023 is all around that commercial segment. So if you look at Page #11, look in that upper right-hand quadrant, you're going to see a serious or material shift in what our updated guidance looks like versus what we originally had for 2023. The vast majority of that loan growth is coming from data centers located in Ohio, Texas and also in the [indiscernible]. And if you look across the rest of the segments there. So residential, a little soft. We talked a little bit about at the beginning of the call here on our monologue our prepared remarks about the fact that customers are feeling this in the wallet as it relates to inflation, et cetera. We expect that that's going to improve over time. But nevertheless, what's allowing us to get a little more comfort the residential side is we've added 30,000 customers year-to-date. So that offset a lot of the otherwise pressure we would have seen in that segment as usage for customers come off a little bit. And on the industrial side, it's really driven by interest rates. And the expectation, I guess, concerns that there could be some softening in the economy. So we've seen certain customer segments within that industrial aspect kind of come off a little bit. But we expect over time that will improve I don't know Chuck, is there anything else to come on hand? Charles Zebula : You mentioned that the drive your capital forecast. And of course, the new data centers, of course, require capital to hook those customers up. We do have what is known and customers that are coming into our capital forecast going forward. And there are lots of discussions otherwise, right, in our economic development activities. But everything that we know of and its firm is in our capital forecast. Jamieson Ward : Got you. Just one clarifying -- one last clariffying question. So question is really focused around that 7.3% guidance for '23 for commercial versus the 80 basis points originally, Presumably, the infrastructure necessary for those data centers to be receiving a load that they are in place, especially extremely about a couple months left in the year. And we obviously saw that you'll be providing '24 and '25 guidance on the EEI. So we're just directionally trying to think, is this a trend likely? Is this isolated to '23? Or is this something that could continue and could drive, therefore, capital opportunities as you look to sort of about increasing commercial data center load and then that's it for me. Julia Sloat : No, I appreciate the question so much. Yes. That trend, we expect that to continue. I mean you see the fluctuation a little bit in the commercial segment up in the upper right quadrant that slide I mentioned earlier. We have projects in the Q so you kind of see those ebb and flow, but you're right the infrastructure is in place today the pending or incoming request for additional capacity from our customers. So that customer touch point or our economic development team is incredibly important because that allows us to not only have confidence around what our forecast is, but it also drives what the CapEx program needs to be. yes, we think that, that's going to continue, and we will keep a keen eye on that in particular because the infrastructure gotten be there. We got to make sure that we're communicating with our customers that they know exactly what the appropriate and realistic time line is for them to enter into our service territory so that the infrastructure is there because it's not something that's done overnight. So I appreciate that question so much because it is a fine orchestration that absolutely has to happen. . Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Carly Davenport with Goldman Sachs. Carly Davenport : Maybe to start, as we just think about the moving pieces on cash sources going forward, could you talk a little bit about how the asset sales processes are progressing in terms of interest that you're seeing but ask. And then on the timing side, it seems like a little bit of a narrowing of the time frame for NMRD. But anything else on the timing side that you highlight? Julia Sloat : Yes, I can start in Chuck and jump here too because tucking really close to the optimization that we've been doing. Anyway, yes, so from an MRB perspective, we're getting close here. So I would anticipate a contract being signed in a not-too-distant future and isn't really going to be a story around when can you close? So that can be driven also by our regulatory and won't probably get FERC approval depending on who the purchaser is that can drive other issues that we'll need to address. So we can give you a more precise time on when we can land that jet. So stay tuned, that ones in the hopper and coming along here relatively quickly. And then Chuck, do you want to talk little bit about retail and distributed? Charles Zebula : Yes, you did ask a question, I do want to address, right, what's the data asking, of course, we're not going to reveal anything like that in a public forum, but we are pleased with the response we received in some of the early results. that are indicative of course, but the process kind of goes on. Greg Hall and his team are leading that effort. There are in the queue remaining this year the typical process of management meetings and moving on to final bids either late this year or early next year. So the reality is, right, that's going to take some time to progress. I expect to complete that in the first half of next year. and the other sales processes are just shortly behind that. Carly Davenport : Great. That's helpful. And then I appreciate the color on the drivers on O&M heading into 4Q and for the full year. I guess how are you thinking about managing O&M into 2024? Should we expect to see an uptick that kind of offset some of the efficiencies that you've driven this year that have addressed the mode weather and allow you to continue to execute on the earnings guidance for 2023? Charles Zebula : Yes. So that's a good question. I can tell you what the discussion amongst the executive leadership team here are really focused on prioritizing O&M spend and spending both capital and O&M dollars that benefit and provide value to our customers. So we're really targeting the prioritization. We'll be giving guidance on O&M for next year in our waterfall at EEI, but expect us to be conservative, right? We're going to manage O&M to the levels, right, that are needed to run our business, right, but begin to eliminate things that are what we may consider to be discretionary going forward. . Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley. David Arcaro : I think thanks again for the disclosure around the [indiscernible] into the first quarter of 2021, and you've touched on this a little bit, but I was just wondering how you see that metric track after that point from getting to the range as a stable to rising from there and kind of staying within the target range going forward when you look at the core business outlook? Charles Zebula : Yes. We absolutely plan to target and be in that 14% to 15% range. I will tell you that the introduction of large projects on a year-to-year basis, right, may swing that around some. So as you add renewable projects, in particular, if they come at the end of the calendar year, right? You have the financing costs related to that, but you don't have the FFO. The rating agencies are very well of that pattern. But absolutely, when you pro forma that, right, 14% to 15% is where we intend to be. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Crowdell with Mizuho. Anthony Crowdell : Welcome back, Chuck. Great to hear from you again. Just only two quick ones. I think Nick touched on it earlier on recent S&P had revised their outlook on the holding company. I'm just curious I guess your discussions with the rating agencies. We appreciate the detail you provided in the slide deck specially on your credit improvement. But have you been in discussion how you unveil that previously to S&P prior to their rating to or their outlook change? Charles Zebula : Yes. So Anthony, I talked to all three rating agencies since it's coming in and as well as our treasury team obviously talks to them all the time. I don't think the S&P move to negative outlook was a particular surprise, given the downgrade threshold and are rating a split, right? They're at a higher rating, right, than Moody's and Fitch currently. So it wasn't a surprise. We continue to work with the agencies to explain our business risk because we think as we continue to execute on exiting the unregulated businesses, our business makes sure to improve. And they should begin to reflect that in their evaluations. So not a surprise. If and when it is downgraded, their ratings would be on par with Moody's and Fitch. . Anthony Crowdell : Great. And then just lastly, you laid out the two scenarios regarding West Virginia fuel cost recovery. One is an amortization over 2 years. The other one is the securitization, which also includes accelerating coal plant closures, Given, I guess, the impact of the balance sheet and all the other moving pieces, does the company have a preferred path in West Virginia? And then also, when do we get resolution on that from the regulator? Julia Sloat : Yes, I appreciate that question. And let me just clarify the question as well right out of the gate here. To the extent that we've included securitization as an option, that does not assume an acceleration of coal plant closures, just to be very clear on that. We have those embedded in rates today going through 2040. So that is the current plan of thinking. So the idea of using securitization was entirely driven by how do we minimize the impact on customer rates. Period.  And so that was the spirit of why we even contemplated the utilization of the securitization. And that second scenario option that I mentioned where we not only securitize the fuel, but we have, I think, a little bit of storm cost in there as well as those plant balances would effectively render customer rates neutral. So no impact, okay, de minimis. And then the other alternative was just a 3-year smoothing of those deferrals -- or those deferred costs. And that was to the two, I want to say it was maybe 12% increase in customer rates associated with that subject to check. So as far as our preference would be, our preference is to get it recover. Our preference is to be able to work with all the different stakeholders, which is precisely why we put out the different options and listen to the different stakeholders in the case just with complete appreciation sensitivity to the customers in West Virginia that the general median household income tends to be a bit lower than most definitely the national average, but even across AEP's footprint, it's lower. So we need to be incredibly sensitive to those wallets. As far as preference. Our preference simply is to work with it in the stakeholders and get it done. And as far as when we might be able to get that done, our expectation is that we get that done here in the fourth quarter. So tic tok, any time here, okay? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Weisel with Scotiabank. Andrew Weisel : Good morning, everybody. Good morning. A lot of information already. So I've only got one less if you can clarify here. I want to ask about the three moving pieces between equity asset sales and CapEx. And I know you're going to talk about this at a couple of weeks, but my question is that if equity needs are generally going to be consistent, how do we think about how you'll finance incremental CapEx? You typically roll forward the CapEx plan, it tends to go up most years. It's currently $40 billion. Does that mean that cash proceeds from these asset sales should help to finance whatever upside there is on the CapEx plan? Or will you have additional equity until the asset sales are announced? How do you think about that bouncing act? Julia Sloat : Yes. So I'll let my CFO jump in here. But first things first, we want to have a healthy balance sheet, okay? So dollars come in the door. We're going to make sure that our metrics work. We talked a little bit or a lot about 14% to 15% FFO to debt. We also pay attention to our debt-to-cap ratios, but 14% to 15% is our gating item for us in metric. So we will look to that metric to see where we're shaking out. Dollars will be placed accordingly as we bring those in the dollar associated with sales.  As far as equity needs go, as Chuck mentioned, I guess, again, the free study issue goes on average, we're around $700 million, plus or minus any given year to see that in cash flow that we have out here on Page #29. We are going to continue on with a healthy CapEx program. You'll see that extended into 2028 when we talk to you at EEI. But there may be fluctuations like sequentially year-to-year. But I wouldn't anticipate any material shift or change, again, getting item dollars in the door, take care of the balance sheet, and then we'll fund the rest of the regulated business that way. And, Chuck, there anything as you add to that? Charles Zebula : No. Julie, I think your answer is -- I really can't add anything. I would just say, embrace the capital opportunity and sensibly and smartly finance. Andrew Weisel : Okay. Great. That's helpful. And if you can just remind us what are the downgrade thresholds for Moody's and Fitch? Julia Sloat : 13% FFO to debt. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Durgesh Chopra : Chuck will come the forward work with you. Just real quick on the FFO to debt metric. I just want to clarify the 13% to 14% target for end of this year. Are you assuming that Virginia fuel recovery that's resolved? Julia Sloat : No. As a matter of fact, what is assumed in that forecast that walk as today is everything that we already have in hand. So West Virginia fuel outcome does not disrupt that path at all. That's prospective for us. Durgesh Chopra : Got it. So okay. So any sort of -- any incremental sort of cash flow bump from that would be accretive to what you show on this slide, right, even for 2014? Julia Sloat : That would be helpful, yes. Durgesh Chopra : Okay. Perfect. And then maybe just one quick -- one real quick -- what's the balance the total deferred fuel cost balance that hasn't been covered as of the Q3, I know the $1.4 billion as of Q2? . Julia Sloat : Yes. $1.2 billion as of the end of the third quarter, and that's in aggregate across the AEP footprint of fleet of utility companies. . Durgesh Chopra : West Virginia roughly like $500 million, correct? . Julia Sloat : West Virginia. Yes, West Virginia is what can be specific, $574.8 million. So call it $575 million. We're paying attention to this. So that's why a little bit of detail here. That's important. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: So just coming back to that O&M piece, obviously, you put some comments in the script here. 100 million. Look, I think that's a solid number. I'm just curious, how do you think about that annualizing here and the ability to annualize in those sectors? I get that some of them are kind of discrete in nature here, certain elections. But in an effort to kind of preview a little bit more on that '24 trajectory. I know you made a couple of allusions to it here. Can you perhaps lean in a bit further and describing how you think about what that could do for next year on the cost side? Charles Zebula : So we're going to lead into that PEI in about 7 or 8 days or 9 days, whatever it is. But the folks right at the management team, as I said earlier, is really on prioritizing the spend and spending dollars where it matters most to our customers. That's the most important thing we can do in our O&M budget will reflect that. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Yes. No, I respect that, hence the interest. Okay. One while I'll leave it there. And you mind just on the low side just to clarify it a little bit further here. I mean, obviously, you have an updated load in the near year that is sensitively more robust and you have a backward dated load growth profile here for '24,'25. How do you think about the time line for revisions and the extent of those revisions as you see it today, again, I know this is probably more in the EEI 4Q conversation. But I mean, clearly, we see this kind of revisions across the PJM footprint. How do you think about that? And also maybe how does that tee up with PJM itself here and potential further transmission-oriented opportunities? Charles Zebula : Yes. So as you can see, right, the low growth in particular in commercial is pretty robust. Those numbers will be updated when we on the EEI. And as I said earlier, it's embraced the opportunity. This is a good opportunity for us. I think you have to be smart about it and kind of vet out what is real and what is a real load is going to come on. and plan your capital investment profile around that. So lots of activity, lots of discussions. Our economic development team is very busy talking and dealing with the opportunity. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Sophie Karp with KeyBanc. Sophie Karp : Can you please clarify, you mentioned that you could implement or that it's possible to implement interim rates in Kentucky in January? Do you actually intend to do that? Or how does it take sort of politically it would work out for you there? Julia Sloat : Yes. Generally, we try to take advantage of that. So that would be the plan. And of course, we'll stay in close contact with all the stakeholders store case and the commission. And so other than that, just as we have done in say, for example, the PSO that is typical for us if there's an opportunity to implement rates. We go ahead and do that and kind of risk-adjusted in terms of our forecast and understand when cash has been coming the door alters items that are so important as we put the forecast out to you guys and have confidence around that. But short answer is, yes, generally speaking, that, we would expect to put those in place or implement the rates. Sophie Karp : Got it. And then just a broad question, I guess. Is there any interest to approach state regulators in stake mechanisms to reduce weather volatility impact on your earnings. I know you're not decoupled in most of our jurisdictions. So kind of curious if you like that type of rate mechanisms or would you drive transition time to situation whether doesn't impact you earn that much. Julia Sloat : Yes. We engage in those conversations. And again, that's more of a stakeholder discussion and see what the temperature and tolerance would be as it relates to not only just out preferences the preferences and tones of other party to the cases. That being said, we did have the coupling hi for a while that is installed by the wayside, but that's something that we have a regular conversation about. So I wouldn't say that we have a push or a thrust towards getting a decoupling in place, but it's absolutely a tool in the toolbag.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Hello and thank you for standing by. My name is Regina and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the American Electric Power Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the conference over to Darcy Reese, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Darcy Reese : Thank you, Regina. Good morning, everyone. And welcome to the fourth quarter 2023 earnings call for American Electric Power. We appreciate you taking time today to join us. Our earnings release, presentation slides and related financial information are available on our website at aep.com.  Today we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors.  Joining me this morning for opening remarks are Ben Fowke, our Interim President and Chief Executive Officer; Chuck Zebula, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and Peggy Simmons, our Executive Vice President of Utilities. We will take your questions following their remarks.  I will now turn the call over to Ben. Ben Fowke : Well, thank you, Darcy. Good morning and welcome to American Electric Power\u2019s fourth quarter 2023 earnings call. It's great to have a chance to reconnect with you, although I never thought it would be under these circumstances.  As you know the AEP board of directors made a decision to remove Julie Sloat from her duties as Chair, President and CEO. Taking this action was not easy, but the board believes it was in the best interest of AEP and its stakeholders to do so. On behalf of the board and the entire AEP family. I would like to wish Julie well and thank her for all her contributions. I would also like to assure everyone that Julie's departure was not due to any unethical behavior, disagreements of financial policy or because of any violation of AEP\u2019s code of conduct.  Now, as many of you are aware after my retirement from Xcel Energy, I joined the AEP board in February of 2022. I was attracted to this board because I was impressed with AEP\u2019s business model, its strong asset base and the quality of its leadership team and board. I'm even more impressed two years later. In my tenure here,  I've seen the AEP team rise to meet multiple challenges. Let me give you some examples starting with earnings. For 14 years in a row, AEP has met or exceeded earnings guidance, and 2023 is no exception. Our operating earnings came in at $5.25, that's within our guidance range despite $0.37 of unfavorable weather and $.45 of increased interest cost over the prior year. As you know, controlling O&M expense has been a challenge for the industry. And AEP has met that challenge, essentially keeping O&M flat for the last 10 years, while at the same time doubling its asset base. This team's continuous focus on O&M efficiency is nothing short of excellent.  You may also recall that in early 2023, the Texas Commission denying a petition to be part of SWEPCO is 999-megawatt renewables project for $2.2 billion. But the team didn't miss a beat and put the project back on track with Arkansas and Louisiana ultimately stepping up to move forward with the full project. As a result, and including SWEPCO. Today, we have commission approval of $6.6 billion of new renewable projects throughout AEP\u2019s service territory, representing a 70% achievement of our current 5-year $9.4 billion new generation capital plan. I hope you would agree with me that that is really solid execution.  Initiatives to simplify and de-risk our portfolio are squarely in the focus of the board and the management team. And we are pleased with the great progress made. Last year, we completed the sale of our unregulated renewables portfolio, bringing in $1.2 billion of cash proceeds. We should be closing on our New Mexico renewable development solar portfolio within the next day or two. This in combination with the expected conclusion of our retail and distributed resources sales process in the second quarter, keeps us on schedule to achieve our 2024 asset sales targets.  Now as we move forward, AEP will continue to be a disciplined portfolio manager and we will be willing to take action when price and the ability to execute intersect. To that end, we've made the decision to retain our ownership interest in both our Prairie Wind and Pioneer Transmission joint ventures. We also completed the review of Transource and ultimately determined that owning this joint venture fits strategically within our portfolio. We'd like our remaining assets. And we'll focus going forward on doubling down on our efforts to achieve constructive regulatory outcomes that will allow us to provide the quality of service our customers need and expect.  Regarding Icahn Capital, our recent agreement came about from a combination of a constructive dialogue between AEP and the Icahn teams. Like us, the Icahn team believes AEP shares are undervalued and there's meaningful upside potential for our investors. The addition to AEP\u2019s board will bring fresh perspective as we continue to execute on strategic priorities and enhance value for our stakeholders. Looking ahead, today, we are reaffirming our 2024 full year operating earnings guidance range of $5.53 to $5.73, as well as our long-term earnings growth rate of 6% to 7%, which is underpinned by a $43 billion 5-year capital plan, in addition to 14% to 15% FFO to debt target, which Chuck will expand upon shortly.  You should know that I am committed to my role as Interim President and CEO. And I believe I can add value while the board works to identify a permanent successor. So before I turn it over to Peggy for regulatory updates and Chuck for financial review, let me also acknowledge that 2023 has been at times a challenging year at AEP. There's certainly been some twists and turns and a few bumps in the road. But I would encourage all of you to focus on the key opportunities that lie ahead. I have tremendous confidence in our team's ability to achieve our objectives as we work every day to deliver safe, reliable and affordable energies to our customer.  With that, I'll turn it over to Peggy. Peggy Simmons : Thanks, Ben. And good morning, everyone. Now I'd like to turn to update on our ongoing regulatory and legislative efforts. While we made important regulatory progress in 2023, it is clear that we can do even more to facilitate successful and constructive outcomes. Details of related activities can be found in the appendix on Slides 29 through 31.  Closing the authorized versus earned ROE gap is a key area of focus for us. Our fourth quarter ROE came in at 8.8% a slight improvement over third quarter. This also reflects impacts of approximately 40 basis points from mild weather conditions in 2023. Our efforts to improve and bridge the ROE gap is supported by work we've done related to the recent passage of legislation that will help position us to provide safe and reliable service while managing costs and reducing regulatory lag.  Most importantly, we obtained securitization in Kentucky, a biannual Distribution Cost Recovery Factor or DCRF in Texas, and rate reviews every two years in Virginia.  On the regulatory front, we secured several important wins over the course of 2023, including achieving constructive base rate case outcomes in Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Virginia, reestablishing formula rate plans in Arkansas and Louisiana and reaching a settlement and our Ohio ESP V filings, which were waiting to commission order. Overall, in 2023, we secured $312 million and rate relief. We also filed new base cases in Indiana, Michigan and Kentucky in 2023. In Indiana, we have already reached a settlement, which we filed in December, and we expect the commission decision by June of this year. In Michigan, we continue to advance through the process and currently expect a ruling in the case in July. In Kentucky, the base case and securitization application was approved by the commission earlier this year.  Other upcoming cases include a new Oklahoma base rate case for PSO, which we filed last month. Additional filings in the first quarter will include an AEP Texas base rate case and the APCo Virginia biennial rate review that should have the benefits of legislative changes attained in 2023. While we reached many constructive outcomes in 2023, we are disappointed in a couple disallowances recently received. First, in Texas, the commission issued a decision disallowing capitalization of AFUDC related to our Turk plant in mid-December 2023. And we filed a motion for reconsideration a week later. In West Virginia, last month, the commission disallowed a portion of our March 2021 to February 2023 under recovered fuel, and we recently filed an appeal with the West Virginia Supreme Court on February 8. We are also disappointed with the FERC order we received in January 2024 related to treatment of accumulated deferred income taxes associated with net operating loss carryforwards, or NOLC, mostly affecting our Transmission Holdco segment. We just filed for rehearing on February 20. Shortly, Chuck will discuss the related unfavorable net financial impact to 2023 operating earnings. Looking ahead, we know there is more work to be done as we advance our regulatory strategies in 2024 to achieve a forecasted regulated ROE of 9.1%. We are well on our way this year with almost 70% of rate relief either secured or related to mechanisms that are more administrative in nature. We look forward to continuing to engage constructively with our regulators and strengthening relationships at all levels. As Ben mentioned, this year, AEP continued to advance our 5-year $9.4 billion regulated renewables capital plan and now have a total of $6.6 billion approved by various state commissions. More detail of resource additions can be viewed in the appendix on Slides 32 through 34.  As previously disclosed, we received approval for APCo's 143 megawatts of wind generation, totaling more than $400 million of investment. This is in addition to the previously approved 209 megawatts of solar and wind projects for approximately $500 million. In 2023, we also received commission approval in both Indiana and Michigan for I&M 469 megawatts of solar projects, representing $1 billion of investment, PSO's 995.5-megawatt renewables portfolio for $2.5 billion and SWEPCO's 999-megawatt renewables for $2.2 billion.  Our fleet transformation goals are aligned with and supported by our integrated resource plan. We have pending requests for proposals for a diverse set of additional generation resources at I&M in Kentucky, PSO and SWEPCO, with more to come from other operating companies, including APCo. These generation investments are an integral part of our broader capital program, which is 100% focused on regulated assets and the production tax credits that are generated from our renewable energy projects, our path along to and provide great value to our customers. In addition to these projects, AEP is advancing an additional $27 billion in investments in our transmission and distribution systems to support reliability and resiliency. These combined investments underpin our 6% to 7% EPS growth commitment while mitigating customer bill impacts.  With that, I'll pass it over to Chuck to walk through the performance drivers in details supporting our financial commitments. Chuck Zebula : Thanks, Peggy. And good morning to everyone on the call. I'll walk us through the fourth quarter and full year results for 2023, share some updates on our service territory load, our outlook for this year and finish with commentary on credit metrics and liquidity. Let's go to Slide 9, which shows the comparison of GAAP to operating earnings for the quarter and year-to-date periods. GAAP earnings for the fourth quarter were $0.64 per share compared to $0.75 per share in 2022. For the year, GAAP earnings were $4.26 compared to $4.51 in 2022. As we have highlighted throughout 2023, our year-to-date comparison of GAAP to operating earnings reflects the gain or loss related to the sale of certain businesses, regulatory outcomes as well as our typical mark-to-market adjustments as non-operating.  Our team is committed to minimizing the variances between GAAP and operating earnings as we go forward. Detailed reconciliations of GAAP to operating earnings are shown on Slide 16 and 17 of the presentation today. Let's quickly cover the fourth quarter. Our fourth quarter earnings came in at $1.23 per share, which was a $0.18 improvement over the same period in 2022. Note that we had $0.25 of favorable O&M and strong performance in our Generation and Marketing segment, partially offset by $0.06 of unfavorable weather, $0.09 of higher interest costs and lower performance in Transmission Holdco. December weather, in particular, was the 28th warmest out of the last 30 years. For reference, the full details of our fourth quarter results are shown on Slide 15 of the presentation. Let's have a look at our full year results for 2023 on Slide 10. Operating earnings were $5.25 per share compared to $5.09 per share in 2022. Looking at the drivers by segment. Operating earnings for Vertically Integrated Utilities were $2.47 per share, down $0.09, mostly due to unfavorable weather, higher interest expense and higher income taxes. These items were partially offset by rate changes across various operating companies, increased transmission revenue, higher normalized retail load, favorable depreciation and lower O&M. Once again, depreciation is favorable at the Vertically Integrated segment, primarily due to the expiration of the Rockport Unit 2 lease in December 2022. The Transmission and Distribution Utility segment earned $1.30 per share, up $0.14 from last year. Positive drivers in this segment included increased transmission revenue, rate changes in Texas and Ohio and lower O&M. Partially offsetting these items were unfavorable weather, higher depreciation and higher interest expense. The AEP Transmission Holdco segment contributed $1.43 per share, up $0.11 from last year. Positive investment growth of $0.09 and favorable income taxes of $0.05 were the main drivers in this segment. As Peggy mentioned, we received the FERC NOLC order in January, resulting in an unfavorable net impact to consolidated earnings of $0.07 per share, with the majority of that impact occurring at the Transmission Holdco. The impact of this order to our 2024 plan is approximately $0.03 per share. Generation and Marketing produced $0.59 per share, up $0.09 from last year. The positive variance here is primarily due to improved retail and wholesale power margins, the sale of renewable development sites and favorable impacts associated with the contracted renewable sale in August. These items were partially offset by higher interest expense and unfavorable income taxes. Finally, Corporate and Other was down $0.09 per share, driven by higher interest expense, partially offset by a favorable year-over-year change in investment gains, largely due to investment losses that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2022. As we mentioned earlier, we are reaffirming our guidance range for 2024. For convenience, we've included an updated waterfall bridging our actual 2023 results to the midpoint of our guidance this year in Slide 24. While some variances changed due to last year's actual results, there is no change to our segments or overall guidance. Turning to Slide 11, I'll provide an update on weather normalized load performance. Overall retail load grew 2.5% in 2023. This was stronger than the 0.7% in our original guidance, thanks to an acceleration in data center growth and our commitment to economic development across our service territory. This is most apparent when looking at the incredible expansion in commercial load, shown in the upper right-hand quadrant of the slide. Commercial sales grew 7.8% for the year, and were again dominated by data centers. We are encouraged that the gains are becoming more geographically diverse. New projects have come online in Michigan, Kentucky and Oklahoma to supplement the development of what we see in Ohio and Texas. This is a trend we expect to continue over the next several years as the global demand for data storage and processing accelerates through the growth of AI and other technologies.  We expect commercial load to continue to grow from its new higher base this year as projects work their way through the queue and commitments for 2025 are exceptionally robust. I believe that some of the 2025 load is going to accelerate and bleed into this year. Industrial sales grew at 1.6%, which you can see in the lower left-hand quadrant of the slide. This is mostly attributable to a number of large industrial loads we've recently added across our service territories, which are more than offsetting any economic challenges seen by our existing customers. We expect industrial load growth to continue to reflect the softness in manufacturing nationally, with only a modest increase this year. However, growth in industrial sales beyond this year should accelerate as borrowing costs moderate and several large loads currently under construction come online. In the upper left-hand corner of the slide, you'll see that residential load declined slightly in 2023. Usage per residential customer has declined for the past two years, as homes have become more energy efficient and workers spend more time in an office instead of at home. The negative impact of inflation on household budgets may be influencing usage as well. On a positive note, we've seen our residential customer base grow consistently in certain regions. In 2023, we added almost 31,000 net new residential customers across our footprint, resulting in a positive offset to this segment. Overall, we're optimistic about the positive trends in load over the next several years, especially from a commercial and industrial perspective. Our conservative approach to estimating large loads gives us a lot of confidence in the growth we forecasted.  In our next update, however, I would expect to see some upside in this area. Let's move on to Slide 12 to discuss the company's capitalization and liquidity position. In the top left table, you can see the FFO to debt metric stands at 13.2% for 2023. Positive changes in FFO were as outlined on the third quarter call, and included favorable changes in cash collateral, fuel recovery and other various drivers. These positive changes were somewhat offset by an $830 million increase in debt during the quarter primarily due to the issuance of long-term debt to prefund our March 2024 AEP parent maturity.  We are pleased that the team has overcome strong financial headwinds due to unfavorable weather and an unprecedented increase in interest rates to end the year above Moody's downgrade threshold of 13%. We expect our FFO to debt metric to continue to improve throughout 2024 as we progress towards our targeted range of 14% to 15%. This continued positive trend assumes normal weather for 2024 and continued growth in our cash flows through various regulatory activities, including recovery of our deferred fuel balances of approximately $425 million. Our debt to cap increased from the prior quarter by 60 basis points to 63%, and our parent debt to total debt is approximately 21.7%. In the lower left quadrant of this slide, you can see our liquidity summary, which remains strong at $3.4 billion, and is supported by our bank revolver and credit facility. Lastly, on the qualified pension front, our funding status remains unchanged from the prior quarter to end the year at just over 100%. While falling interest rates increased the liability during the quarter, this increase was offset by positive asset returns. Turning to Slide 13. I'll give a quick recap of today's message. We delivered on our commitments for 2023 despite the significant challenges we faced. Weather was one of the most mild years on record for the AEP system in the past 30 years, resulting in a negative $0.37 impact year-over-year and $0.21 versus normal weather. To put a little more context to those numbers, our heating degree days were down 36% compared to normal across the system. Also, interest expense was a $0.45 hurdle to overcome versus 2022 results. We work diligently throughout the year to reprioritize and balance our plan by adjusting the timing of discretionary spend while staying focused on meeting our core business needs. While admittedly facing some challenges on the regulatory front, we secured many rate outcomes that were critical in supporting our objectives to provide reliable service to our customers. Looking into this year, we are optimistic about the opportunities and prepared to face any challenges ahead of us. We reaffirm our guidance for 2024 of $5.53 to $5.73 per share, our long-term growth rate of 6% to 7% and an improved balance sheet while continuing to implement our capital program, taking care of the customer, earning our authorized return and executing on our strategic priorities. I would like to take a moment and thank Julie Sloat for her 23 years with AEP. Julie has made a positive impact on AEP and will be missed by many. Ben, we welcome you to the AEP management team. Your leadership in the industry is well respected, and you will be embraced by the employees of AEP. The entire management team looks forward to working with you and the board as we look to enhance value for all AEP stakeholders.  Thank you for your time today. Operator, can you open up the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead. Shar Pourreza : Hey, guys. Good morning. Chuck Zebula : Good morning. So obviously, the slides are leaning on the successes of AEP. You've reiterated your earnings guidance, balance sheet targets, growth rate, CapEx numbers. I guess outside of some management shuffling, what do you see is broken? I guess, what's the goal of the review? What's on the table, what's off the table? Ben Fowke : Well, this is Ben. And I can tell you that I don't think I would use the word broken. I think there's areas where we can do better. I think -- and I think we showed you in the script, many of the accomplishments we made. We also recognize that we can do better on getting constructive regulatory outcomes. So strategically, our priorities remain the same. We have completed, as we mentioned, a review of Transource. We want to keep that asset. We think it's a great asset. And I think given the various changes that FERC is looking at, I think it gives us a lot of optionality. We'll continue to be very disciplined portfolio managers. I said it on my scripted remarks, but always willing to transact where price and the ability to execute intersect, and that's a key point. And finally, though, if you step back, I think one of the ways you add value in this industry long term is by placing CapEx at one times book, investing in CapEx at one times book and getting constructive recovery of that. And again, we've done pretty good on that, but we can do better. And we're going to look at the people, the process and the planning that goes into that. Those constructive outcomes, and we're going to do it through the lens of what's important to our local leaders and stakeholders.  Extremely important that we keenly listen to what they want and what they need at a local level. And I think you can translate that then to a much better chance for success, and then you get into that virtuous circle where invested capital not only is good for customers and the communities, but good for shareholders as well. So that's the plan going forward. Shar Pourreza : And do you believe, sort of, do you believe there's some jurisdictions that AEP currently operates where you may not be able to hit those sort of targets as you're thinking about people, process, et cetera? Ben Fowke : Well, I think there's areas where we have improvement, but I will turn it over to Peggy and/or Chuck to elaborate on that. Peggy Simmons : I think as it relates from a regulatory perspective, I do think what we're going to do is continue to build on the constructive legislative and regulatory outcomes that we have had. We're going to further strengthen our regulatory relationships, and we're really going to be keenly focused on execution. I think that some of the disappointments that we had in 2023, we're going to learn from them, and we're going to go back out and focus on execution from that standpoint. Shar Pourreza : Okay. Perfect. And then just lastly for me, just -- Ben, as you and the board are sort of thinking about where AEP stands today, I guess, what are you looking for in the next CEO? Are you kind of looking for a prior CEO or President of an OpCo, someone with a finance background, regulatory background, internal, external? I guess, can you just maybe specify exactly what you're looking for in the next successor? Ben Fowke : Well, it's definitely an external search. I'll start with that. And I don't want to narrow down to any specific background, but ideally -- and by the way, I think we're going to get a very robust list of candidates. So AEP is a great company with great assets. And I think it's going to be an attractive destination for many, many talented people. So I think it's going to be great to pick from that talent.  Ideally, you get a -- somebody that is a seasoned executive in the utility industry, is well known in the investor community. I think that's extremely important, has great leadership qualities. We've got a lot of talent at AEP, and we want to develop that talent. And ultimately, it would be ideal if they have multi-jurisdictional experience and the ability to achieve regulatory success.  Those are -- that's a big wish list. But again, I think we're going to get a lot of great candidates. Shar Pourreza : Got it. Terrific. Thank you, guys. I'll pass it to someone else, and good luck on Phase 2. I appreciate it. Ben Fowke : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Ben Fowke : Hey, Jeremy. Operator : Jeremy, your line is on mute. Jeremy Tonet : Hi, good morning. Ben Fowke : Good morning. Jeremy Tonet : I just want to kind of continue along these lines, if I could. And I was wondering if you're able to comment, I guess, on the recent agreement AEP announced with Icahn Capital and kind of how that ties into the change at the top here given the relatively short tenure? And just wondering if there's anything else we should be expecting, I guess, along these lines looking forward with Icahn's recent announcement? Ben Fowke : Yeah. I really just will probably just rehash what we've said in the press release and in our scripted remarks. I mean the Icahn -- additional board members came after discussions with the Icahn team and the AEP team. We actually welcome their perspective. They share the opinion as we do that AEP shares are undervalued, and we want to work together to unleash shareholder value. Regarding Julie's departure, I mean, I really can't go into any more details than what we've already said. It was a full board decision after discussions with Julie, and we decided that the best path forward is to transition to a new CEO. We're going to continue to work hard to deliver shareholder value. I think the Icahn board members will give us a fresh perspective as we pursue those goals. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. That's very helpful. And just as we think about the strategic path going forward at this juncture, are all options on the table or any options off the table? Just want to kind of see the parameters of what we could expect going forward. Ben Fowke : Well, we really like the assets we have, okay? We've completed the strategic reviews, but I mean, the price -- we're going to continue to look for opportunities to do the right thing for our shareholders. But I think we're in a -- an enviable position, that the assets we have can also achieve our strategic goals.  And Chuck mentioned where we are with FFO to debt and those targets. So I think we're in a pretty good position, quite honestly. So again, as I said before, not to be redundant, but I guess it will be. We'll be good portfolio managers, and we'll continue to be open to transactions if the price is right and the ability to execute is viable. But in the meantime, we're going to do the blocking and tackling that in the long term, gets you the result that -- results that you're going to want to see. Jeremy Tonet : Wonderful. Very helpful. Thank you for that. Ben Fowke : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Nick Campanella with Barclays. Please go ahead. Nick Campanella : Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks for the prepared remarks and taking my questions. Good morning. So I guess, you acknowledged in your remarks, there's been some twists and turns and some regulatory volatility in '23. You had some headwinds that you highlighted from the FERC order on taxes, the Oklahoma rate order, among a few other items. But just the 6% to 7% has been pretty resilient and unchanged this entire time. So can you just maybe help us all understand just what's kind of allowing AEP to absorb these issues and where the offsets have been kind of in the 5-year plan that allows you to continue to reaffirm? Ben Fowke : Well, I mean, I'll kick it over to Chuck in a minute, but the $43 billion on the 5-year capital plan underpins the 6% to 7%. In the years where we might have unfavorable weather or other things like that, that's the resiliency of this AEP management team that I talked about. And it's not just one year. It's a -- look back, I mentioned 14 years of hitting what we said we were going to do. Yeah, sometimes you get regulatory bumps in the road and other things that might happen. But if you look back historically, and we look forward, we produce. I mean, we're in 11 jurisdictions. We're going to file rate cases. But if you look at history, we generally do pretty well. And when we have a bump in the road, we figure out how to absorb it and what we need to do better going forward.  Chuck, I don't know if you want to add to that? Chuck Zebula : Yeah. No, Ben, as you said, it's underpinned by the $43 billion 5-year capital plan. I'd also point to what Ben made an observation as a board member and in his opening remarks about our O&M. There's a chart in our deck that you can refer to, right? We've doubled the rate base of this company while basically keeping O&M flat over that entire 10-year period. I think that's a remarkable accomplishment and that's our plan going forward as we continue to grow this company and basically repurpose and reallocate O&M. I also talked in my remarks about the load opportunities. I tend to kind of take a measured approach to this. But we really are optimistic about the opportunities that we're seeing there. As I said, the commercial load growth is just amazing. And we're seeing some good opportunities in economic development activities in industrial as well.  And then lastly, of course, underpinning that plan is improved returns. Right? We are not earning where we need to earn, and we need to have the regulatory execution and prudency reviewed to make sure, right, that we are hitting the mark there. So I think all in all, that kind of underpins the plan going forward. Nick Campanella : Got it. And definitely appreciate the comments on diversification and the size of the overall plan as well as the O&M. Thank you for that. And then I guess, just -- I guess just sticking with the 6% to 7% CAGR, is there any kind of shaping to that over the 5-year plan? Is there anywhere that you kind of see yourself in that range right now?  And then as we kind of think about a new CEO coming in, hopefully, in the back half of this year, is it your expectation that they would come in to embrace that plan? Or would they have more say in where they're taking the company? Thank you. Chuck Zebula : Yeah. So I'll take the first question. Our 5-year plan is really based off the midpoint of the current year's guidance. And our plan is to grow basically on that midpoint between the 6% to 7% range with no real kind of ups and downs identified through there. I'll let Ben answer the -- Ben Fowke : Yeah. I mean I think, first of all, we'll take our time, and we'll find the absolute best successor permanent successor that we can. I think as part of that process, we obviously will have the strategic discussions. I mean, I think the board is very comfortable with our strategy and our strategic priorities. I suspect that the ultimate permanent successor CEO will also be comfortable with those strategies and perhaps can figure out a better way to execute on them. That would be the goal. But we're not looking at a complete dismantling of our strategic priorities. Nick Campanella : Thanks a lot for answering the questions today. I appreciate it. Ben Fowke : You\u2019re welcome, Nick. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Carly Davenport with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Carly Davenport : Hey, good morning. Thank you for taking the questions. A bit of a shift on the asset sale program, I guess, in terms of the decision to retain the transmission JV. So could you just talk a little bit about the rationale there and how we should think about your view on transmission as part of the portfolio or potentially as an area of sort of value monetization going forward? Ben Fowke : Well, I mean -- and I'll let Chuck -- this is Ben. I'll let Chuck augment what I'm going to say, which is pretty much what I said before. Transmission is a great asset. And we are, obviously, the largest transmission provider in the United States, and we like that position. We will be open to things that make sense that would do even better for shareholders. But we don't feel compelled we have to do anything. So I think that puts us in a better position as we move forward.  Chuck, I don't know if you want to add to that. Chuck Zebula : Yeah. I think you -- we're also referring maybe to pioneer in Prairie Wind and our decision to keep those assets. The reality is, right, these contribute earnings to AEP, their attractive returns. And overall, it was really insignificant, right, to our overall financing plan if we were planning on selling those assets. So it really goes back to the root of what Ben said, as we reviewed the opportunities before us in competitive transmission and then looked at other transmission assets that we have, we -- we're embracing it. It's time for us as the leader in transmission to continue, right, to lead that space, and that's what we plan to do. Carly Davenport : That's helpful. Appreciate that. And then, Chuck, probably for you, just a little bit of a shift in tone around the FFO to debt metrics as well for '24. Can you just talk about what we should expect relative to that 14% to 15% range for 2024 on FFO to debt and what the moving pieces are that you're kind of watching that could move you outside of that range? Chuck Zebula : Yeah. So thank you for that question. And our message has changed a bit there on the timing. But what I would tell you is really kind of timing is not what is most important. It's really the trend that we're on, and then it's hitting the mark of 14%. And it's the sustainability on staying in that range as we go through the 5-year plan. So let me comment on a couple of things. Right? We said we would be above 13% by year-end, and we were. And we didn't make any excuses for the soft weather that happened in 2023. Note also that 13% is the downgrade threshold at Moody's.  And second, right, the trend is very positive. Right? This quarter, we're going to have another roll off of cash collateral in Q1. I think the number is around $390 million that will come out of the 12-month average. And also, we are working on down our deferred fuel balances. And then lastly, right, we clearly show our models and review those with the agencies. Those models indicate that we would be in the range this year and be in the range over the longer term. That's what's most important, right, hitting the mark, trending in that positive direction and staying in the range.  So again, the timing, which month or which quarter is not important, it's the three things that I mentioned earlier. Carly Davenport : Got it. Thanks very much for the time. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Levine with Citi. Please go ahead. Ryan Levine : Good morning. Ben Fowke : Good morning. Ryan Levine : Given the focus on people and processes, how long do you view the company's review of its regulatory strategy to take? And in that context, how is the new review different from how AEP has reviewed its regulatory strategy historically? Ben Fowke : Well, I'm going to turn it over to Peggy, who is the point on that. But this -- it isn't like this is something we're just initiating. This is something that I've heard discussed as a board member at the board level. It's something I'm going to get very much involved in with Peggy. We've got a good team, but we're going to have to -- we'll make sure that we do what we need to do to get better outcomes in the future.  And I mean, there's a lot of blocking and tackling, that really behind the scene stuff that goes into the actual processing, executing and planning of a rate case. And it gets really down in the weeds pretty quickly, but those things add up. Peggy, I'll turn it over to you. Peggy Simmons : Yeah. I would just add -- and looking forward to working with Ben and talking through the regulatory strategy. We've had positive regulatory outcomes in 2023. And when we shared some of those earlier, there were some disappointments that we highlighted. But I would bring forth the legislative work that we have done, and that's going to help to address lag. We've done work that's going to help to remove some of the lag in Virginia with our biannual rate review for Virginia, where it was three years before. We're going to also look at improving on -- we said with Kentucky that it was going to be a two-step process, and we very much view that we had a constructive outcome in the order that we received earlier in January with the securitization.  So we're going to continue to build upon that. I agree, we do have a talented team, and we're just going to keep moving forward, and I look forward, again, as I said, to working with Ben on ways we can continue to improve there. Ryan Levine : Great. And then unrelated, where do you see the biggest opportunities to benefit from the data center build-out in your service territory? And given your balance sheet constraints, do you have any reservations or concerns around that opportunity? Ben Fowke : The biggest opportunity so far have been in Ohio and Texas. And in our forecast, for our 5-year plan, we have included the capital needed to serve those customers. If there is incremental growth beyond that, it would be an opportunity that we'd have to evaluate and figure out how we would smartly finance it. And meet the generation needs that come with it. Yeah. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Crowdell with Mizuho. Please go ahead. Anthony Crowdell : Hey, good morning, Ben. Good morning, Chuck. Hopefully, two easy ones, one for you, Ben, one for Chuck. Just, Ben, I don't know what kind of insight you could provide. But just -- if I think about the -- excuse me, 1% position that Icahn has taken and it seems that there's been some major changes in the board. I don't think that would be a big position that yet, I think, two voting seats and then a non-advisory seat. Just thoughts on what change in the Board that maybe to expand the board? Ben Fowke : Well, I mean, you're right. There's like -- I think there's 5.3 million shares that -- something like that that Icahn holds. And we had discussions with Icahn. And we settled on the two incremental board seats and advisory position.  I think back to Julie, I'll just repeat what I said. This was a full board decision after discussions with Julie and the board, and we determined it was best for AEP to transition to a new CEO. So you can read what you want into that, but I think I'm just going to just keep it as it is. It's a full board decision, and you need the full board to make a decision to remove the CEO. Anthony Crowdell : Great. And then, Chuck, two quick ones. It looks like the equity timing had moved. I understand your questions to Carly earlier on -- you are targeting to above the 13% threshold, but I think the equity may be slid off of the near term? And then lastly, on earned returns, what type of improvement could we expect each year? And I'll leave it there. Chuck Zebula : Okay. Thanks, Anthony. Our equity needs haven't changed since EEI. You may be referring to maybe an older forecast we had some months back. But what you're seeing in our deck today is consistent, right, with what we've shown at EEI.  I'll let Peggy go ahead and mark -- talk about the returns. Peggy Simmons : Yeah. As it relates to -- for 2024, our ROE, we're projecting at 9.1% is what we're -- for our regulated segments. And we're going to continue to work on closing the gap, a lot of what I've already said earlier, just kind of building off with some of those legislative successes that we were able to have, reducing some of the lag from that perspective. Anthony Crowdell : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Appreciate it. Chuck Zebula : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Sophie Karp with KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Sophie Karp : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Ben Fowke : Good morning. Sophie Karp : Hi. Just a quick one for me. I guess like when you think about your jurisdictions, right? And the ones we've got constructive outcomes, regulatory and the ones where you got non-constructive outcomes. And how should we think about you allocating this increase in capital across these jurisdictions? Like, is there a strategy there to proactively reduce capital allocations to jurisdictions where you earned ROE just don't make a hurdle for what's attractive? Ben Fowke : I'm going to turn it over to Peggy and Chuck in a minute, Sophie. But I mean, we're always going to look to put capital where we can get the best returns. There's baseline capital that you need to do to make sure that you never compromise resiliency, reliability or safety. So we -- but apart from that, I think it gets back to what I said. It's listening to what those local jurisdictions really want and need. And that can also shape your capital needs because, quite frankly, it can shape your regulatory outcomes. So I'll turn it over to the team if they have anything to add to that. Peggy Simmons : I would just say, yeah, I echo Ben's comments there on -- there's a certain amount of capital we need to continue to be resilient and meet the reliability needs of our customers. And as well as from a safety perspective. Those where we have really constructive outcomes, clearly, we know in I&M, we have the forward-looking test years. We're able to continue to have that capital to allocate there to meet what those needs are. And we just continue to look at what our outcomes are by jurisdiction. Sophie Karp : Okay. And then maybe going back to data centers, right? Do you see more attractive opportunities around incremental generation to support those customers or the T&D investment? Chuck Zebula : Yeah, in Ohio and Texas, right? We're -- those are deregulated states. In our Indiana, Michigan territory, clearly, there would be opportunities for generation there to serve those customers. Sophie Karp : Okay, thank you. Ben Fowke : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Paul Fremont with Ladenburg. Please go ahead. Paul Fremont : Thank you very much. I guess first question would be on the '24 guidance. Does that continue to include contribution from the retail and the distributed resources as was sort of outlined at EEI? Chuck Zebula : Yeah. Our EEI guidance, right, we kind of change the waterfall based on the actual, right? But what's in or out hasn't changed, Paul. As Ben mentioned, we're in the process that we plan to conclude here in the next several months on retail and distributed businesses. He also mentioned that we're closing NMRD today, which there'll be a benefit from that sale coming through. But everything is underpinned. Remember, too, when you look at the waterfall, we took the Generation and Marketing segment down to what we would call much more normal contributions. I'm not concerned that about the ability to take the proceeds, use them as appropriate to get that accretion as we go forward. But no, it's still the same plan, if you will, as we put out at EEI. Paul Fremont : And then Chuck mentioned that the FERC decision is expected to have a $0.03 negative impact on '24. Is that going to be treated as operating EPS? Or is that going to be excluded as non-recurring? Chuck Zebula : No, it's operating. Paul Fremont : And then I guess the last question I have is, currently, there's a proceeding in Kentucky where, I guess, there's recommendations for potential disallowance of fuel and purchased power costs. I think there's also a fuel review that could take place or may be taking place in Louisiana. Can you give us, I guess, an update on what your expectations are and what's happening in those proceedings? Peggy Simmons : Yeah. In Kentucky, we do have a 2-year fuel review that has been underway, and we are waiting, the outcome as it relates to that. We had a hearing earlier this month actually. And then from -- what was your other question with it related to SWEPCO? Paul Fremont : Yeah. I think as part of that settlement on the renewables, there was, I guess, the ability of staff to do a review of the fuel? Peggy Simmons : Yeah, that was part -- excuse me, sorry, go ahead, finish your question. Paul Fremont : No, that's it. Peggy Simmons : Yeah. That was part of the review, and that is ongoing as well. So -- but Darcy can definitely give you some more information on that, if that wasn't clear enough. Paul Fremont : And last question for me. In terms of the 9.1% that you're targeting for this year, I think what type of an improvement do you see as being necessary in order to hit the 6% to 8%? I think in the past, you've talked about needing to improve the earned ROE as part of hitting your targeted growth rate? Peggy Simmons : Yeah. So over our 5-year plan, we look to be typically to be in the 9.5% range. So what we're looking to do is increase by 10 basis points each year. And we think that that achieve ongoing. We continue to work through our regulatory outcomes to be able to close that gap. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question will come from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock. Please go ahead. Paul Patterson : Hey, good morning. How are you? So just -- it doesn't sound to me like there really is much of a change in strategy with the new chapter and the managerial change that you're looking at. Am I thinking about this correctly? Ben Fowke : Yeah, I think so. It's -- the strategy is great. We just have to execute, and that's what we're keenly focused on, Paul. Paul Patterson : Okay. I just want to make sure I'm hearing -- and then the second thing that I guess -- and I think this was asked before, but is there any timing that we should be thinking about in terms of when a new CEO would be in place? Ben Fowke : Well, let me just say I'm committed to stay as long as it takes. So no shortcuts. But I can't see it being shorter than six months, and hopefully, it doesn't take more than a year. But again, it's going to -- the process will take the time it needs to take to get the absolute right candidate in place. Paul Patterson : Okay. And then finally, when we're talking about regulatory desires and goals, having watched the various jurisdictions, there are a number of jurisdictions that I get the sense -- and this isn't going to surprise you, Ben -- they want lower prices. And I'm just wondering, is there any sort of new or innovative way you're looking at the regulatory approach in terms of addressing maybe those concerns, increasing investment, but -- but addressing those two concerns other than obviously, the general concern that I'm sure you guys have. But do you follow what I'm saying in terms of making investments? And perhaps not seeing the resistance that I think if you look at a number of the AEP jurisdictions that they just ease to new investment leading to higher rates. Do you follow what I'm saying? Ben Fowke : Yeah. I mean I think -- I mean I'm going to turn it over to the team, Paul, but the amount of load growth that we see in our jurisdictions, I mean that's a great opportunity, economic development that we can be a big part of, either helping to drive it or certainly providing the infrastructure to allow it. Those are great opportunities. And that's -- everybody wants that in all jurisdictions. But again, we're going to be -- very carefully listen to what our jurisdictions want and need and respond accordingly. Peggy or Chuck? Peggy Simmons : And I'll just briefly add to that. In 2023, we landed 92 new customer load additions totaling about 5-gig and adding additional jobs to our service territory. So I think that that's certainly 1 area and aspect of how we're going to help with affordability as well. Chuck Zebula : Yeah. And Paul, clearly, the data center load that we're experiencing is going to create an opportunity, right, to spread fixed costs, right, along a bigger base and improve the headroom opportunity there as well. Paul Patterson : Okay. Great. And I appreciate it. And good to see you back, then hopeful as well. Ben Fowke : Thank you. Thank you, Paul. I appreciate that.

At this time I like to welcome everyone to the American Electric Power First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And I would now like to turn the conference over to Darcy Reese, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin. Darcy Reese : Thank you, Abby. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call for American Electric Power. We appreciate you taking time today to join us. Our earnings release, presentation slides and related financial information are available on our website at aep.com. Today, we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors. Joining me this morning for opening remarks are Ben Fowke, our President and Interim Chief Executive Officer; Chuck Zebula, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Peggy Simmons, our Executive Vice President of Utilities. We will take your questions following their remarks. I will now turn the call over to Ben. Benjamin Gwynn Fowke : Well, good morning, and welcome to American Electric Power's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. Shortly, Peggy will give a regulatory update, followed by Chuck, who will provide more detailed financial review. The summary of our first quarter 2024 business highlights can be found on Slide 6 of today's presentation. Beginning with AEP's financial results, today, we announced first quarter 2024 operating earnings of $1.27 per share, a $0.16 increase over 1 year ago. We are also reaffirming AEP's 2024 full year operating earnings guidance of $5.53 to $5.73. And the long-term earnings growth rate of 6% to 7%. I'm pleased to note, we achieved a 14.2% FFO to debt ratio this quarter, which is within our stated range. Let me assure you that AEP's direction and strategy remain on track as this team is fully engaged, energized and working well together to enhance the customer experience and investor value. I've reviewed AEP's financial targets, and I have total confidence in the plan's achievability. It's hard to believe it's been just 2 months, since I stepped into the role of interim CEO, and it has been a busy and productive 60 days. I've had the opportunity to meet with many different stakeholders, including elected officials, regulators, community leaders, customers, investors and, of course, the team right here at AEP. All of these meetings have been very useful in helping shape the initiatives I will discuss shortly. Before I dive into other business, I want to give you a brief update on the search for a permanent CEO. The process is well underway, and I am certain, based on the talent pool that we're looking at that we will find the right person to lead AEP. As I mentioned, when we first talked at the end of February, the search will probably take between 6 to 12 months. We will take the time necessary to find the best candidate, and we're committed to keeping you informed. So across the AEP system, I see the need to increase capital spend in the future, including incremental investment related to commercial load growth from data centers and resiliency spend. Specific to load growth, the amount of service request is truly staggering and ranges between 10 to 15 gigawatts of incremental load by the end of the decade, in addition to many, many more gigawatts from hundreds of inquiries. The key to capturing this commercial and industrial growth is to work with parties to make sure that commitments are real and secure, the tariffs and contracts are fair to all customers and growth is self-funded. And of course, that the load can be met. A couple of great examples of new commercial commitments can be evidenced by last week's announcements from both Amazon Web Services and Google to build large data centers in I&M's Northern Indiana service territory. At AEP, we have the largest transmission system in the United States with a high-voltage backbone in the Midwest. We expect more transmission investment possibilities driven by this data center growth, specifically in substations and customer connections. As a side note, I'd like to call attention to AEP's commercial load in the first quarter of 2024 which grew at 10.5% over the first quarter of last year. In addition, we will file our system resiliency plan in Texas, no later than the third quarter of this year, related to legislation passed in 2023, including investment related to hardening and modernizing the grid, expanding vegetation management and, of course, wildfire mitigation. Clearly, a strong balance sheet is critical as we look to fund potential increased capital spend. And I believe incremental growth equity needed to fund smart capital is a positive thing. That said, we are open to equity alternatives through portfolio optimization, looking at opportunities where price meets execution, while at the same time, staying focused on our efforts to achieve constructive regulatory outcomes. On a similar note, I'd now like to provide a brief update on the sales of our AEP Energy Retail and AEP OnSite Distributed Resources businesses, both of which are included in the Generation & Marketing segment. We are working through final phases of the process and expect to conclude that process by our second quarter earnings call. Now let's move on to last week's newly published federal EPA rules on greenhouse gas standards, coal combustion residuals or CCR, Effluent Limitation Guidelines or ELG. Although our team is still reviewing the rules, we will likely pursue legal challenges, while working with others, including our states who are aligned with AEP's commitment to provide customers with reliable and affordable energy. These new regulations in some cases, require the use of unproven technologies, are extremely expensive and establish unreasonable compliance schedules. We are at a time when our nation needs to add dispatchable generation to support grid reliability and growth, and these rules have the potential to not only prematurely accelerate plant closures, but also discourage new dispatchable generation from being built. Now turning to labor management. We announced a voluntary severance program earlier this month, taking effect July 1. We expect this initiative will save labor cost of approximately $100 million and will assist us in managing our cost to better serve our customers, allow us to redeploy resources locally in our regulated footprint and finally, mitigate impacts from inflationary pressures and interest rates. Of course, we will do it so in a way that is fair and equitable to all of our valued employees. So as I mentioned, it's been a busy and productive couple of months. Have confidence in our strategy and team. I'm excited about the opportunities ahead to drive growth and create value for our investors. We look forward to providing you even more positive updates as we move forward in the year, further solidifying stakeholder confidence in our financial targets. Before we turn to Peggy for additional updates, know that I am aware of AEP's regulatory successes and some of our challenges. We continue to review plans to strengthen our regulatory compacts as we work through the past and are ready for the future. Peggy? Peggy Simmons : Thanks, Ben, and good morning, everyone. Now let's go to an update on several of AEP's ongoing regulatory initiatives. We are currently focused on investing more in people resources at the local level, particularly in regulatory and legislative areas. The utility industry is changing and more now than ever, it's critical that we enhance our engagement in this dynamic environment. More details of our related regulatory activity can be found in the appendix beginning on Slide 23. AEP's operating company leaders are running the business and engaged with our state regulators. Higher costs for materials and frequency of cases shines a spotlight on affordability and customer builds are top of mind for us. We are focused on advancing interest in each of the states we operate to achieve outcomes that are good for our customers, our communities and our investors. This includes economic development work across our service territory, which brings jobs and creates headroom from larger load perspectives. We continue to reduce our authorized versus actual ROE gap. We're doing the work and our ROE improved slightly this quarter to 8.9%. Even considering this measure is depressed by approximately 30 basis points from mild weather conditions. Staying with the recent positive developments, I'm pleased to report AEP Ohio's Electric Security Plan V settlement obtained last summer -- excuse me, last September was approved by the commission earlier this month. This ESP covers a 4-year term of June 2024 through May 2028. As we shared previously, we filed new base cases in Indiana and Michigan in the latter half of 2023. In Indiana, we reached settlement, which was filed in December, and we expect the commission decision by June of this year. In Michigan, we completed the procedural schedule and expect a relief in that case in July. The team has been busy in 2024 so far, filing an Oklahoma base case for PSO in January and an AEP Texas case in February. Last month, we filed the APCo Virginia biennial rate review, required by statute from legislative changes attained in 2023. Earlier this month, in SWEPCO, Arkansas and Louisiana jurisdictions we filed the annual formula rate plan. Now on to the regulated resource additions. We continue to advance our 5-year, $9.4 billion regulated renewable capital plan and have a total of $6.6 billion approved by state commissions at APCo, I&M, PSO and SWEPCO. As you can see, we're making great progress. We are also considering the renewables market local input, as well as evolving reserve margins and resource adequacy as we meet the needs of our customers. We are advancing toward our fleet transformation targets, which are aligned with and supported by our integrated resource plan. We have pending requests for proposals for a diverse set of additional generation resources at I&M, Kentucky Power, PSO and SWEPCO with more to come from other operating companies, including APCo. These generation investments are an integral part of our broader capital program, which is 100% focused on regulated assets. Looking ahead, we know there is more work to be done as we advance our regulatory strategies in 2024 to achieve a forecasted regulated ROE of 9.1%. We look forward to continuing to engage constructively with our regulators and strengthening relationships. With that, I'll pass it over to Chuck to walk through the performance drivers and details supporting our financials. Charles Zebula : Thanks, Peggy, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll review our financial results for the first quarter, build on Ben's comments about our service territory load and finish with commentary on our financial metrics and portfolio management activities. Let's go to Slide 7, which shows the comparison of GAAP to operating earnings for the quarter. GAAP earnings for the first quarter, were $1.91 per share compared to $0.77 per share last year. There is a detailed reconciliation of GAAP to operating earnings on Page 13 of the presentation today. One significant item I want to highlight in our GAAP to operating earnings walk is the onetime positive adjustment of $260 million, primarily for the remeasurement of a regulatory liability for excess deferred taxes, due to guidance recently received from the IRS, related to the stand-alone treatment of taxes for ratemaking purposes. Let's walk through our quarterly operating earnings performance by segment on Slide 8. Operating earnings for the first quarter totaled $1.27 per share or $670 million, compared to $1.11 per share or $572 million in 2023. This results in a quarter-over-quarter increase of $98 million or $0.16 per share. Operating earnings for Vertically Integrated Utilities were $0.57 per share, up $0.05. Positive drivers included rate changes across multiple jurisdictions with the PSO base case and the Virginia proceeding being the most significant favorable year-over-year changes in weather and income taxes. These items were partially offset by higher interest, higher depreciation and other taxes. The Transmission & Distribution Utilities segment earned $0.29 per share, up $0.05 compared to last year. Positive drivers in this segment included rate changes, primarily from the Distribution cost recovery factor in Texas, and the distribution investment rider in Ohio, increased transmission revenue, higher normalized retail load and favorable year-over-year changes in weather. These items were partially offset by higher depreciation, other taxes and interest. Please note that although weather was a positive variance quarter-over-quarter, in both the Vertically Integrated and T&D segments, weather for the first quarter 2024 was very mild. Compared to normal weather, our estimate of the variance is roughly $80 million unfavorable, which is about $0.12 per share. The AEP Transmission Holdco segment contributed $0.40 per share, up $0.05 compared to last year, primarily driven by investment growth and favorable income taxes. Generation & Marketing produced $0.12 per share, up $0.03 from last year. Positive drivers included higher generation and retail margins, along with favorable interest expense. These items were partially offset by lower wholesale margins, higher income taxes and lower distributed and renewable generation results compared to the prior year, largely due to the sale of the universal scale assets in the third quarter of 2023. Finally, Corporate and Other was down $0.02 compared to the prior year, primarily driven by higher interest costs. Moving to Slide 9. Overall retail load continues to accelerate ahead of expectations. This is due to our ongoing success in economic development, as well as the rapidly increasing demand from the many data centers finding a home within our footprint. Weather normalized retail load grew 2.9% in the first quarter, highlighted by a remarkable 10.5% increase in our commercial load, which is where the data center load is classified. This is a trend we expect to continue over the next several years as the growth of AI and other technologies boost the need for additional data storage and processing. Driving the demand our existing and new projects that have ramped up more quickly than first anticipated, especially with some of our largest customers in Ohio and Texas. As we refine our forecast for the remainder of this year and next, expect that those projections to move higher to reflect the rapidly evolving situation, as Ben had outlined in his comments. Outside of data centers, our economic development efforts are also helping us maintain growth in industrial load despite softness in manufacturing activity nationally. Industrial load grew 0.4% in the first quarter, roughly in line with expectations for the full year. This was driven primarily by increased activity amongst our plastics, tire and paper manufacturing customers. We are keeping a close eye on our industrial customers, given the higher interest rates for longer environment. However, the number of large new loads anticipated to come online in the next 2 years, provides us with confidence that demand will remain steady in the face of any economic challenges for our existing customers. The main takeaway on load, however, is the significant growth in large customers that we continue to bring online across our footprint. As I mentioned earlier, beyond the lookout for higher load projections, as we provide additional guidance later this year. Let's move on to Slide 10 to discuss the company's capitalization and liquidity position. In the top left table, you can see the FFO to debt metric, stands at 14.2% for the 12 months ended March 31, which is a 100 basis point increase from year-end and in alignment with what I discussed on the last 2 earnings calls. Our debt to cap decreased slightly from year-end and was at 62.8% at quarter end. In the lower left part of this slide, you can see our liquidity summary. Which remains strong at $3.4 billion and is supported by $6 billion in credit facilities that were recently renewed and upsized by $1 billion to support our liquidity. Lastly, on the qualified pension front, our funding status has remained relatively flat, since the end of the year and ended the first quarter at 100.6%. Let's go to Slide 11 for a wrap up of today's message. The first quarter has provided a solid foundation for the rest of the year with a $0.16 increase in earnings per share, compared to the first quarter of last year despite the mild weather conditions that we experienced this winter. We remain focused on achieving our objective, which include improving the financial performance of our utilities, offsetting cost increases due to inflation to keep electricity affordable and embracing the opportunity to bring economic development to our communities by serving large loads. As an update, we successfully closed on the sale of our New Mexico solar assets for $107 million in cash proceeds in February, and we continue to work through the final phases of the AEP Energy and AEP OnSite Partners process. We expect to announce the results of the process by our second quarter earnings call. Our first quarter results give us the confidence to reaffirm our operating earnings guidance range of $5.53 to $5.73 per share. We remain committed to our long-term growth rate of 6% to 7% and FFO to debt solidly in the 14% to 15% range. We appreciate your investment and interest in American Electric Power. Operator, can you open the call so we can address your questions? Operator : [Operator Instructions]  And your first question comes from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Jeremy Tonet : Just wanted to peel in maybe a little bit more on the data center points that you laid out there. And just wondering, we see a lot of forecasts out there on the time line of how quick some want to come to market, and we're trying to figure out how that matches against the system's ability to provide the power there in the connects. And just wondering how you see those 2 aligning? What does that mean for AEP over time versus plan? And just how do you think about, I guess, structuring rates in the right way so that other rate payers don't bear more of a burden? Benjamin Gwynn Fowke : Yes, those are all really good questions, Jeremy. And our team has done a tremendous amount of work thinking this through. I mean, first of all, I like to say, here at AEP that really wired for growth. And as you know, we've been making significant transmission investments over the years, and that's going to allow us, I think, to accommodate this first wave of growth we're seeing from data centers. And -- so in our next 5 years, you will see that load coming on, and you'll see some of the capital spend -- the incremental capital spend to support it. As we get out further in the decade, I think, it's going to be a function of an additional transmission and perhaps even generation that will need to get built to meet it all. But this team is working really hard. We have a great economic development team, very supportive business community in States and we've done a lot of groundwork to put ourselves in this position. And you're also seeing, Jeremy, data center load ramp up at the same time. So that's a natural trend, too. Now to your latter question, this is one I've been keenly focused on. And the good news is we believe that the load growth that will be coming on, will be fair to all customers and in fact, will help us keep our rates affordable across all of our jurisdictions. We are developing new tariffs. Tariffs that require longer-term commitments. Tariffs that require the data centers to deliver on the load expectations that we're building for obviously, credit quality, et cetera. And when you do the math, that load growth then benefits all customers. And that's what I'm really excited about because that was really important to myself and the team that we do keep rates affordable and this growth will do just that. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. That's helpful. And maybe just to dive in a little bit more as we think about data center load sensitivity. Should we be thinking that more along the lines of commercial sensitivity or industrial sensitivity, as provided in your guidance if you think about demand outstripping the forecast? Benjamin Gwynn Fowke : Go ahead, Chuck. Charles Zebula : Yes. So I would think of it, Jeremy, more like an industrial customer and that sensitivity there. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. That's helpful. And then just the last one, if I could. As it relates to the external CEO search. Just wondering, has anything changed with regards to, I guess, the characteristics that are in focus for a candidate? How is the pool building at this point? Just wondering if there's any other color that you might be able to share on how the process is going? Benjamin Gwynn Fowke : Well, I can just tell you that the attributes and the qualities we're looking for remain unchanged from what I described on the fourth quarter call. We are well underway now. We've got some really good candidates, impressive candidates. It takes time to sort it all out. And there's other obviously, things that we need to look at. But the timetable that I outlined for you just a couple of months ago was 6 to 12. So truncate 2 months off of that, and it's 4 to 10. And -- but that said, we'll take as much time as we need to get the right person in place, and I'm very confident that we'll do just that. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. And actually, if I could just sneak 1 last  in. Just wondering on overall corporate strategy, could you talk more about where things stand for AEP decentralization efforts. And looking to kind of more closely align P&L to the end decision maker at the local levels. Just wondering how that's progressing? Benjamin Gwynn Fowke : Well, I think it's -- this is a focus of ours. And one of the -- and I'm going to turn it over to Peggy, she's developing -- has developed a detailed plan. But one of the things we want to do is put those local resources in our communities. And I know that's the right thing to do, just talking to stakeholders. It costs money to do that which is one of the reasons why we did the voluntary severance, so we can free up some of those resources going forward to make those critical investments in our communities. Peggy, I don't know if you want to add anything. Peggy Simmons : Yes, Ben, I think you pretty much covered. We have worked with the team and looking at how we can get some more of those -- enhance the resources from a regulatory and legislative perspective, having more boots on the ground. As I mentioned in the opening statement, there's a lot of change in our industry and having folks out there having these ongoing conversations is really important. So we're working through that process and more to come on that topic. Operator : And we will take our next question from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Steven Fleishman : So just in Ohio and Texas, your wires company, but in Indiana, where these last 2 announcements, I think you've got generation too. And are you -- so in some of these recent deals that announced -- the past week, are you supplying the generation as well? And is there going to be a generation need in Indiana related to those? Benjamin Gwynn Fowke : Well, we do have RFPs outstanding. Peggy, do you want to take that? Peggy Simmons : Yes. We do have RFPs outstanding in I&M. But to answer your question, yes, and are vertically integrated like Indiana, we will have to serve the generation component, and we are working with those large loads that are coming to us on what that would look like. And we are also focused on, as Ben mentioned earlier, redefining and looking at our tariffs as well. So that will be part of our strategy. Steven Fleishman : Okay. And just to kind of clarify back to the initial question. So the transmission grid is built up and has capacity to take on these customers near term. But is there still, even near term, is there more capital needed? Or is it more of this after this 5 years? Charles Zebula : No, Steve, there'll be more capital needed, but I don't think it will be those massive 765 lines, it can take a long time to get built. We believe the team has done a lot of work on how we could accommodate that load within our footprint, working with PJM and others. And so yes, there'll be more spend, but it will be manageable and doable to the point. Steven Fleishman : Okay. And then on the FFO to debt, you're in the target range now. Is there anything about that that's kind of -- are you in there for good, do you think now? Is there any -- was there any timing reason? Or is it you're in that and expect to be in it throughout the year? Charles Zebula : We were in the range. We expect to be in that range now. Our forecast that we review internally and with the agencies show us being in that range. So that's the plan, and we plan to defend that. Operator : We will take our next question from Shar Pourezza with Guggenheim Partners. Jamieson Ward : It's actually Jamieson Ward on for Shar. He's on the road and regrets that he's not able to join you today, but we have a couple of questions for you here. The first was just on the annual customer bill increase, the pace there, you reduced it to 3% increases per year through 2028, which is great to see. Does that already take into account the anticipated infrastructure investment needed to support any future data center growth? Or could we see that number be revised as well? Charles Zebula : Well, I mean -- the answer is the incremental stuff we're talking about and the incremental transmission investment, it's not included in that, but it's not going to be -- it's not going to drive that from 3 to 4. If anything, it should keep it level and perhaps even drop it a bit. Obviously, there's other things that go into that other inflationary factors, supply chain pressures, et cetera. But as I mentioned, this -- we've done a lot of work, making sure that the incremental investment that we would need to make over the forecast 5-year time frame is actually at a level that is accretive, if you will, to keeping customer rates affordable. And that's why I'm very confident of moving forward with it. Jamieson Ward : Got it. Terrific. And then expanding on Jeremy's earlier question, how are you approaching some of the more unique issues presented by data centers, for example, those who want to be behind the meter but still want to have an emergency tariff with the utility or data centers, which, as you mentioned, want to socialize the cost of interconnection through all rate classes but which may not have a major economic impact. If we can just get a bit more detail there. Benjamin Gwynn Fowke : I'm going to turn it over to Peggy in a second. But listen, it's got to be fair to all customers now, okay? I mean this is a big deal. It's an exciting big deal. But growth needs to be as close to self-funded as possible. And that's what I think we'll get with these tariffs and some of the other analysis that we're looking at. Peggy Simmons : Yes. So what I would add to Ben's comment there is that on our tariffs, we are looking at what minimum demands are. Most of the large loads are wanting to be connected to the system. But if they want some form of self-generation, we are asking so that we understand that, and we can include that, as part of our planning. So we're trying to get all of that information on the front end. So that we can appropriately serve customers and make sure that it's fair and balanced for all customers and everyone is paying their fair share, as Ben has mentioned. Benjamin Gwynn Fowke : Yes. I mean the worst case scenario, and this is what -- to Peggy's point, what we're preventing is the load doesn't show up consistent with how we built the infrastructure. And when it does show up, it doesn't use, especially on a peak basis, the energy that we built for. So -- and -- but if you control that, which, by the way, I think, we also have to be very careful, too, that these large, large loads are -- don't jeopardize good reliability. And so these tariffs address that, too. If you do all those things, then growth is good for all. And that's what we're pushing for. Jamieson Ward : That's very clear.  And then on the updated load growth forecast coming later this year, should we assume that at a high level, that means the EEI or are there particular IRPs or other proceedings that we should maybe watch out for? Which could come say, before EEI that would be driving that? Benjamin Gwynn Fowke : I mean I think the big update will come -- well, I understand EEI in the third quarter's earnings call right on the same, but it would either come on the third quarter or EEI unless there might be drips and drabs that get released before that, but that's what we're planning to do right now. Jamieson Ward : Understood. Got you. Last question from us is just on asset sales. In the deck, you mentioned remaining committed to simplifying the business in the immediate term with a focus on continued execution of the sale processes. So how should we think about the potential for any additional sales announcements, following the conclusion in the second quarter of the current process for the Retail and Distributed Resources businesses? Benjamin Gwynn Fowke : It would be on an opportunistic basis. We're going to look at -- we're always open to ideas. Chuck and I and the team have been around a while. We know that sometimes good ideas sound good on paper, but you can't execute on them. So we do filter that through the regulatory screening process, as you can imagine. And then we like our assets. So obviously, the price has to be right. But -- what you're not going to see from us is like strategic review, too, and preannounced kind of things that we're looking at. If the opportunity arises and we can execute on it, then you'll hear about it. But -- in the meantime, our status quo plan, I think, is a pretty darn good plan. And to the extent that we issue equity to fund additional incremental CapEx, this is going to be smart CapEx, good growth for all and we'll keep our balance sheet strong, which I think is so important as you enter, I think, an extended era of higher CapEx growth. Operator : And we will take our next question from Carly Davenport with Goldman Sachs. Carly Davenport : Maybe just going back to the balance sheet. As you think about your financing needs for the remainder of the year, can you just give us an update there? And if you expect to see any impacts relative to your initial plan with the move that we've seen in rates year-to-date? Benjamin Gwynn Fowke : Yes. Carly, the plan that we laid out at EEI is still intact. Other than I think at EEI, we had the West Virginia securitization in the plan, and that has been replaced by a Kentucky securitization, nearly of equal amounts. So the plan is still intact. There's been no significant changes, and we're proceeding on that plan. Carly Davenport : Great. And then just going back to the commercial load and data centers. As you think about that and the expectation to raise later this year. Could you just talk a little bit about sort of what surprised the plan to the upside so materially thus far? Is it just sort of more success on the economic development front or more consumption from existing customers? Just any color on that would be helpful. Charles Zebula : Yes. Carly, it's just mainly the ramp rates of the customers that have hooked up, have come on more rapidly than we anticipated. And so that's why you're seeing those big bumps in commercial load, as we go through the quarters here. Operator : And we will take our next question from Nicholas Campanella with Barclays. Nicholas Campanella : I'll try to keep it to 2. So I guess you talked about this need for growth equity. Can you just elaborate when you anticipate needing that? And what part of this 5-year plan would that be? And then I guess, just -- you do have $700 million to $800 million, I think, a year in your financing walk here of equity needs. Just why not do something sooner than later to kind of knock that out if the opportunity presents itself? I know you don't want to preannounce and go into a strategic review around 2, like you said, but maybe you can kind of give us some additional thoughts on how you're thinking about that. Benjamin Gwynn Fowke : I'll turn it over to my esteemed colleague here, Chuck. Charles Zebula : No, Nick, it's a good question. I mean, look, as we said earlier, right? We're formulating, right, the changes to our plan and how ultimately, right, how financing is going to affect that. You are right. We have $400 million in equity this year, followed by $800 million in equal amounts in the following 2 years. So I think the point that I tried to make earlier on FFO to debt, look, we're going to defend our BBB credit. Right? We're going to maintain a strong balance sheet. So as we put out additional capital forecast, I think, you could assume, right, that strong balance sheet is going to remain intact. So just kind of wait for that update on CapEx, and you should be able to figure that out pretty clearly. Nicholas Campanella : Okay. I appreciate that. And then Chuck, I know that weather at VIU is kind of a $0.10 drag versus normal, but you also have some of these tax items in there as well. Just on the tax item benefits, is that normalizing from last year? Or is that one time in nature, as we kind of think about year-over-year into '25? Charles Zebula : Yes. So Jeremy, about half of that will normalize throughout the year and the other half is onetime. Things that happened in '23 that won't happen again in '24. So it's a true increase. Operator : We will take our next question from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Durgesh Chopra : I wanted to go back on your commentary, Ben, on portfolio optimization, new financing plan. Just to be clear, the financing plan, the CapEx update, the load board updates. Is that sort of -- should we think of that as a separate process and the CEO search? I'm just thinking about the 2 and are those 2 independent processes that we should think about? Or are they somehow tied? I'm thinking about the cadence of your updates, your new plan and then the parallel CEO search? Benjamin Gwynn Fowke : I mean, if I understand your question right, are we holding things back until the new CEO gets in place? Is that what you mean? Durgesh Chopra : That's right, Ben. Yes. Benjamin Gwynn Fowke : No, no. I mean, no. I mean, we typically -- as you know, we typically update all our CapEx and financing plans and all those sorts of things at the time of EEI. And if there's something major in between, obviously, we give you updates. But we're not -- no, I mean I -- this company is not in neutral. I mean we really -- we're moving forward. This team is -- they share my belief that this growth is here. We need to accommodate it. We need to talk about it, and we need to make sure it's fair to all. So we're really, really focused on that. Focused on, I think, the strategy of putting more control at the local level, more resources at the local level. So -- and we just announced a voluntary severance. So we're not kind of just putting it in neutral and coast until a permanent CEO gets in there. I honestly think these are all no regret type decisions that the new CEO will ultimately benefit from. But did I answer your question? Durgesh Chopra : You did. That's exactly what I wanted to ask you, a very clear response. And then second question then, again, like you mentioned challenging the EPA proposed ruling. Maybe can you share a little bit more color there? Is it the carbon capture technology that you are referring to? And then you mentioned the accelerated plant retirements? Was that directed towards coal? Just any color you can share there. Benjamin Gwynn Fowke : Yes. Well, it's a great question. And again, I just -- I harken back to Steve Fleishman's report that came out a couple of months ago, where he talked about our industry, which if you aggregate market cap of somewhere around $0.5 trillion, being responsible for this -- we want our onshore data centers, artificial intelligence, reshoring of manufacturing. And it's our industry that has to do it. And we're going to build all the transmission we possibly can. That's not easy to get built either, but we are going to have to plug in to something. And as you know, in my former role, I'm a big advocate for renewable energy. I think it's great, particularly when it's economic. Now some of that changes over time and regionally. But to think that we don't need dispatchable generation, I mean, it's -- we need it. And I'd love to see things like SMRs and other things develop, but they're not going to happen overnight. And in the meanwhile, we can't -- we have to be willing to move forward realistically. And yes, it's not just the carbon capture rules. I mean there's -- we're looking at all the other rules, the CCR rules, the ELG rules, which by the way, we just spent a lot of money coming into compliance on that, and that was only a couple of years ago. And now it's a completely different role, which would require different technologies. So it's -- our industry has come so far in carbon reduction. And I think we're willing to do so much more, but it has to be with affordability, reliability and resiliency in mind. And I'm just -- I'm really passionate about that. And you never like to have to sue, but we're going to do what we have to do to defend our grid and our customers that use that grid every single day. Operator : And we will take our next question from Andrew Weisel with Scotiabank. Andrew Weisel : Two quick ones here, please. First, to elaborate on the commentary on load growth. Ben, I think, you mentioned that the incremental 10 to 15 gigawatts by the end of the decade. I assume that's across the entire portfolio. Can you talk a bit about the Vertically Integrated Utilities? You have about 20 gigawatts identified through the current IRPs. My question is, how soon might we see more filings to include the new expected load, which there is no doubt coming quickly. Benjamin Gwynn Fowke : Yes. So when I look at those incremental loads, I mean, Ohio, within the PJM footprint, Ohio is the biggest driver of it, although Indiana is definitely getting its share. And I suspect we will have to do incremental RFPs to capture that load. I can't give you the exact timing of when that would be. Peggy Simmons : We have -- so Indiana, we have an IRP that's coming up that's going to be later in November. But -- so that will be part of the process as we start to look at how we accommodate some of this load as we start to see it to come on as well. We'll be using those same types of process. Benjamin Gwynn Fowke : And just maybe outside of data centers, if you look down at SPP, that's a very constrained region as it is right now. They haven't seen a tremendous amount of data center growth today. It doesn't mean they won't. But in the meantime, we've got to make sure we've got adequate load to serve the load that we do know we have. In Ohio, again, we don't have generation in Ohio, so the incremental investment will be Transmission. There's lot of talk here in Ohio in the business community, at the state level do Regulated Utilities need to be back in the generation game? I don't know. I think -- honestly, I think that would take legislation, at least from my perspective. So that we'd be assured of good recovery and potentially any kind of stranded cost risk because we've seen that play out before. Doesn't mean we're not -- we wouldn't be open to it, but it would probably require legislation. ERCOT. ERCOT, we don't own generation, but we would obviously, need to be building a lot of transmission and ultimately needing something to plug into. Andrew Weisel : Okay. Great. That's very helpful. And one quick one on the voluntary separation program. Would there be any kind of meaningful onetime cash outflow associated with that? And if so, how would you finance it? Benjamin Gwynn Fowke : Yes. I think the -- so it would go into effect midyear, July 1, and so the annual savings that we would see this year would just about offset the severance cost. And then, of course, then on an annualized basis, '25 and beyond would benefit from that. And again, this is about -- yes, okay, I'll just stop there. Operator : And we will take our next question from Ryan Levine with Citi. Ryan Levine : On rate design for data center load what duration commitments and load ramp, are you assuming or looking for to help protect residential customers? Any differences on rate design between jurisdictions to call out? Any color is appreciated. Peggy Simmons : Yes. So I'll take that. Thank you for the question. I mean, generally, we need -- we'd have to be building long-term assets. So we need some commitments that are longer in nature. So I mean, we would think somewhere around the 10-plus, 15-plus year range, but we're working through that process now. Ryan Levine : And then in the prepared remarks, you're seeing higher load and potential new investments. In terms of funding that potential new investments in the back half or outside of plan. Any -- how are you thinking about what tools are most advantageous to execute on that potential opportunity? Charles Zebula : Well, as Ben mentioned, we would consider everything. Everything is on the table. But I think the underlying tenet is that we will defend our BBB credit. Operator : And we will take our final question from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Paul Patterson : I wanted to circle back on the onetime gain associated with the PLR ruling that you got -- or the letters that you got. What's the ongoing impact of that? And could you just elaborate a little bit more on -- I did read the 10-Q and that section of it, but I just wanted to make sure I fully understood it. Charles Zebula : Yes. So thanks for the question, Paul. So that stand-alone ratemaking for tax purposes has really been on our radar for some time now. Really kind of results from some of our affiliates today generate taxable income and others generate tax losses, which has really kind of created the issue for us. And really, kind of compounding that is our significant capital program over the last 5 years, as well as bonus depreciation has extended that dynamic. So we were concerned that if we did not address that, we may have a normalization issue. So we asked the IRS for a private letter ruling. Interestingly, some of our jurisdictions support the stand-alone approach, either in legislation or in their own rate making. And other utilities also endorsed and use the stand-alone approach as well. So we received the PLRs in the first quarter. And the PLR really kind of boil down to 4 key facts. One is the stand-alone NOL must be included in rate base. The second, which addressed the gain in our adjustment from GAAP to operating is that the NOL must be included in the calculation of excess ADIT. So that reduced the overall regulatory liability for excess ADIT, which, of course, was created due to tax reform. And then any adjustment to offset the NOL would constitute a normalization violation. So we took corrective action. We're glad that we did to avoid a normalization violation. And our plan now is to work with regulators to make the appropriate adjustments to rates so that we can include that going forward. Paul Patterson : Okay. So that should be a positive going forward, assuming the regulators agree? Charles Zebula : Once we're able to go through our jurisdictions and get it into rates. Yes. Paul Patterson : And when I read the 10-Q, it said West Virginia was -- they've agreed to the stand-alone approach, correct? In the past, they've been a little bit -- is that right? Benjamin Gwynn Fowke : Yes, that's correct. Paul Patterson : Okay. And then just with respect to transmission, FERC has some stuff coming out in a few weeks. And I was wondering if you had any idea about -- if you know what I'm talking about, it's the planning and what have you, sort of long-awaited reforms. Do you guys have any sense as to what you might -- we might see there? And then sort of a related question on grid-enhancement technologies. Do you -- how do you see those playing with your large transmission system? Just any thoughts you have with respect to that? Benjamin Gwynn Fowke : Yes. As far as the planning, I am told from our experts -- in-house experts that we don't anticipate having much of an impact on us. The grid-enhancing technologies, I'm not quite sure about that one. Peggy Simmons : So we do use grid-enhancing technologies. And as it relates to the planning information at FERC. I mean, our team has been very involved in it. I mean, I think they're looking at longer planning horizons and things of that nature. So our team has been at the table the whole time working with FERC on those. Darcy Reese : Thank you for joining us on today's call. As always, the IR team will be available to answer any additional questions you may have. Abby, would you please give the replay information? Operator : Thank you. This call will be available for replay today approximately 2 hours after the conclusion of the call and will run through Tuesday, May 7, 2024 at 11 :59 p.m. Eastern Time.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the American Electric Power's Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would like to turn the conference over to Darcy Reese, President of Investor Relations. You may begin. Darcy Reese : Thank you, JL. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the second quarter 2024 earnings call for American Electric Power. We appreciate you taking time to join us today. Our earnings release, presentation slides, and related financial information are available on our website at aep.com. Today, we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for discussion of these factors. Joining me this morning for opening remarks are Ben Fowke, our President and Interim Chief Executive Officer; Chuck Zebula, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Peggy Simmons, our Executive Vice President of Utilities. We will take your questions following their remarks. I will now turn the call over to Ben. Ben Fowke : Good morning, and welcome to American Electric Power's second quarter 2024 earnings call. Shortly, Peggy will provide a regulatory update, followed by Chuck, who will review our financial results in more detail. A summary of our second quarter 2024 business highlights can be found on slide 6 of today's presentation. Before I dive into our results, I would like to start by welcoming Bill Furman to AEP as our new President and CEO, effective August 1st. Bill brings decades of utility operational leadership experience and in-depth knowledge of the energy industry, most recently serving as President and CEO of Century Holdings, and prior to that, President and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Energy. With Bill's expertise and diverse background, you can anticipate a smooth transition and continuity of strategic direction. Expect more focus on execution, and Bill has the background to do just that, including capturing growth, listening and responding to our regulators and investors, and using innovation to mitigate inflationary pressures. While I will be serving as Senior Advisor for several months to ensure a smooth transition, it's been an honor to lead AEP as Interim President and CEO, and I'm proud of what the team has accomplished so far this year. Now, turning to AEP's financial results. Today, we announced second quarter 2024 operating earnings of $1.25 per share, a $0.12 increase over one year ago. Our operational execution through the first half of the year, combined with our efforts to efficiently manage the business, have put us well on track to achieve our targets. Today, we reaffirm our 2024 full-year operating earnings guidance range from $5.53 to $5.73, and our long-term earnings growth rate of 6% to 7%. Regarding data center load, we have commitments from customers for more than 15 gigawatts of incremental load by the end of this decade, mostly driven by large load opportunities. To put this in perspective, AEP's system-wide peak load at the end of last year was 35 gigawatts. We continue to work with data center customers to meet their increased demand, while ensuring contracts and new initiatives are fair and beneficial for all of our customers. In the fall, we will provide an update on what this large load opportunity means for our capital spend, including generation and transmission investment, and on our plan to responsibly finance this growth initiative. While we certainly encourage innovation when it comes to meeting the energy needs of our customers, data centers included, I want to emphasize that it is critically important that costs associated with these large loads are allocated fairly, and the right investments are made for the long-term success of our grid. For this reason, we filed new data center tariffs in Ohio and large load tariff modifications in Indiana and West Virginia, and it's the reason why we filed a complaint with FERC related to a co-located load agreement. We will know soon what FERC decides, but this is the rationale we used. Given the co-located load agreement is an active case before FERC, I don't plan on making any further comments. I'd also like to note that large load impacts are already being felt here in AEP's service territories, primarily Ohio and Texas, as our commercial load grew an impressive 12.4% over the second quarter of last year. Looking ahead, we expect the incremental load I just mentioned to move forward in these states and others, including Indiana. Moving to another example of capital opportunities, PSO announced an agreement at the end of June to purchase a 795-megawatt natural gas generation facility conditioned on regulatory approval. The facility, known as Green Country, is located in Jenks [ph] Oklahoma, and will ensure PSO customers continue to benefit from reliable and affordable resources. For this resource adequacy-driven capital, PSO plans to seek regulatory approval this fall, at which time the economics of this acquisition will be made public. As you know, maintaining a strong balance is critical to fund increased capital spend to support our growth initiatives. We will sensibly finance our capital needs, and we're open to incremental growth equity and equity-like tools, in addition to portfolio optimization. On a similar portfolio note, the sale of AEP on-site partners remains on track to close in the third quarter following FERC approval. Now let's move on to the Federal EPA's Coal Combustion Residual Rule, or CCR, which was finalized in the second quarter and expanded the scope of the rule to include inactive impoundments at existing and inactive facilities. We continue to evaluate the applicability of the rule to current and former plant sites, and have developed preliminary estimates of compliance costs. While we are working with others and looking at potential legal challenges to the revised rules, as appropriate, we do plan to seek cost recovery through new and or existing regulatory mechanisms. Chuck will have more information on this shortly. Before I turn it over to Peggy for additional updates, I'd like to thank all of you for your support during my time as AEP's interim CEO. I've been privileged to serve AEP over the past five months, and the board and I are confident that Bill is the right person to build on the momentum underway and to lead AEP into its next chapter. On a related note, we are planning an informal meet and greet in New York City soon, so analyst investors can say hello to Bill in person. We are targeting something in August, so stay tuned for more information coming your way in the next couple of days. Finally, I'm excited about what the future holds for AEP as we execute on our strategic priorities and enhance value for all of our stakeholders. Peggy? Peggy Simmons : Thanks, Ben, and good morning, everyone. Now let's turn to an update on several of AEP's ongoing regulatory initiatives. We are engaged in our regulatory and legislative areas, continuing to strengthen relationships, including implementation of our investment in more people and resources at the local level. And as the utility industry is changing, now more than ever, AEP's operating company leaders are staying increasingly engaged with regulators amidst this dynamic environment. Customer bills and affordability remain top of mind for AEP, in addition to system reliability and resiliency. We are focused on advancing interest in each of the states we operate, which includes economic development, work across service or service territory to bring jobs and create Bill headroom from a larger load perspective, and to ultimately achieve the regulatory outcomes that are good for AEP's customers, communities, investors, and employees. We continue to work through regulatory items with the focus on our authorized versus earned ROE gap, which remained flat at 8.9% for the past 12 months as of second quarter 2024. Turning to some positive rate case development, let's start with INM. I'm pleased to report that in May, we received an order in Indiana approving all key items in our settlement, including an improved 9.85% ROE. In June, we received a constructive order in Michigan maintaining our existing 9.86% ROE, with new rates taking effect in mid-July. Just last week for AEP Texas, parties filed a unanimous and unopposed comprehensive settlement with the ALJ increasing our authorized ROE to 9.76%, with rates effective in early October pending commission approval. As you know, earlier this year, we filed an APCo biennial rate review in Virginia and a base rate case for PSO in Oklahoma, where we received intervener testimony in the PSO case last evening. We're at the beginning of the procedural schedules in both cases and expect commission orders in the fourth quarter. We look forward to sharing updates on our progress in the coming months. Relative to future cases, APCo plans to file a base rate case in West Virginia in the next week. While we have many trackers in place to help mitigate regulatory lag, we have not had a rate case here in a few years and look forward to working with the parties to achieve a balanced and fair result. Looking ahead, I am proud of the progress we continue to make on the regulatory front and I remain excited about advancing our regulatory strategies in 2024 and beyond. Let's discuss AEP's recent fleet transformation activities and the progress we made on that important initiative. In May, APCo issued requests for proposals for 800 megawatts of wind or solar owned resources with regulatory filing anticipated in 2025. Finally, as Ben mentioned, PSO signed an agreement in June to purchase Green Country's 795 megawatt natural gas generation facility to help ensure resource adequacy. The agreement is conditioned on regulatory approval and we plan to make the related filings with the Oklahoma Commission in the fall. This is an example of a proactive approach by the team in meeting ever increasing resource needs and we're enthusiastic about the opportunity as we advance our fleet transformation. To wrap up, I'd like to thank Ben for his leadership and welcome Bill to the AEP team. This is an exciting time here at AEP and when I think about the future, I'm motivated by the opportunities we have ahead of us, embracing large loads, advancing our regulatory strategy, and driving overall long-term success. I'll now turn things over to Chuck who is going to walk through second quarter 2024 performance drivers and details supporting our financial results. Chuck? Charles Zebula : Thank you, Peggy, and good morning, everyone. Let's jump right into our second quarter results. Slide seven shows the comparison of GAAP to operating earnings for the quarter and year-to-date periods. GAAP earnings for the second quarter were $0.64 per share compared to $1.01 per share in 2023. Year-to-date GAAP earnings are $2.55 per share for this year versus $1.78 per share last year. There's a detailed reconciliation of GAAP to operating earnings for the second quarter and year-to-date results on pages 13 and 14 respectively. Let's briefly highlight a few of the non-operating items for the quarter that mostly make up the difference between GAAP and operating earnings. First, as disclosed in an 8-K in May, an after-tax provision of $126 million for customer refunds was recorded based on recent developments in the remand proceeding related to the cost cap associated with the Turk plant that has been debated over the last decade. Secondly, we incurred a $94 million expense associated with a voluntary severance program that we completed in the second quarter. And finally, as Ben mentioned, the final revised EPA CCR rule became effective in May. We recorded a $111 million accrual for compliance costs largely related to our Ohio properties where generation is deregulated. We also updated our asset retirement obligations for sites in our regulated entities where we intend to seek cost recovery. Let's walk through our quarterly operating earnings performance by segment on slide eight. Operating earnings for the second quarter totaled $125 per share or $662 million compared to $113 per share or $582 million in 2023. This results in an increase of $80 million or $0.12 per share, which is a 10.6% increase over last year. Operating earnings for vertically integrated utilities were $0.46 per share, down $0.05. Positive drivers included favorable year-over-year weather and rate changes across multiple jurisdictions, with the 2022 PSO base case and the 2023 Virginia proceeding being the most significant. These items were offset by higher income taxes, which are largely a reversal of favorable income taxes in the first quarter, lower normalized retail sales, and higher depreciation. Note the year-to-date results in this segment consolidate the income tax loss that is shown in this quarter, resulting in an immaterial year-to-date income tax variance versus last year. The transmission and distribution utility segment earned $0.41 per share, up $0.11 compared to last year. Positive drivers in this segment included favorable weather, increased transmission revenue, rate changes primarily from the distribution cost recovery factor in Texas, and higher normalized retail sales. These items were partially offset by increased property taxes and depreciation. The AEP transmission Holdco segment contributed $0.39 per share, up a penny compared to last year, primarily driven by investment growth. Generation and marketing produced $0.12 per share, down a penny from last year. Recall that AEP renewables was sold in the third quarter last year, which has two impacts, a negative earnings variance due to the business being sold and removal of the interest costs for financing these assets. Additional drivers were lower retail margins offset by higher generation margins and lower taxes. Finally, corporate and other was up $0.06 compared to the prior year, primarily driven by lower income taxes and increased other operating income related to timing in the prior year. These items were partially offset by higher interest expense and lower interest income from the GNM segment. Let's turn to slide nine, which shows weather normalized retail sales of 4% in the quarter from a year ago, headlined by a double-digit 12.4% increase in commercial sales, which is where our data processing customers are classified. I'll note that in our T&D segment, the increase in commercial load was over 20% for the quarter. This is a trend that will continue over the coming years based on already signed customer commitments. Our operating footprint and robust transmission system position us perfectly to grow along AI and other technologies and industries in need of access to affordable and reliable power. Through the remainder of this year, data processing gains will remain mostly concentrated in Ohio and Texas. But beyond this year, we are seeing strong commitments from new customers looking to connect at some of our vertically integrated companies as well. Outside of data processors, our industrial sales have remained resilient in the face of a slowing economy. Industrial sales were strongest in Texas, driven by an influx of new customers, mainly in the energy industry. Thanks to our success over the past few years on the economic development front, we expect to see our industrial sales continue to be resilient in the next few years as several new large customers in steel, energy, renewable energy, and semiconductors come online across our footprint. In the residential segment, we continue to see growth in customer count and load in Texas, but residential load remains weak in most of our territories, likely due to the cumulative effects of inflation. Bottom line, the amount of demand from new large loads we're seeing across our system is unprecedented. We are excited, challenged, and poised to embrace this opportunity. Let's move on to slide 10. In the top left table, you can see the FFO to debt metric stands at 14.6% for the 12 months ended June 30th, which is a 40 basis point increase from the prior quarter. Our debt-to-cap decreased slightly from last quarter and was 62.6% at quarter end. We took credit-supportive financing actions in the second quarter by issuing $400 million of equity under our at-the-market program and by issuing $1 billion in junior subordinated notes at the parent, which qualified for 50% equity credit at all three rating agencies. In the lower left part of this slide, you can see our liquidity summary, which remains strong at $5.4 billion and is supported by $6 billion in credit facilities. Lastly, on the qualified pension front, our funding status is near 99%. In summary, our second quarter results provide additional momentum this year, bringing year-to-date earnings up to $2.52 per share, an increase of $0.28, or 12.5% compared to the same period last year. We reaffirm our operating earnings guidance range of $553 to $573 and remain committed to our long-term growth rate of 6% to 7%. And as we move through the balance of the year, our focus is on providing reliable and affordable service to our customers, executing our plan, and embracing the growth opportunities that we have ahead of us. Also, a quick update on the sale of AEP on-site partners. We expect the transaction to close in the third quarter and result in approximately $315 million in net proceeds to the company. I'd be remiss if I didn't acknowledge the skilled leadership of Ben Folk during this time of transition at AEP. Ben told you that this company would not be in neutral during the transition, and I can say that that is absolutely true. Ben, while I know you'll still be engaged as an advisor and board role going forward, I want you to know that the AEP team appreciates your engagement and contributions over the past five months. Finally, the AEP team looks forward to the arrival of our new CEO and President, Bill Furman. We all look forward to Bill bringing his accomplished leadership to AEP and working with him as we take on the exciting opportunities that we have before us. Thank you for your interest in American Electric Power. Operator, can you open the call so we can address your questions? Thank you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Shar Pourezza of Guggenheim Partners. Your line is open. Shar Pourezza : Hey, guys. Good morning. Ben Fowke : Morning. Morning. Shar Pourezza : Just firstly, obviously, you guys highlighted in the deck, \u201cthe direction and strategy\u201d kind of remain on track. I guess how much latitude will Bill have to make kind of strategic changes if need be to accrue value? Or is the plan kind of the plan and any kind of changes you expect will likely be more on the fringe, given your and the board's comfort level with the trajectory, with obviously the latter kind of being a similar situation to one of your other Ohio peers in the state when they had an incoming CEO? Thanks. Ben Fowke : Yes. I think that was a lot different circumstance, Shar, but Bill's very familiar with our strategy. We clearly had conversations with Bill about our strategy. So I think it's, I think we're on the right strategic direction. I do think Bill's going to come in and focus very much on execution. He's got a ton of experience, as we mentioned. And so I mean he'll take some time, assess where we are and I'm sure he's going to make some changes, but I don't see significant changes in the strategic direction. It's not like we gave him a plan, a to-do list, and you do all these things. He's going to be a dynamic leader. But the path we're on is, I think we're all in agreement, it's the right path and we need to execute on it. Shar Pourezza : Okay, perfect. And then last time, obviously we've talked about higher CapEx coming, driven by customer growth, data centers, etcetera. As we're kind of thinking about that incremental CapEx, potentially with a 3Q update and a funding source, the balance sheet doesn't have a material amount of capacity. You touched on this a little bit on your preparedness, but maybe you can elaborate on how you're kind of thinking about incremental equity versus asset sales, and with asset sales, how you're thinking about distribution versus transmission. Thanks, guys. Ben Fowke : Yes, I mean, clearly we're going to have an update in the fall, either at or right before EEI, that incorporates what it means to CapEx to fund this low growth, both in generation and transmission, and of course, what it means to make sure the balance sheet is strong in terms of equity and equity-like products, including portfolio optimization. Regarding portfolio optimization, you've heard me say it before, we're always open to it, but price has to be there, and the ability to execute has to be there. And the regulated utility spaces, those are two hard things to put together at the same time, but we're open to it. Chuck, I don't know if you want to add anything to it. Charles Zebula : Ben, the only thing I would add is, right, it's so important as we are a regulated utility and have significant capital needs not only today, but going forward right, to maintain investment credit ratings, and we will defend that right in our plan. Shar Pourezza : Got it. Perfect. Thank you. And by the way, just a real big congrats on Bill. He's one of the best hires. Thanks, guys. Charles Zebula : Thanks. You did mention, Shar asked the mix between distribution and transmission. So, it's going to, there's obviously going to be a lot of transmission that needs to be built, as well as distribution. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet of JPMorgan. Your line is open. Jeremy Tonet : Hi, good morning. Ben Fowke : Hey, Jeremy. Jeremy Tonet : Hey, I know you're not going to give us the full details here, but I was just wondering if there's any way you could help us think through size and shaping of this incremental CapEx, as you talked about, with the incremental wires needs here. It just seems like everything is materializing quicker than expected. And so, just wondering if you could comment, I guess, any shaping there that would be helpful. Ben Fowke : Yes. Well, as I mentioned, with Shar's comment, I mean, you're definitely going to see a lot of increase in transmission spent. There's got to be something to plug into, so we're going to have generation, as well, and we recognize the need to make sure we have reliable distribution grid. So, I think if I had to rate it, it would be transmission increases, followed by generation, followed by distribution. Charles Zebula : Jeremy, I would say you'll note, in our materials that we raised our CapEx this year already by $500 million. That largely is in T&D, right? It's for reliability spend, also customer hookups, and then storm-related capital. So the shape of it right, is going to be as these customer additions, come online. And again, as Ben mentioned, we'll be laying all that out in the fall. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. So, it sounds like there's an opportunity for more near-term, as opposed to just later data at this point, if I understand correctly. Charles Zebula : I think that that's true. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. I was just wondering if you could talk a bit more on PSO's natural gas generation purchase there. To what extent do you see the need for incremental gas generation, across Oklahoma, other service territories? Just wondering if you expect to see more of this. Peggy Simmons : So, I would say, this is Peggy, and I would say with the increased reserve margins that we're seeing from the RTOs and the additional load that we're starting to see across our system, we are going to need some additional generation. And this was a very proactive approach that the team took as I mentioned in my comments earlier, to go out and find some affordable assets that we could bring onto the system. And we plan to make that filing at the Commission later this fall. Ben Fowke : Yes. Peggy mentioned proactive. It really, I think, was creative. It was outside of the RFP process, but we have an RFP process to compare the pricing to, and it's clearly very favorable. So, we're really excited about it. I think it'll be great for our customers. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. Thank you for that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Fleischman of Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Ben Fowke : Hey, Steve. Steven Fleishman : Hey, good morning. Sorry, I've got several questions on data center, or data processing, as you called it. So first of all, just in the quarter, you had the very strong commercial sales growth, but then your normalized sales growth between the two subs, I think was actually down $0.04. When you kind of look at both vertical and T&D, could you just talk to how we should think about that? Ben Fowke : Yes, in T&D, Steve, normalized sales were up $0.02. Steven Fleishman : Right. But then the vertical was down $0.06, I think. So I guess just thinking, when I look at the whole picture, it's not kind of, at least in that line item, doesn't seem to be showing up as a benefit. Ben Fowke : Yes. So, let me comment on the negative $0.06 in vertically integrated. That's largely due to in vertically integrated, we had in the quarter, but a 4.9% decrease over last Q2 in residential sales. And that's largely what drove that number. In our SWEPCO territory, we had in kind of mid to late May into early June, we had a number of repeated storm activity, tornadic activity that took, large swaths of customers out for significant amounts of times that drove that number down. We've seen that start to normalize back in June and July. So I expect that to return to a more normal state. Steven Fleishman : Okay. Thanks. And then on the 15 gigawatts of committed data center sales to 2030, could you just maybe better define what committed means when you give that data point? Ben Fowke : Yes. I mean, it basically means that we have a letter of agreement, and those letter of agreements, Steve, start the clock running, if you will, for us to do work that pretty quickly can go into the millions, which that customer who signed the letter of agreement is required to pay. So that's how we define it. As we look forward, we look at a number of filtering criteria, ownership of sites, etcetera, that we use. So these are far from just inquiries. These are, serious customers that want to get on the grid and are willing to financially commit to do what it takes to get on the grid. Steven Fleishman : Okay. And are those customers kind of committing to these new tariffs you filed, or are we not at the point where they've made the agreement that those tariffs work for them when they've kind of done this? Ben Fowke : Yes. Those tariffs, as you know they haven't been approved yet, but they will need depends where they are in the signing process as to whether or not they will be held to those tariffs or not. But going forward, customers, if approved, will all be required to step up to the tariffs. Steven Fleishman : Okay. And then\u2026.yes. Ben Fowke : Which, as you know, I mean, well, as Steve was just going to say, it's just, it's really important. We're going to see more growth than we've seen in maybe generations. And it's going to be really important that that growth is beneficial for all customers and at the worst case, at least neutral. And that's exactly why we're trying to, that's exactly why we're so keenly focused on making sure that we have these tariffs and the modifications I mentioned in Indiana and West Virginia. And it's just, we got to get it right. Steven Fleishman : Okay. And then maybe just in terms of helping to frame the capital needs, just, can you give us some rough sense of that 15 gigawatts, how much might be related to vertically integrated parts of AEP versus the transmission only parts? Ben Fowke : Yes, Steve. So the way to think about it is, think of it as a 50-50 split between Texas and PJM. 50%, or of course, Texas, right, is our wires company and PJM, take that 50% and basically split it 50-50 between INM, which is vertically integrated and AEP Ohio, right, which is wires only. Steven Fleishman : Okay. So that would be kind of 75-25, I guess, roughly, I think. Yes. Ben Fowke : Okay. I think I've, yes. But we are seeing additional interest amongst other vertically integrated utilities, but that interest is not as firm yet. Steven Fleishman : Amongst some of your other vertically integrated. Ben Fowke : Yes, that's correct. Steven Fleishman : Yes. Okay. Great. I'll leave it there. Thank you very much. Ben Fowke : Thanks, Steve. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nick Campanella of AEP [ph]. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Nick Campanella at Barclays here. Thanks for the time. Ben Fowke : Did we just hire Nick? Unidentified Analyst : I never got the call. I never got the call, but thanks for the time. A lot of my questions have been answered, but I just, curious as we kind of try to think about the magnitude of capital that the plan can handle here. I know that there's financing considerations, but there's also kind of bill growth considerations. Just how high do you think your rate-based growth can get before you have to start thinking about customer bill impact, especially as some of this load should be able to supplement that, but just trying to see, where this rate-based CAGR could go at the end of the day. Thank you. Ben Fowke : Yes, I think the incremental CapEx will be driven to support new load growth. And that's why we're just so keenly focused on making sure we get the rules right. And our modeling suggests that it will be good for all customers. And that's, I mean, that's what makes me so excited about this is that everybody can benefit, load's good for all, and it's going to, there are certainly pressures, on the grid and the resiliency and things like that, but I think the load's going to be beneficial to mitigate cost increases. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. Thanks. And then I guess, since you've kind of taken over, you have kind of pulled some strings on this involuntary, this voluntary severance program, just where are there other opportunities in the plan to cut costs today, or just things that maybe we're not thinking about that could be incremental to the positive? Ben Fowke : Again, as I mentioned, I think, you've got Bill Furman coming in, he's got a track record of innovation. The companies in the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio were extremely well run. Bill is extremely well respected. So I think he's going to bring a lot of great ideas. It's a lot of blocking and tackling, and also taking advantage of innovation, smart technologies, etcetera, that'll get us there. But, the team has done a really good job, if you look back, in keeping O&M in check. So, again, I think the biggest way we keep costs down on our customers is to bring this new load on and bring it on in ways and rules and tariffs that are fair to all. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you. Ben Fowke : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Carly Davenport of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Carly Davenport : Hey, good morning. Thanks for your time. Just a couple of clarification questions, if I could. First, just on the 15 gigawatts of incremental load by the end of the decade, could you just clarify, is all of that related to data centers, or is there anything else in there? And then, is there anything you can provide on how to think about the cadence of that load materializing from a timing perspective? Ben Fowke : Yes, the 15 gigawatts refers to all data centers, and we're not announcing the cadence of that at this time. But it's already, as you can see, it's already showing up in our numbers. So we are hooking up, folks, and you'll see continued increases, over the next several years. Carly Davenport : Great. Thank you for that. And then, just a follow-up is just on the earned versus authorized ROE gap. I know you mentioned the earned ROE sort of flatted at 8.9% on a trailing 12-month basis. Do you have that comparable weather normalized number similar to what you've provided in previous quarters? Peggy Simmons : Oh, we're looking forward to be at 9.1% for this year. As I mentioned, over the past 12 months, I mean, on a rolling average right now, we\u2019re at 8.9% [ph] which is flat to where we were last quarter, but continuing to make progress on that front. Carly Davenport : Got it. Great. Thanks so much for the time. Ben Fowke : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Andrew Wiesel of Scotiabank. Your line is open. Ben Fowke : Good morning. Andrew Weisel : Hi, good morning. First, a quick governance question. Can you please talk about the outlook for the board, and specifically what roles will Ben and Bill each have? Who will be chair of the board, and will it be executive or non-executive? And how large will the board ultimately be? Ben Fowke : Okay. Well, I will go back after my time as advisor, I'll go back to being a board member, and I will keep my independence. Bill obviously will be on the board. He'll be a non-independent director. Sara Martinez Tucker, or Sara Martinez Tucker will be the chair, and she will remain chair, and she's independent. Size of the board, we are basically at full size, and so there won't be any change to the size of the board. I don't know. Did I get all those questions? Andrew Weisel : Yes. That's great. Thank you very much. And then just a quick question on the cash flow slide, page 22. Some moving parts in 24 has led to slightly higher equity needs this year by about $100 million. Can you elaborate a little bit on that? And then looking to 2025 and beyond, I see no changes. Would I be right to assume that sort of just waiting for the update in three months? And just to clarify your comment on the equity-like tools, are you referring to the junior subordinates, or could there be something else in there, like equity units perhaps? Ben Fowke : So, Andrew, first question. You also note in 2024, we had a $500 million increase in CapEx, and versus our plan for the year, we had additional asset sales that were part of the original plan that ended up changing through the year. So, in our financing, in our cash, we received less proceeds because of that change in plan. So, those two things basically drove the opportunity for the increase in equity, and just being opportunistic in the market as well. You're right, going forward, we have not updated those cash flows yet for our annual update, which we'll do at EEI. Andrew Weisel : Okay. The equity-like, was that just referring to the junior subordinates, or was there more to it? Ben Fowke : Yes, that refers to the notes that we issued in June. But we would look at various forms of equity alternatives and be holistic in our approach. Andrew Weisel : Very good. Appreciate the details. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Durgesh Chopra of Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Durgesh Chopra : Hey, team. Good morning. Good morning, Ben. Andrew actually asked my question on the financing slide. Chuck, maybe a little sort of more color, there were kind of more negatives to positives in that cash flow slide. I mean, the asset sale proceeds were lower, right, and the CapEx is higher. Just assuming normal weather for the rest of the year, are you going to be below 14.6 where you said, or should we kind of think about 14.6 as strong as going into the end of the year? Charles Zebula : Yes, our plan is to be in the 14% to 15% range. I'll just note, right, that we're well above the 13% downgrade threshold. So, yes, we plan to be in that range. Durgesh Chopra : Okay. Thank you. Appreciate the time. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Sophie Karp of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open. Sophie Karp : Hi. Good morning. Thank you for squeezing me in. If I could quickly go back to the 15 gigawatts of data center load, I guess, could you provide some color on how much of that can be connected without any incremental investment in your system versus how much would they require incremental investments to facilitate that? Peggy Simmons : Right now, none of that can be connected at this point in time, but as we look at our LOA process, that's why we are looking at any initial upgrades that are needed as we prepare to plan the system to connect this load over that period of time. Sophie Karp : Got it. Got it. Thank you. And then maybe a little bit more of an open-ended question. Your current outstanding RFPs don't have any gas in them. It's mostly renewables. And I'm just curious of how you think about the cadence of needing to add dispatchable generation there. And when it comes to gas, will you continue to have a bias towards acquiring existing assets or will we see some new builds potentially? Peggy Simmons : So, our RFPs are all-source RFPs, so we're evaluating all technologies that come in. And we do believe the dispatchable resources are needed to be added to the grid as well, and they will be part of the plan. Sophie Karp : Okay. Thank you. Peggy Simmons : You're welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bill Appicelli of UBS. Your line is open. William Appicelli : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just want to dig into a little bit more on the sales growth trends. So, on the residential side, you commented that Texas looks strong, but that more broadly, the cumulative effects of inflation have been weighing on it. So, any more color there? Are you expecting an improvement in the second half of the year? Ben Fowke : Yes. So, Bill, in Texas, right, there is customer growth as well as, increase in use or as a result, increase in usage. In vertically integrated year-to-date, residential is down 1.3%, and T&D is actually up 0.3%, largely due to Texas. So, we are seeing, I think, in Appalachian Power, in Kentucky Power, in SWEPCO in particular, and I mentioned, some of the weather occurrences that we had in the SWEPCO area, weaker residential sales in those areas in particular. William Appicelli : Okay. I mean, I guess we think about the EPA activities here, right, because you've got the, tremendous growth in the commercial side, right, tracking well above plan, but that's going to be lower margin volumes. And then maybe on the residential side, going back sort of four of the last five quarters, sort of as a negative, and that's obviously a bit of a higher margin, but, smaller overall change. What, we sort of reconcile that a little bit as we think about the EPA's impact. Ben Fowke : Yes. I mean, clearly the residential sales are higher margin, but, again, I think it's, in particular, the effects of inflation. So, if inflation comes in tame, tamer as we begin to, as we've begun to see if wage growth, continues to close that gap. And as Ben mentioned, right, the opportunity to bring on large loads to spread fixed costs, right, over a much larger denominator, right, should mitigate, right, some of those customer rate impacts as well. So the combination of those things, right, should begin to, slow that decline. But, clearly, the effects of inflation have hit home for a lot of customers. William Appicelli : Right. Okay. And then I guess the other question is, it's come up a little bit, but on the episode of debt, under, I guess, the Moody's methodology, do you know what that number would be? Ben Fowke : Yes, it's 14.6 under Moody's. William Appicelli : Oh, it's under Moody's. Okay. All right. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Julian Smith of Jefferies. Your line is open. Julian Smith : Hey, good morning, team. Thank you guys very much for the time. I appreciate it. Going back. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. Maybe going back to some of the conversation on the layoffs and severance bit. I just want to understand the extent to which this process is finalized, right? You've given very specific jurisdictional level details. And given that, how are you thinking about rebuilding and devolving some decision-making power and some of the roles to the local OpCo\u2019s? Can you speak to perhaps what seems like perhaps a strategic shift in looking at local level decision-making and really what level or what quantity of the roles in terms of overall layoffs will actually be ultimately recreated, if you will, at the local level here? So both the financial question in terms of what's the sort of ongoing net savings and B, how do you think about this fitting within the strategic question of devolvement? Ben Fowke : Yes, I'm going to turn it over to Peggy in a second. But just as a recap, we did hit our targets that we laid out under that voluntary severance program. And we plan to hold as much of those gains as possible. Probably have to do some hiring back, but try to keep that minimized. Remember, there was two-pronged approach for this. One, we wanted to mitigate some of the inflationary pressures that we were seeing, higher interest rates, just overall increase in supply chain, etcetera, and take a portion of that, albeit a smaller portion, and start putting those, some of those resource, some of that money back into our local communities with more boots on the ground, if you will, more community leadership positions and that sort of thing. So Peggy, do you want to? Peggy Simmons : Yes, Ben. So yes, that's exactly, Julian, what we're looking to do. We are, some of those positions were leadership positions that report to some of our Presidents. We are making sure that we are getting those filled and we're adding additional resources in the regulatory and legislative space, because we know that as dynamic as our industry is and as much change as is occurring, we want to make sure that we have that enhanced engagement at those levels. So you'll see more of that. Julian Smith : Excellent. All right. Looking forward to that. And then related, you talk about these staggering levels of the 15 gigawatts of firm commitments at this point. How do you think about that marrying up, especially in your wires businesses against an effort to address generation needs? I know this has been an ongoing tension, but given what seems like yet an accelerating backdrop of generation needs, how do you think about your utilities, especially in the buyers only businesses, potentially re-engaging in that narrative? And in what ways? Ben Fowke : Well, I mean, I think that would take legislation clearly in Ohio. I guess it would take it in Texas, too, but I don't see that happening. I think it's probably a long shot in Ohio as well. So, we are going to have to rely on the market, but our vertically integrated utilities are all going to need generation and in different timeframes. But I think Peggy mentioned, we've got, we do have more with the changes in the reserve margin requirements, for example, in SPP. It creates a resource need, and we're developing our plans to fill that, which will require increased CapEx, which I think is a good thing. And we're really, again, excited about Green Country. The load is tremendous, and it's primarily data centers, but of course we'd be remiss if we didn't mention we've seen industrial load in Texas as well. And I think when we think about economic development, we're going to continue to look for opportunities to bring industry back on shore. And I'm right here in Columbus today, and the Intel has just been an enormous success, and we're going to keep looking for opportunities for our communities, and, again, all customers benefit from that. Julian Smith : All right, guys. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. Ben Fowke : Thank you. Operator : Your last question comes from the line of Paul Patterson of Glenrock. Your line is open. Paul Patterson : Good morning. How are you doing? Ben Fowke : I'm doing good. Paul Patterson : Great. So I asked this question some time ago about Chevron, and we now have a Supreme Court decision. And I'm just wondering how you guys see it potentially impacting either EPA or FERC regulation or anything else you might, if you think it has any potential impact on AEP, I guess. Ben Fowke : I think it's early, but, yes I think it could potentially be helpful as courts have more discretion not to have to rely on the agencies, which that was the whole point of that. And I just think it doesn't bind the courts as much as it probably did in the past. Now, whether that, how the courts interpret it, what, the rulings are, we'll have to wait and see. But Paul, I think in general it's going to be helpful. And we are going to challenge a lot of these EPA rules, as you know, the CCR rule, the ELG rule, the 111 rules. I guess all of the rules that have come out we're going to challenge and for good reason. Paul Patterson : Okay, great. And then just on FERC, do you see anything happening there maybe? Ben Fowke : I don't know. I think, I know there's some, there's some thought that it would, but I think that really, I'm not convinced it will. So, I think that remains to be seen. Paul Patterson : Okay. The rest of my questions have been answered. Thanks so much. Have a great one. Ben Fowke : All right, Paul. Thank you. Darcy Reese : That concludes it. Thank you for joining us on today's call. As always, the IR team will be available to answer any additional questions you may have. JL, would you please give the replay information? Operator : Certainly. Echo replay will be available in two hours until August 6th at 1-800-770-2030. That's 1-800-770-2030 using playback ID 6645529. That's replay playback ID 6645529 followed by the pound key. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the American Electric Power's Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would like to turn the conference over to Darcy Reese, Vice-President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Darcy Reese : Thank you, Danica. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the third quarter 2024 earnings call for American Electric Power. We appreciate you taking time today to join us. Our earnings release, presentation slides, and related financial information are available on our website at aep.com. Today, we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for discussion of these factors. Joining me this morning for opening remarks are Bill Fehrman, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Chuck Zebula, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We will take your questions following their remarks. I will now turn the call over to Bill. William Fehrman : Thank you, Darcy and good morning everyone. I'm happy to be with you for my first earnings call as AEP's President and CEO. In my remarks this morning, I'll discuss our results and outlook before turning to the key pillars of our strategy to enhance value for customers and investors. I'll then cover regulatory updates before handing it over to Chuck to walk through our financials in more detail. You can find a summary of third quarter 2024 business highlights on Slide 4 of our presentation. We have a lot of exciting ground to cover today, but first I'd like to briefly introduce myself to those I haven't had the opportunity to meet yet. I spent my entire career in the utility and energy business. Most recently I was at Berkshire Hathaway Energy, which has an asset base 1.4 times the size of AEP, operates in 11 states but also in Canada and Great Britain and has a diverse group of regulatory interests. While I'm familiar with most of the industry players, bankers, regulators, companies and debt investors, I am new to many of the AEP shareholders and I look forward to delivering for you. With that, I'm honored to join a leader like AEP at a pivotal time for both the organization and our industry. Since assuming the role of CEO, I've met our many stakeholders and the AEP team across our 11 state footprint, including four governors and over 30 regulators and legislators. We've had robust discussions about critical initiatives and I've appreciated the opportunity to engage, listen and learn over the past three months to help shape our vision for the future. AEP has built a strong foundation for growth, including our robust transmission system, which represents 55% of AEP's total earnings stream. However, we can improve reliability, streamline cost, use technology better, and put power in the hands of local leaders to build financially strong utilities in our communities. I look forward to the future and working with the many talented people across the company to drive operational excellence, best-in-class service earnings growth and overall success. I'll begin with our financial results. Today we report third quarter 2024 operating earnings of $1.85 per share, or $985 million. Building on our strong momentum this year we are confident in narrowing our 2024 full year operating earnings guidance range to $5.58 to $5.68, maintaining the original $5.63 midpoint. As referenced on Slide 5, today we also formally introduce our 2025 operating earnings guidance range of $5.75 to $5.95. We have thought a lot about this range, especially since I've been in the CEO role for just three months. The foundation of our 2025 earnings guidance range is based on robust growth in our regulated utilities. This range also reflects lower contributions from our generation and marketing segment due to reduced scope of activities going forward and lower retail and wholesale margins likely to be realized. While AEP's earnings range rose 4% in 2025, you have my commitment that we will do significantly better in 2026 and beyond after we go through an optimization exercise and we retool our personnel and processes over the coming months. As the new CEO at AEP, I need to establish a record of delivering on promises to you while demonstrating goodwill to our regulators and customers as we focus on service, reliability and enhanced vegetation management to reduce customer outages. My objective is to improve our customer experience and stakeholder relationships which over time will result in more positive regulatory outcomes and enable a stable platform for growth. AEP's future growth opportunities are very significant as we embrace the large load opportunity in our service territory as well as substantial upgrades to the distribution system. We are focusing on economic development efforts in our states to help address affordability and investing in our energy delivery infrastructure to improve reliability in addition to new generation to support resource adequacy. Because of this tremendous growth, today we are unveiling AEP's new long-term earnings growth rate of 6% to 8% off a 2025 base year and a $5.85 midpoint, all reinforced by a balanced and flexible $54 billion capital plan from 2025 through 2029. When I look at this newly raised $54 billion capital plan, which is up more than 25% over the prior $43 billion plan, there is even more upside to go. In fact, we see significant opportunity to capture $10 billion in incremental transmission and generation infrastructure investment to satisfy all of the load growth. We will provide more details at EEI regarding these investment opportunities that drive our updated 8% rate base CAGR. Note that during the 2025 through 2029 timeframe, we also expect our customer rates will go up by less than 3% annually on a system wide basis due to built headroom created from economic development activities and new generation. Understand that this customer rate impact could change due to effects of potential future generation needs. Please refer to slides 5 and 6. As you know, maintaining a strong balance sheet is critical to funding the increased capital spend associated with these growth rates and we remain committed to responsibly financing our capital needs. In addition to equity and equity like tools, we will explore asset monetization opportunities to the extent they can be executed upon while achieving the right price. If we do explore asset sales, we won't tell you about them until they happen. Our newly rolled forward five year capital and financing plans can be seen in the appendix on slides 13 and 14. Turning to slide 7, our robust financial outlook will be underpinned by a culture of accountability and execution. This business is transforming rapidly and we recognize the need for change to better serve our customers. Since joining the company in August, we have made several changes to align and simplify the organizational structure to ensure we have the right talent and the right roles to execute our strategy and achieve our objectives. For example, our operating company Presidents and Chief Nuclear Officer now report directly to me, while power plants and site managers will report directly to our operating Company Presidents. We have streamlined the leadership structure by eliminating management layers and reorganizing the service corporation. These actions move decision making closer to customers, all to ensure our money making businesses have the authority they need to accelerate improved performance. I'm confident our new structure will help us drive value as we advance three core areas of strategic focus, growth and financial strength, customer service and regulatory integrity. I'd like to spend a few minutes walking through each of these areas. First, AEP's future growth potential and financial strength is significant with customer commitments for 20 gigawatts of load additions through 2029 driven by data center demand and we have updated our load growth forecast accordingly through 2027. In fact, large load impacts are already being felt in our service territories, predominantly in Ohio, Texas and Indiana. This is demonstrated in our third quarter results in which we realized commercial load growth of 7.9% compared to the third quarter of last year and 10.1% growth year-to-date in 2024 compared to 2023. We are committed to supporting this new load growth in our service territory, but we also remain focused on ensuring affordability by fairly allocating costs resulting from associated incremental investments. This is why we proactively filed the data center tariff in Ohio, the large load tariff modifications in Indiana, Kentucky and West Virginia, and a complaint with FERC related to a co-located load arrangement. Load growth from data center demand has the potential to benefit all stakeholders including investors, customers and local communities, but only with fair and proper cost allocation. While some may think that our FERC complaint is anti-data center, it is actually the opposite. We are trying to welcome all data centers to our service territory by making sure that those data centers help all customers. The second area of focus for us is best-in-class customer service. We will leverage technology to enhance service and better meet our customers\u2019 energy needs through reliability and outage reductions while transforming our processes with a focus on efficiency and accountability. Business transformation and technology innovation will also drive O&M discipline to help keep customer rates affordable amid rising costs and a growing rate base. The last pillar of our strategy is regulatory integrity. We will listen to and respect the preferences of our regulators, policymakers and communities to achieve positive regulatory outcomes. If our states want renewables, we will work with them to deliver. If they want continued operation of coal or investment in gas or nuclear, we will work with them to deliver. As long as our states pay for what they want and we are treated fairly, we will deliver. At the same time, we will work closely with key stakeholders to advance affordability, system reliability, resiliency and security. To that end, we have aligned our organizational structure to strengthen our focus at the state level, and we continue to prioritize improving our earned ROEs as we listen to each of our states and their preferences. While it will take time for this work to bear fruit, this is headed in the right direction. Continuing on our operating companies achieved a number of other positive regulatory developments in the third quarter as well. Starting with AEP Texas, last month, the Commission issued an order approving a unanimous and unopposed comprehensive settlement which included a 9.76% ROE. The order was effective October 1st. In Oklahoma, major parties reached a settlement agreement with a 9.5% ROE in early October, and the ALJ recommended approval of the settlement without any modifications. While PSO awaits a commission decision, interim rates were implemented on October 23rd. In Virginia, a hearing was held in September related to the biennial filing, focusing primarily on incremental investment. A Commission order is required in November, with rates going into effect in early January 2025. Last week, APCO refiled its base case in West Virginia, requesting a 10.8% ROE while also offering securitization as the rate mitigation concept to the proposed $250.5 million base rate increase. This securitization option includes $2.4 billion of undepreciated plant balances, CCR and ELG investments, fuel deferrals and storm expenses. While reduced rate base of $1.9 billion would result from securitizing the plant balances and environmental investments, any earnings impact would be dependent on how quickly we redeploy capital throughout the business. That said, we should have an early indication from the Commission if securitization is preferred and we would plan capital redeployment accordingly. But let me be very clear, securitization is not included in our new five year capital and financing plans introduced today and is not needed to hit our credit metrics. Rather, securitization is driven by the desire to consider alternative rate case options to mitigate customer bill impacts. I was highly disappointed by the initial rate case filing that was rejected by West Virginia. Be assured that going forward, additional internal quality control checks and leadership changes have been implemented to ensure that each of our operating companies filings meet all requirements. A rate case rejection should not happen like it did in West Virginia, and I won't accept this kind of performance from our team. Moving on to SWEPCO, updated formula rates went into effect in early August for Louisiana, in mid-October for Arkansas. And finally, I&M issued new requests for proposals or RFPs for both owned resources and PPAs seeking to secure up to 4,000 megawatts of diverse generation resources for target completion by year end 2028 or 2029 to support new load growth in the region. As such, we expect to make the applicable regulatory filings in 2025. So in short, while the team is making progress towards achieving positive regulatory outcomes, we do have more work to do. We look forward to continuing to engage constructively with our regulators and strengthen new relationships, including by investing more resources at the local level and focusing on delivering what our individual states want as outcomes. The bottom line here is we have made progress transforming the business over the past three months, but we have significantly more wood to chop. Before wrapping up, I'd like to briefly update you on a legal item. AEP and the Security Exchange Commission are engaged in discussions about possible resolution of the SEC's ongoing investigation and we recorded a loss contingency of $19 million in the third quarter. Given this is an active matter, we don't plan on making any further comments on this matter. I'd now like to close by reiterating my strong confidence in the tremendous potential for AEP's growth and success well into the future. With the support, dedication and hard work of the entire AEP team, we are well positioned to continue providing safe, reliable and affordable service while advancing our long-term strategy to deliver value to our stakeholders. Related to our new vision statement of improving customer\u2019s lives with reliable, affordable power, we will accomplish this together through commitment and execution. I look forward to seeing many of you in a few days at EEI where we'll be happy to discuss our newly released financial plans in even more detail. I'll now give the floor to Chuck. Charles Zebula : Thank you, Bill. It's been a pleasure working with you over the past three months. Your leadership and passion for operational excellence and customer service is infectious, and everyone at AEP looks forward to working with you to capture the incredible opportunities that we have before us. Good morning everyone. Let me move on with the discussion of the third quarter results. Slide 8 shows the comparison of GAAP to operating earnings for the quarter. GAAP earnings for the third quarter were $1.80 per share compared to $1.83 per share in 2023. Year-to-date, GAAP earnings are $4.35 per share versus $3.62 per share last year. There's a detailed reconciliation of GAAP to operating earnings for the third quarter and year-to-date results on pages 20 and 21, respectively. Let's walk through our operating earnings performance by segment for the third quarter on Slide 9. Operating earnings for the third quarter totaled $1.85 per share, or $985 million, compared to $1.77 per share, or $924 million in 2023. Operating earnings for vertically integrated utilities were $1.08 per share, up $0.08. Positive drivers included rate changes across multiple jurisdictions driven by outcomes in Virginia and Indiana, higher normalized retail sales and lower income taxes. These items were partially offset by higher depreciation and O&M. The transmission and distribution utility segment earned $0.46 per share, up $0.07 compared to last year. Positive drivers in this segment include rate changes driven by the distribution cost recovery factor in Texas and the distribution investment rider in Ohio along with higher transmission revenue. These items were partially offset by lower normalized retail sales and higher depreciation. The AEP transmission Holdco segment contributed $0.40 per share, up a penny compared to last year, primarily driven by investment growth. Generation and marketing produced $0.19 per share, up a penny from last year. Favorable drivers included higher retail margins and lower interest expense. These items were partially offset by lower wholesale margins and higher income taxes compared to last year. Finally, Corporate and Other was down $0.09 compared to the prior year, primarily driven by higher interest expense, timing of other operating revenue, higher income taxes and O&M. The year-to-date operating earnings segment detail is shown on page 16 of the presentation. Note that year-to-date, operating earnings are up $0.36 per share this year, increasing from $4.02 per share in 2023 to $4.38 per share this year or about a 9% increase year-to-date. The data on Slide 10 shows continued strong growth in load. Weather normalized retail sales grew 2.1% in the third quarter. This marks the 14th consecutive quarter of load growth across our system, and year-to-date overall weatherized normalized retail sales grew 2.9%. Declining residential sales have been offset by double-digit growth of 10.1% in commercial sales. Thanks to the game changing developments around data centers and AI. Also, our industrial sales have consistently grown despite challenging economic conditions for many of our customers. Our companies have attracted a steady pipeline of economic development projects over the past several years and those projects are beginning to come to fruition. Besides the data centers, we also see companies investing in energy, manufacturing and primary metals driving consistent growth in our industrial sales. Industrial sales grew 1/2 of 1% in the quarter, propelled by nearly 5% growth in Texas. Looking ahead to 2025 and beyond, you'll notice that we have updated our sales projections out to 2027 in this presentation. Looking first at 2025, we are projecting overall sales to increase by an additional 8.3% over our estimate for this year. Flat residential sales will continue to be offset by double-digit growth in the commercial segment. This growth is propelled by a mix of new and existing customers spread across our Ohio, Indiana and Texas service territories. In the T&D segment, we estimate about 30% year-over-year growth in commercial sales each in AEP Ohio and AEP Texas. And in the vertically integrated segment, our projections have commercial sales at I&M up nearly 60% year-over-year. Note this is happening now, and in the next several years, not later this decade. New customer growth will also support a projected increase in industrial sales of 1.6% next year, with most of that growth expected to be powered by ongoing economic development in Texas. We have several large energy and manufacturing loads slated to come online within the next year. While these numbers are substantial, we take a lot of comfort in the fact that the large load additions reflected in these forecasts are all backed by signed customer financial commitments. In AEP Ohio and I&M, nearly all of these loads are backed by take or pay contracts. This means that customers are locked in to pay for a minimum amount of power over the next several years depending on their local tariff. Also, the impact of higher loads will enable our fixed costs to be spread over a higher base, benefiting all customers. As Bill mentioned, based on contract activity across the system, we expect about 20 gigawatts of additional load to come online through the end of the decade. For context, our summer peak load at the end of last year was 35 gigawatt. This represents about a 60% increase in peak load in the next six years. That magnitude of increase in peak load is driving the sales projections that you see in Slide 10. We expect consistent retail growth above 8% over the next three years, driven by not only double digit commercial load increases, but accelerating gains in the industrial space. Roughly half of the additions are located in our PJM footprint, mostly hyper scale data centers in Ohio and Indiana. The other half are located almost entirely in AEP Texas. However, the growth in Texas is more diverse and spread across both data processors and large industrial customers. The last time we have seen sustained years of load growth in the 8% range. The Beatles in the late 1960s were still making music. Truly, this is a pivotal and transformational time for our company as we work to capture this opportunity. Let's move on to slide 11. In the top left table you can see the FFO to Debt Metric stands at 14.7% for the 12 months ended September 30, which is a 10 basis point increase from the prior quarter. Our debt-to-cap decreased slightly from last quarter and was 62.1% at quarter end. We understand that in its next credit opinion in March, Moody's intend to change how it treats deferred fuel impacts to align the consolidated view of AEP without how our subsidiary company metrics are calculated. Importantly, based on discussions with Moody's in our annual management meeting last week, their view of AEP's credit is not changing and we will continue to exceed our downgrade threshold of 13% in all forecasted periods. We are committed to a goal of being in the 14% to 15% FFO-to-debt range and regardless the impact of deferred fuel on our metrics will dissipate to a normal state over the next two years. Again, importantly, this does not change our cash inflows or Moody's view of our credit profile. In the lower left part of this slide you can see our liquidity summary which remains strong at 5.5 billion and is supported by 6 billion in credit facilities. Lastly, on the qualified pension front, our funding status remains stable at 99%. In summary, our third quarter and year-to-date financial results put us in a strong position to meet our goals this year and we are tightening our 2024 guidance range to $558 to $568 per share and also in the quarter, I'll note that we completed the sale of AEP on site partners with approximately $320 million of net proceeds received at the end of September. For 2025, we have set our operating earnings guidance range at $575 to $595 per share with a guidance midpoint of $585 roughly 4% growth from our 2024 midpoint guidance estimate. Our 2025 earnings guidance is based on a strong foundation of growth in our regulated businesses and lower contributions in the generation and marketing segment due to the reduced scope of activities as well as lower expected retail and wholesale margins in the segment. Going forward, we expect improved performance in our vertically integrated utility segment as we work to narrow the gap between our earned and authorized ROEs and invest where we have alignment with our regulators. We have also introduced a robust long-term growth rate of 6% to 8% from the 2025 guidance midpoint. This is supported by a $54 billion capital plan which is more than a 25% increase from our previous five year plan. These investments with 63% related to wires and 26% related to new generation result in a five year rate base CAGR of nearly 8%. Future updates to capital are more likely to go up as we continue to see economic development activities in our territories due to our high voltage 765 transmission backbone, our attractive industrial footprint in Texas, as well as the incremental transmission and generation infrastructure that Bill described earlier. Our 5-year cash flow and financing plan forecast is shown in the Appendix on Slide 14. We have consolidated the forecast over the five year period as impacts in individual years due to large loads, generation investments and tax credits will have inter-period movement over time. Note however, the plan is supported with equity, equity like instruments, opportunities to explore, portfolio optimization as well as efficiently monetizing tax credits related to our investments in renewable generation and from our existing nuclear facility. In addition, we will decouple our dividend growth rate from our earnings growth rate resulting in a lower dividend payout ratio over time in the range of 55% to 65%. This will allow us to retain additional cash flow to fund our increased capital plan and new growth objectives while maintaining a market competitive shareholder return. Access to the capital markets is critical and we will finance sensibly to protect and maintain our balance sheet solidly in the investment grade category. We appreciate everyone's time today and your interest in AEP. We look forward to seeing many of you at the EEI conference next week. Operator, can you open the call so that we can address your questions? Thank you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Shar Pourezza with Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead. Shar Pourezza : Hey, guys. Good morning. William Fehrman : Morning. Shar Pourezza : Morning, Bill. So, obviously, big update this morning. Cleared the decks and rebased as we're thinking about your new 6% to 8% growth rate. Asset sales haven't helped, but anything you can point to that can be maybe incremental to your 2025 guide. Any tailwinds that aren't in plan, like maybe on the cost side and as we're thinking about maybe the longer range, you have material load growth driven by the data centers. Has the 20 gigawatts of customer commitments hit any of your numbers? Or could some of those opportunities become further accretive as we saw with some of your peers during this earnings season? Thanks. William Fehrman : Yes, thanks, Shar. With regards to additional opportunities, clearly this year we've done a number of things across the company. We had a voluntary separation plan that was put in place to help offset inflation. And as we're looking at transforming the company, I did bring on an expert in transformation who's worked with me for many years, who will help us continue to look for opportunities to take costs out of the business, look for more opportunities to reduce layers of management and expand span of control of the management team. All in the effort to remove bureaucracy out of the company and reduce bloat. And so clearly there's opportunities for that. I've just been here three months, so we've got a lot yet to do. As I noted in my comments, a lot of wood to chop yet around the company. And so we've looked at what we were able to do and made sure that we were confident in what we put into those numbers at this time. But clearly more to do with regards to the 20 gigawatts that is essentially in the plan. 12 gigawatts of that is in the first three years of the plan, with the remainder towards the end of the plan. But we've got more opportunities out there. As I noted, $10 billion of transmission potential generation development. Again, as I was sorting through the numbers here with the $54 billion capital plan that we have, making sure that that was fully understood and that we could deliver it. But there's much more load growth to come for this company and I would say we're only really limited by our ability to execute on the opportunities that are in front of us. Chuck, anything to add? Shar Pourezza : Okay, got it. And then just lastly on the funding source. So 5.35 billion in equity needs. You obviously kind of mentioned asset sales. Can you just give us a sense on the asset? Is it transmission as media has been reporting, or the off goes an opportunity and just maybe a sense of timing? When do you need the equity? Thanks. William Fehrman : Yes, with regards to potential asset sales and stuff, we won't comment on those until something might happen, but we're clearly going to consider sort of all of the above to get us to where we need. Chuck, you want to. Charles Zebula : Yes, sure. I would just add to that, in our plan we also will pursue equity like products out there, instruments that give us equity credit. You'll note in my comments, we are looking to decouple our dividend growth rate from our earnings growth rate as well, which would drift the payout ratio lower as well. We do have PTC and ITC monetization and as far as any asset monetization opportunities, as Bill said, we are looking holistically at all alternatives. As you look at the needs that we have and the timing of such, we will need equity support in 2025 and how and how that comes it could come in any of the forms that I just talked. Shar Pourezza : Okay, that's perfect. Thanks, guys. We'll see you in a couple days. Appreciate it. William Fehrman : Yes. Thanks, Shar. Operator : All right, our next question comes from Steve Fleischman with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Steven Fleischman : Yes, hi. Good morning. Thanks for the time. So first, the new kind of outlook. What are you seeing in terms of earned returns across the utilities over the period? Are you you've had the issue with the earning below? Do you have that improving over the period by how much? Any sense on that? William Fehrman : So as we look at our regulatory opportunities right now for the regulated utilities, we're looking at a 9.1% ROE tend to plan. As I've gone around and met with the states, as I noted in my comments, our focus is changing to where we will be working with them to understand what they want to be able to achieve, and we will work to deliver that with them. And through that, then we would hope to continue to improve the relationship that we have with the regulator. And hopefully that then also then turns into more positive outcomes with regards to ROE and the general relationship that we have. As part of that, we also have to significantly improve our customer service. I've noted that we have to put more investment into the distribution side of the business, vegetation management, reduce outage time, and all of that will then go to helping us with regards to our regulatory relations and customer service. So we're very, very focused on that. I've made it around now to seven of our states in the three months I've been here to meet with the regulators, and we're continuing to build those relationships. And as I noted in West Virginia, we made the new filing very disappointed in the quality of our prior filing. We've made changes internally to correct that. And so we'll be very much focused on these returns. And I know how much it adds to our business as we're able to get those closer to our allowance. Steven Fleischman : Thank you. One other question just on the balance sheet. I appreciate the clear commentary on the Moody's and the deferred fuel. I just want to maybe restate or to clarify what you said. So they are going to make the adjustment. It sounds like you might be temporarily below the 14 to 15 target, but above the 13% downgrade threshold. And that overall the general view of the credit is that it's stable. Is that fair? William Fehrman : I think that's an accurate representation of what I said. Steven Fleischman : Okay. Okay, thank you. Operator : All right, our next question comes from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Jeremy Tonet : Hi, good morning. William Fehrman : Good morning. Jeremy Tonet : Just wanted to speak to the data centers in Ohio, I guess, a little bit more. And given the challenge there, could you speak to settlement dynamics in your data center tariff proposal, given, all the stakeholder, I guess, views on this? William Fehrman : Sure. As we've looked at the data center opportunities in Ohio, one of our fundamental principles around all of this is to ensure that our existing customer base is not negatively impacted by the significant increase in data center load that is being proposed for the state. And as such, we filed a tariff in Ohio that would essentially put more pressure on the data centers to stand up for the costs that they're creating on the system. And that filing has been going through the process. There's been settlements filed by the data center coalition, as well as ourselves with a number of other parties, including the staff from the commission. And right now that's moving the hearing on December 3rd, and we would expect to get an outcome from the commission shortly after that. But conversations are still going. We want that load in Ohio. We definitely want it to be on our system and we want to see that growth, but we also want to make sure that our existing customer base is not negatively impacted by this. And so we'll do what we need to ensure that we protect that customer base. And I think, honestly I've worked with data centers for a long time. In my prior role at Berkshire and Iowa in particular, we had a significant customer base of data centers there. And I've seen how the load comes on and what the commitments are, and so got a pretty good feeling for how this is going to potentially play out. And we want to make sure that we have everything in place to serve that load, but bottom line is only if we can protect the rest of the customer base. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. Understood. That's helpful there. Thanks. And was just wondering if you could talk a little bit as well on the AEP on your JV proposal with FirstEnergy and Dominion as it relates to the transmission project and I guess what you see as unique or beneficial to this offering versus others. William Fehrman : So that was a great partnership led by our transmission team, Antonio Smith and the rest of the team there to pull that coalition together and go in and bid on these projects. Obviously, PJM is putting forth a significant amount of potential transmission investment and it was our view that we're stronger together as entities and that we would have a very, very good chance of winning these projects. And so that JV came together really well and we're working well together and we're excited about hearing where we might end up later next year. But I have confidence in our team and the team from FirstEnergy and Dominion that we're going to come out of this with some really strong opportunities to grow our transmission business. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. Thank you. One quick last one, if I could just on G&M, seems like 2024 is going to notably outperform initial guidance there and AEP is on the midpoint. So just wondering if there's other segments of the business that are kind of underperforming expectations there. Do you expect them to kind of bounce back next year and also the G&M step down next year given the lower scope of the business, as you said, is that to indicate that there could be sales more likely in this segment than others, knowing that you're not going to identify specific asset sales in advance of them happening? William Fehrman : So the G&M segment we're reflecting about $0.24 and lower contributions over 2024 and 2025, which is obviously a significant change for us. But we are seeing good improvement across the rest of our lines of business. We're obviously also going to be going after the transmission projects that I noted in my opening comments. And then as far as other potential asset sales as again I said I will consider all things and if they make sense we'll take a look at them, but we'll talk about those at the time. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. Thank you for that. Operator : Our next question comes from David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. David Arcaro : Good morning. Thanks so much for taking my question. William Fehrman : Yes, good morning. David Arcaro : Morning. Just a bit of a follow up on that. Could you just help me understand the 26 EPS outlook? Is there no G&M earnings contribution there just so I could make sure I understood that and maybe specifically what's driving it to zero there? Is that an implied sale or exit of those businesses or something else? William Fehrman : Yes, thanks for the question. And perhaps the slide you're looking at may not make that clear. We're just showing the change in G&M from 2024 to 2025. There would still be a contribution from that segment in 2026 and beyond. David Arcaro : Got it, got it. Okay, thanks for that. Yes, that's more clear. And then could you touch on how you're thinking about the incremental new generation in terms of the CapEx that has come into the plan? I would assume a lot of that is going to be gas. I'm wondering kind of where, where and when you'd be investing in that kind of what the process is to firm that capital up. William Fehrman : So we do have a lot of gas coming into the system. We've got a number of RFPs out on the street as I mentioned, particularly at I&M, and we\u2019ll see what kind of prices come in for those projects. The CapEx will be spread obviously as those projects come into play. But I'll also say that as we continue to work with some of our other states, particularly say West Virginia, there's a lot of opportunity yet to be sorted through in those states with regards to the economic development that they are pushing forward. And so be happy to talk more about these things in detail at the EEI meeting coming up. But really excited about the potential opportunities we have across a number of our states. David Arcaro : Got it. Okay, great. Well, thank you so much. Operator : All right, our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, good morning team guys. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. William Fehrman : Hey, good morning. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Good morning. Doing quite well, thank you. A couple things real quickly. First off on the G&M piece, I know you elaborated a little bit what's reflected through the course of the plan. Is that more of a static expectation off the 2025 baseline or further moderation there? Again, I know you clarified the 9 :1 on the utility component, but just on the other piece there if you can. William Fehrman : Yes, Julien, I think that the business supports the level that we would see in 2025. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Okay, all right. Through the plan. Excellent. Thank you for that. Appreciate all the details. And then related here, you know, 765 has really caught a lot of attention across all the RTOs. I just want to make sure I understand what's reflected in this new CapEx baseline as far as 765 adoption goes across the various footprints. And again, I know you provided particularly detail on this coalition here in PGM. But to what extent can we see sort of comparable efforts emerge, say in ERCOT or what have you, as some of the 765 details become a little bit more formalized here, if you will. William Fehrman : So obviously we have a big opportunity in ERCOT around the 765 down there in the event that they decide to go that way. We've put in our proposals for that significant opportunity in the Permian area, significant opportunity on the various backbone growth areas for, for Texas. That just alone is a good $4 billion or $5 billion of opportunity potential there for us on the 765 front. We've also got good 765 opportunities in PJM and SVP as well. And so the fact that AEP is essentially the only U.S. Company that knows how to build and operate 765 gives us a strong competitive advantage in these situations and certainly something that I'm very excited about to pursue. That's one of the really strong strategic things that frankly AEP has done over the years is build out this 765kV backbone because it's paying huge dividends right now as all of this load growth is starting to combine. And I think that's being seen by some of the other decision makers around who are looking for ways to significantly increase their ability to move energy. And so with the 765kV experience that we have, I'm very excited about the opportunity to engage with ERCOT, SVP and PJM and maybe a little bit in MISO. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Yes, it's pretty exciting, actually. Quick clarification on the utility ROE. You're moderating it to 9 :1 seemingly from your earlier plan despite the accelerating load. Is there something else disintermediating that relationship? I mean, I could imagine a few things, but I'm curious if there was anything purposeful there. William Fehrman : Nothing really purposeful. We're trying to continue to increase the ROE and work diligently with the regulators. If you blend in, the transmission component of this, we're at 9 :3. Obviously we want to continue to get up closer to our allowance, but frankly, we have to earn our way up. As I said, we've had some mishaps in West Virginia that we've now corrected with the most recent filing, and we've got some significant work to do on the customer service side to put us in a better position with our regulator so they're not getting complaints from customers. And so as this continues to move forward, we've got a tremendous amount of wood to chop in this area, but we're very focused on it. We've taken our board through the details of reliability and where we sit, and we've essentially created a new foundation and we're going to blast off from there to really accelerate our improvements in customer service. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent, guys. Talk soon. William Fehrman : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Nick Campanella with Barclays. Please go ahead. Nicholas Campanella : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions today. William Fehrman : You bet. Good morning. Nicholas Campanella : I wasn't around for the Beatles, but I'm excited to be here for the load growth and I wanted to come back to the generation comments? I think you talked about working with regulators and policymakers on whatever solutions can facilitate this higher load outlook. You talked a lot about gas, but in your prepared remarks you also talked about nuclear. And Bill, I know you talked about your love for nuclear in the past, and maybe you can kind of just expand on your thoughts of how nuclear kind of fits into the AEP strategy, if at all. Thanks. William Fehrman : Sure. Well, first and foremost, a number of our customers are pursuing projects based on nuclear power plants, and those are many, many years out, as far as I can tell. But we need to continue to work with our customers and if they want to pursue a small modular reactor type of co-location approach, then we'll work with them and we'll continue to work with developers of the various technologies that are out there. But this is going to require a very significant approach to risk mitigation. It will take a combination of the federal government, state government, input from the customer and ourself to build some risk mitigation such that our existing customer base isn't carrying the full exposure of something like this. And we'll, with our nuclear team that we have here, we'll continue to follow the various technologies that are being built in Canada with regards to the BWRX and the new scale plant that's being built in Romania. We'll follow those as well as the GE Hitachi project at TVA and watch how these are progressing. But ultimately if our customers want this and our states want this, then we'll have to figure out a way to deliver it. That's what we do. And so I'm fairly favorable that there'll be one or two designs that make it through the NRC process and will start to be built. But we have to figure out the first of a kind risk and make sure that we are not carrying that, that load and that there's a very broad base of people engaged in this that can help push this along. Nicholas Campanella : Hey, I really appreciate your thoughts there. And just to tie things off on the 6% to 8% growth rate, so you have 8% rate base growth net of some financing drag. You could also be raising CapEx here too, I hear you on the 10 billion. Where do you kind of think you're trending in this new 6% to 8% range? Over the long-term, do you kind of grow linearly off this midpoint? Could you be kind of higher or lower in certain years? Just trying to understand that. Thank you. Charles Zebula : Yes, thanks Nick. The 6% to 8% right is based off the 2025 new midpoint. And as you can imagine, as Bill described, the kind of components of our capital plan and the addition of load over time, I don't expect it to be completely linear like it may have been in the past. So I do expect all years to be in that range. But I certainly don't expect a --if our guidance was linear, we would have just said 7%. Our guidance is 6% to 8%. I think that does mean over the long-term we would average somewhere in between there, but I don't expect it necessarily to be linear. Nicholas Campanella : Very helpful though, still within the ranges. I appreciate the time today. Thanks so much. Operator : Our next question comes from Carly Davenport with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Carly Davenport : Hey, good morning. Thanks so much for taking the questions. Maybe just to start a quick follow up on transmission as we look at the new capital plan, obviously significant increases on that side relative to the prior plan. Just as you think about some of the opportunities in PJM that you ran through in I think Jeremy's question, are those all upside to the plan or is there any spend built in in the back end of this plan related to those opportunities? Charles Zebula : Yes, this is all basically upside to the plan. And as I mentioned in my remarks, the potential for $10 billion of additional transmission and new generation build out is what we would be chasing with regards to not only just PJM, but ERCOT, MISO and SPP as well. Carly Davenport : Got it. Great, that's helpful. And then just lastly, with the increase in the long-term earnings growth rate to that 6% to 8% range, could you just talk a little bit about how you're thinking about dividend growth relative to that range going forward? Charles Zebula : Yes. So Carly, we have followed a pattern of pretty much matching dividend growth, right. With our earnings growth, with the increased capital needs, the cash right from decoupling. Right. The dividend growth from the earnings growth will help fund that. And we would be targeting, a payout ratio in the 55% to 65% range. Our old policy was 60% to 70%. I think right now our payout ratio is in that 63%, 64% range. So we will provide a market competitive total shareholder return opportunity for our shareholders. But that will be decoupled going forward. Carly Davenport : Got it. Great. Thank you so much for the color. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrew Wiesel with Scotiabank. Please go ahead. Andrew Wiesel : Hi. Thank you. Good morning everyone. If I could first follow up on that dividend question. Are you able to indicate how quickly you expect to go from the roughly 64% to roughly 60%? Or said differently, if earnings are growing at 6% to 8%, what would be a good expectation for dividend growth? Would it be 6% like we've seen, or potentially something slower? Charles Zebula : Well, that's a discussion, Andrew. That is, as you know that the board, approves the dividend and we will drift down in that range. It won't be anything significantly abrupt to expect there, but you could imagine, right. That we would just drift down in that range as we go through time. Andrew Wiesel : Okay, so sounds like something fairly gradual then. If that's maybe a fair way to put it. Okay. Then on the -- great, thank you. Then on equity, I just want to better understand, I see this slide shows 100 million per year of drip and I fully understand your commentary that asset sales or something like a hybrid might mitigate the need. But for modeling purposes, should we take that 5.35 billion and straight line it over five years? Maybe you could give a little more guidance in terms of timing per year and if this would be an ATM or a block in the absence of one of those alternatives. Thank you. Charles Zebula : Yes, so it's a good question. Obviously, consolidating the five year cash flow, just indicates that there's a lot of options on the table. What I would tell you that as I said earlier, we do need equity support in some form in 2025 and 2026 to continue to hit our credit metrics. So I think, as you maybe looked at last year's kind of shape and think of it in a similar way, is a good way to perhaps look at it because we do need support in 2025 in some form or fashion. And we are holistically looking at all of the options, including the equity like securities which wouldn't show up in the true equity line on the cash flow. Andrew Wiesel : Okay, can that be a little more direct? What's embedded in the assumption for share count for 2025? Charles Zebula : I don't have that specifically. We could talk about that at EEI. Andrew Wiesel : Okay, sounds good. Charles Zebula : You could follow up with Darcy later. Andrew Wiesel : Very good. Operator : Our next question comes from Bill Appicelli with UBS. Please go ahead. William Appicelli : Hi, good morning. Just a question about the. You talked about some of the funding over the years and with the efficient monetization tax credits, can you speak to the magnitude of the tax credits or these going to be contributing to earnings or is this utilization of transferability to provide funding? Charles Zebula : Yes, it's just transferability to provide funding. It's neutral to earnings largely. And over the 2025 to 2027 period, it's roughly $300 million a year. In the latter two years there's some ITC opportunities with some solar projects. So you'd be some big, bigger numbers, but in the next three years, about an average of 300 per year. William Appicelli : Okay, thank you. And then on the sales outlook on residential, so that had been, trailing a little bit behind expectations, but you are assuming some improvement, back to relatively flatter or slightly positive next year maybe. Can you speak to what's driving that? Charles Zebula : Yes, I mean, it's a trend I think that we and others are seeing in the industry as well as people have returned to work as inflation has crept in and the share of the wallet becomes more critical. I think you're just seeing reduced usage. We are seeing increased customer counts, in places like Texas and Oklahoma and Ohio and other areas. But it's not offsetting, right. The existing customer decline in usage. We do think that that levels off at some point in time. I think there's also probably some energy, continued energy efficiency things creeping in there. But nonetheless, we're as we, as you see in our forecast, after some years of decline, we're now assuming it flat going forward pretty much. William Appicelli : Okay. All right. And then just lastly, maybe just you can speak to the colocation issues, that FERC has recently addressed. You guys did intervene in the case. Maybe can you just highlight what you think next steps are, coming out of FERC or some of the policy issues more broadly? William Fehrman : Yes sure. So this is a very simple issue in our mind. If you use the transmission system, you should pay for it. It's really that simple. And our view of colocation is that we don't have an issue with colocation. We don't have an issue with data centers looking to use nuclear power plants as an energy source. But what we do have an issue with is when they use the transmission system and try not to pay for it. That's a problem for us because that cost gets shifted to other customers. And so as this process continues to go through the FERC decision making process, we'll continue to reiterate our concerns around cost allocation. And at the end of the day for us it's, it's just a simple principle. If you use the transmission system, pay for it. And that's really where we're at. William Appicelli : Okay, great. See you next week. Thank you. William Fehrman : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Anthony Crowdell with Mizuho. Please go ahead. Anthony Crowdell : Hey, good morning. Hey, Nick. Did. I'm sorry, Chuck, did Nick have you write that Beatles reference? Charles Zebula : I think he may have. I think he may have. Anthony Crowdell : Well, that's great. Just two cleanups. I think one of them to Julien's question on the ROE improvement that you're seeing, 9.1%. What's a fair assumption where we should start baking in that improvement? Is it gradual over time or is that something you think we could bake in a certain year? Charles Zebula : Yes. So trailing 12 months, as you could see in the deck, we're at 9.0% for the entire regulated complex. So I think as you think about going into next year, you should think about that. The regulated utilities in the range of 9.1% and the Transco right in that 10.5% range, which then averages things to 9.3%. Anthony Crowdell : Great. And then you talk about the load growth, the data centers, great tailwinds. I'm just curious. It was maybe something investors were asking about maybe six months ago, but even with all this demand, is it taking longer to connect these large customers to the system or. It's at a very manageable pace for the company. I'm just thinking that with all this load coming on, whether it's supply chain or just labor connecting all these large customers, but it doesn't appear to be an issue. William Fehrman : Well, it's certainly a challenge for us to get everyone connected at the speed that they would like to be connected, which is tomorrow for the most part. And we're working with data centers to try to find creative ways to allow them to continue to build out and get the power that they need. But this is going to be a long-term build out for us and we'll try to connect as many data centers as we can onto the system. We'll try to come up with other creative options for those data centers while we get transmission built. But it's going to be an evolution of working with the customer, working with particularly PJM and then our ability to get the construction done. I don't foresee significant supply chain issues at this time. The construction is fairly well spread out and I think we can manage the supply chain side of this. But we certainly have a very high demand coming on from the data center crowd and will work hard to try to accomplish what they want as quickly as we can. Anthony Crowdell : Thanks for taking my questions. See you in EEI. William Fehrman : Thank you. Operator : All right, and our final question from today with Ryan Levine with Citi. Please go ahead. Ryan Levine : Thanks for taking my questions. I guess a couple one, in terms of your confidence level and these load forecasts, how confident are you and when do you think you that could evolve? William Fehrman : Well, as we stated earlier, we've got essentially signed contracts for all of this load, so we feel very confident about the load coming on. Certainly we're in discussions with a number of other economic development opportunities across a number of our states. Those clearly are not in our plan, nor do we know if they'll come to fruition. But for what we're showing you, we have signed agreements and our confidence level is quite high. Ryan Levine : And then in terms of the recent election, with federal tax rates potentially to change in coming years, how exposed is your free cash flow and credit outlook to changes in federal policy And I guess on a similar vein, you have generation build out and ownership expected in your plan. Is there any exposure to tariffs that you're thinking through? William Fehrman : Yes, I mean, it's a question we're going to have to evaluate here as we go through time and see what the platform for the new administration is going to be. So give us some time to absorb that. Ryan Levine : Okay. Thanks for taking my questions. William Fehrman : Yes. Thank you. Darcy Reese : Thank you for joining us on today's call. As always, the IR team will be available to answer any additional questions you may have. Danica, would you please give the replay information? Operator : Thank you.
